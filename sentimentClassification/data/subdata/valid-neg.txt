jameson parker and marilyn hassett are the screen s most unbelievable couple since john travolta and lily tomlin larry peerce s direction wavers uncontrollably between black farce and roman tragedy robert klein certainly think it s the former and his self centered performance in a minor role underscores the total lack of balance and chemistry between the players in the film normally i don t like to let myself get so ascerbic but the bell jar is one of my all time favorite books and to watch what they did with it makes me literally crazy
i bought this movie and after i watched it i decided that i did not care for it the acting was bad was the principal a robot he had no personality and his facial expression didn t change through the whole movie at times the voices didn t match up people talking and their lips didn t even move
after having seen the canadian icelandic british production of beowulf grendel which i thought brilliant and stunning i approached this the first of newer beowulf movies due out this year with trepidation as soon as i heard viking and saw the horned helmets i groaned these were migration era swedes and danes not vikings they came later and even the vikings never wore horns on their helmets horns make it easy for your enemy to knock your helmet off and then brain you then there s hrolfgar s palace which looks like a set for a movie about greece or rome not th century denmark the swords and armor look like props left over from earlier films set in various historic periods i spotted weapons that might have been used by crusaders in kingdom of heaven and one character was even wielding a windlass steelcrafts reproduction movie sword from beowulf grendel beyond the basic plot of the original epic poem the writing was dismal and the acting totally wooden and unconvincing the biggest yuk was a secret weapon crossbow complete with sighting scope and exploding projectiles that looked like something bought from iraqi insurgents the special effects monster and his mom were so on steroids that beowulf could never have torn off an arm as he did in the poem thank the gods for bazooka crossbows i could go on but i won t
well how was i suppose to know this was the dumb ass promotional lordi motion picture i mean i realized this when that dinosaur costume showed up and by the time the lead singer made his appearance i was humming hard rock hallelujah to myself even though i hate that song dark floors is about a young autistic girl who is in the process of being sneaked out of the hospital by her over protective father when they and the rest of the people in that particular elevator become momentarily trapped when they arrive at their floor it comes as quite a surprise to find that there is nobody else around the hospital is empty except for a variety of monsters that seem to be stalking them for no apparent reason they run through the hallways and stairwells encountering all of the band members of the heavy metal band in their outlandish shock rock costumes nothing really memorable here except the lousy acting lack of gore nudity and the utterly shameless promotional edge reminding me very much of kiss meet the phantom of the park yeah remember that dud wish i didn t i would just recommend avoiding all of these ghost house films like a fungus and not listen to lordi since they are a gwar ripoff band
wow this one sucks i m gonna sum it up as quickly as possible a count invites naive sluts back to his castle a bunch of nothing happens for a long time some lame and un erotic soft core sex scenes happen some girls get their heads cut off off screen the end the only things going for this one are the decent looking sets and costumes some bad dubbing which leads to some unintentionally funny dialogue and a few brief nudie shots and believe me those things are not enough to redeem the minutes of tedium that this film is in fact the best part is the tacked on beginning from the distributor that features some slutty goth chicks covered in blood and showing their tits and again this is definitely not worth the price of admission for this garbage as everyone else has noted the title of the film is completely nonsensical as there s absolutely no bloodsucking nor dancing of any sort in the film at all it may as well have been called the goat raper leads the circle jerk and at least then it would have had a better title that also pertains to nothing in the film an accurate title would have been minutes of torture another alluring title that would have at least been truthful for the viewer honestly the trailer that s on the disc shows all the best parts and i use the term best extremely loosely so i highly suggest watching that instead if you re still curious i can t imagine anyone liking this wreck of a film please take my advice and leave this one on the shelf
things get dull early an often in this in this mawkish jazz bio fiction written and directed by spike lee bleek gilliam denzell washington is a happenin jazz trumpeter that fronts a quintet packing them in at below the underdog his problems include an incompetent manager a stage hogging sax player and two girlfriends that he s playing musical mattress with the real love of his life though is his trumpet and his music the band s manager giant has a dangerous gambling problem and proves to be an ineffective negotiator with greedy club owners and would be best jettisoned but bleek remains loyal for as long as possible it will prove to his undoing as an artist but ironically contribute to his growth as a man as bleek denzell washington is all wrong as the ambitious trumpeter with a babe on each arm he s too sweet a guy to be so self centered about his art dispensing patience and love to those close to him with a low key remoteness he simply lacks the fire wesley snipes who plays henderson the sax player would have been far more suited for the role but even he would have to mouth the flaccid throw away scribblings of lee s torpid dialogue as giant lee hits the trifecta with an abysmal performance to match his writing and direction loosely attempting to mirror the grubby but sympathetic ratso rizzo to bleek s joe buck he adopts a limp and even the i m walkin here moment from midnight cowboy in this case you wish the taxi would run him over and be done with it lee s script is all tepid argument heavy handed ribbing and veiled insult with some requisite clumsy editorializing that lee has to inject to remain down the scenes between the band members backstage and in rehearsal lack spark and are only surpassed in dreariness by the bleek giant conversations that have an ad lib look and go in circles completing this travesty is lee s pretentious visual style tracking shots zooms and pans are wasted and without significance to scenes they just wander blues is lee s love letter to jazz made implicit by the mountains of memorabilia plastered all over the sets and it s all sentimental clap trap that lacks passion and verve jazz on film is better served by tavernier s round midnight and eastwood s bird which get below the surface reveal more sides of the form the pain behind it in addition to offering infinitely superior lead performances by forrest whitaker and the real deal dexter gordon this spike lee joint doesn t even offer a mild buzz it s some pretty bad homegrown
in an otherwise good review loleralacartelort says the truth is that the americans use a secret aluminum anti radiation alloy it is not that well known and the exact specifications are a secret and why is it a secret well why should they reveal it back then if they where in a space race with the russians then it would be very dumb to reveal that they had new technology that could shield crew against radiation this is completely incorrect there is and was no secret to radiation protection in apollo the design and construction of the apollo command module has long been publicly available it uses a lightweight honeycomb of aluminum and stainless steel the entire outer surface except the windows of course is covered with a heat shield made of a phenolic resin thicker on the bottom that faces forward during re entry these materials are actually better at stopping the kind of radiation we have in space charged particles than lead which is better suited to stopping ionizing photons like x rays and gamma rays space radiation is a definite problem for long term space flight because of the risk of big solar flares but it simply wasn t a serious threat to the apollo astronauts the command module gave them pretty good protection during their brief hour or so passage through the van allen belts they all carried dosimeters so we know exactly how much radiation they each received no more than rem and usually much less of the men who flew to the moon of whom landed are still alive only two have died from cancer alan shepard leukemia and jack swigert bone cancer the rest died from heart attacks pancreatitis roosa and a motorcycle accident conrad these are actually pretty good statistics for a group of men now in their late s shepard would be
i m not sure this is a spoiler perhaps it is a public service if you are one of those people focused on instant gratification who skip end credits you will miss the final line of the end credits news announcer s voice over which states the u s has just surrendered to nazi germany on may to end wwii here are just a few of the problems with this close the older viewer must conjure up the equivalent of two or three more unholy movies in their mind s eye to fill in the yawning chasm between movie events and this startling conclusion the average person will really kick themselves that they did not watch one of these unholy fill in the blanks flicks created in their own head for free instead of shelling out time and money to see this unholy from the video store or on cable this end credits sequence of imagined news bulletins may be the first information some younger viewers are exposed to about wwii leading them to the conclusion that george w bush is the latest heir to the nazi throne
i ve seen a lot of movies and rarely would i ever rate a movie but this movie was beyond terrible the acting was terrible the plot was ridiculous the effects were unrealistic and the characters were annoying usually when i watch scary movies i think it s dumb when the characters hears a noise in house forest school etc and then yells out hello is anyone there but at least they re believable when they do it this movie couldn t even get that right this is a movie that ll make other b horror movies like venom and the fog look like academy award winning masterpieces i always have an open mind while watching movies and i can only say that this movie was a complete waste of time and i write this comment so that anyone else who s thinking of watching this movie will think again it s awful
a movie about a bunch of some kind of filmmakers who want to make a documentary on a new kind of surfing in shark infested waters as an absolute fan of movies including some kind of vicious animals or monsters i thought this might be my kind of movie it wasn t this should be more of a guideline of how not to do it it has a lot of accidental humor in it and the evil beast is an incredible joke in the final scene it goes after the main characters rolling the feet are obviously waving in the air it looks ridiculous good for a laugh though if it were only for the lack of talent between the actors the embarrassingly stupid dialogs and the hilariously stupid crocodile it would be at least worth a laugh but it gets worse i d guess the people in charge of this movie noticed how weak it was so they though up the old idea of sex sells totally i mean totally without any reasons one of the main actresses shows her breasts to the beast and somewhere towards the beginning there s some kind of meaningless makeout this is the last ingredient making the movie absolute trash to me it s incredible how people actually spend time producing such rubbish if you are seeking for a real waste of time watch this movie
jeez only in the s antonio margheriti brings us this quirky hybrid of spaghetti western and kung fu flick evolving around a treasure hunt the spices of this trashy co production between shaw brothers and an italian one off company include humorous storytelling off the wall happenings and some very tame t a extra campy moments are being served by lee van cleef s obnoxious wig leather clad bible thumping psycho gunman yancey hobbitt loveably hammed up by julian ugarte the man who should ve done way more obscure european genre productions than he did wanna be witty dialogue hilarious background music and completely laughable sound effects accompanying various little events especially every jump made by lo lieh while this little piece of action falls fare and square into the turkey territory it s great to see van cleef and lo lieh on the same screen and you can t deny the charisma of this duo don t expect too much and you ll get plenty out of it this is my truth what is yours
i can t quite say that jerry springer ringmaster is the worst film i have ever seen the film would be better off if it were because at least the worst film i ve ever seen prom night ii interested me enough for me to hate it my only reaction after leaving the theatre happened when i looked up at the clock and discovered that only minutes had passed it had seemed much more like years it is an endless repetition of poor people or what jerry springer seems to believe poor people are screwing each other hitting each other insulting each other and then repeating the process with the same attention to duty the rest of us use when shampooing the plot which covers how a group of stupid people mangle their lives badly enough to provide grist for the jerry springer mill advances solely because of the idiocy of the characters this makes it impossible to care what happens to them it never mattered to me whether they got on the show or what they said or who slept with whom maybe i m not supposed to care about them maybe i m supposed to look at them as some kind of comic type to see their outrageous behavior as inherently funny too bad it isn t the humor is not outrageous it s innocuous it s predictable humor has to have something behind it some kind of painful irony or life experience in order to function scatology is not wit an example a mother catches her daughter and her husband in bed to take revenge she marches across the trailer park and gives oral sex to her daughter s boyfriend since i was over the shock of jerry springer s show a long time ago i had the same reaction i had to andrew dice clay s obscene nursery rhymes not laughter just yawning lastly i found springer s pose as a populist tiresome and unconvincing if he really were an advocate of the poor he would bring on a single mom from bed sty to talk about trying to raise her kids in new york city on a year or failing that he would at least give the participants of his shows a cut of his profits jerry springer gets millions for his shows his movie his book and videos his guests just get round trip air fare hotel accommodations and a chance to humiliate themselves if he liked poor people so much he d give them at least some of the money they earn for him it appears that springer wanted to make this movie to grab some legitimacy for himself jeez with all his fine work you d think he d have earned our respect already anyway the film is weak and boring it doesn t even succeed at being offensive if you want to have a better evening videotape a bug zapper for a night and then watch that
tatie danielle is all about a ghastly old hag who torments her loving and oblivious family out of sheer spite there s a bit of subtext that might be about france s colonial past but it s mostly just danielle doing the sorts of things like deliberately abandoning a small child in a park that would soon have a man picking up his teeth with broken fingers sadly that doesn t happen here it looks good and the acting is fine and there s nothing really wrong with the concept but it s just so smug god does this movie love itself pity it isn t nearly as clever or as funny as it thinks it is the only impetus in the show sorry movie comes from danielle getting nastier and nastier and the only surprise comes from watching the increasingly improbable ways she does this that s right just like in a sitcom which is what this is with the added bonus of delusions of grandeur and a minute running time
absolutely the worst film yet by burton who seems to be getting worse with each film he directs a miserable script loaded with cliches is only the first of many objectionable aspects to this film this is the kind of movie where every time something happens you ll be sure to hear someone shout out he s lost his gun or whatever it is to let everybody know carter is really awful and so is wahlberg who can t play this straight and be convincing very nice effects and photography but poor music in the john williams mold by burton s crony elfman heston appears in a nonsensichal scene to spout out his most famous catch phrases from the first movie very poor results if anyone else out there also saw sleepy hollow they will probably have noticed as i have the declining quality of burton s films i ve heard that this particular project was produced by others and that burton was brought in as director in which case his judgement should be questioned but i think he has allowed any possible vision he might have had earlier in his career to slip the evidence is there in the films in sleepy hollow he couldn t decide what kind of movie he was making whether it was a comedy or a real horror movie and the population of british character actors chris lee etc made you also think it was kind of a monster rally film those are never scary as horror fans know the movie couldn t succeed on either horror or comedy because it was so schizophrenic and no style had been developed to smooth the two together planet of the apes is much the same way and the result comes off more like total recall or tango and cash than like sci fi he s also fallen into the rut of so many other big directors of trying to satisfy the entire possible audience word to burton if you re out there pick something and do it straight or use some style to peice it all together as in mars attacks or beetlejuice or you might as well retire because people like me that are fans of your movies will stop going
this is one very dire production the general consensus has always been that while princess margaret may have been spoilt and pampered and may have revelled in the excess of luxury at her disposal she was a very beautiful young woman here was the production s weakest point the actress failed to get that across it also appeared that the production budget couldn t stretch to a hairdresser from the outset the hair on the princess margaret character had a permanent birds nest in disarray look and looked as if she had been dragged through a bush the actor playing the duke of edinburgh appeared to have prepared for his role by watching rory bremner imitate prince charles and was farcical the production was a flaw ridden clich ridden embarrassing load of rubbish i think all daily mail readers deserve a free dvd copy for christmas
a great concept gone wrong poor acting even worse writing after watching the first two episodes i was wondering why it ever made it to season two the characters are forgettable the writing is poor the sets are just ok the special effects are simply sad so much better has been made in the same time frame where is the money going on this one the first episode starts out interesting then goes downhill fast the precept of the whole show is just silly now don t get me wrong i am a huge sci fi fan and geek but this show simply doesn t cut it as i said in the beginning i am truly surprised it made it to season two so much better has been canceled after only one season jake for example this show was just bad
if you have read the book do not set your hopes high if you have not go read it and never watch the film it is strange to learn that toby young was actually involved a lot in the writing of the script as he claims himself in the post script of the book because the film is very different from the book what the film seems to be aiming at taking a rather thought provoking and entertaining piece that combines philosophical ideas with plain funny sarcasm and simplifying it so that everyone would understand it it achieves with perfection the film is full of bad and cheap jokes suitable for a sitcoms and has lost any meaningful message that it could have had you are better off not seeing it
charles bronson continued his s slump with what could possibly be his worst movie of the decade if not ever in it he plays a detective who goes to great lengths to track down a pimp who has abducted an asian girl and is currently selling her to the highest bidder it s a shameful attempt at action and is quite possibly the most depressing movie ever made a lot of people consider the death wish sequels to be bronson s worst movies the death wish sequels weren t great movies but were in most cases competently made and very watchable kinjite however is an utterly dull thriller which is punctuated by mean spirited racism and child molestation it really is a rephrensible film and all of it is made worse by the fact that it tries to preach a law and justice mentality that is too overwrought to really say anything indeed the movie begins with underage sex being interrupted with bronson then anally raping the pedophile with a dildo the chicago theater i watched this in just gasped at the awkwardness of this scene only to gasp at the awkwardness of the pimp raping the girl in this film it has no point other than to exploit and really the movie wasn t well written enough to rise above the exploitation level and deliver something that would work bronson seems more into things but clearly this is far too repugnant to save i want to point out that i think charles bronson is the coolest actor ever but this effort is ultimately his worst the action sequences are poor also out of awful
i hated this show when i was a kid that was back in the day when kids show characters actually had accents not just the bland generic general american dialect we re used to jack wild had a british accent and pufnstuf s was southern like one of the others mentioned though i never quite understood what the deal was with the witch wanting the flute that always seemed odd to me probably because the flute just annoyed me and i wouldn t have gone to any trouble to take it away just a comment on the similarity of pufnstuf to early s mcdonalds commercials that others have mentioned pufnstuf ripped off mcdonalds at the height of mcdonalds popularity the tv show or rather their creators sought to license mcdonalds characters for their show but when mcdonalds declined the tv show changed the characters slightly and passed it as their own they even hired former employees of mcdonalds ad agency and the voice actors to make the tv shows mcdonalds sued and won search for pufnstuf mcdonaldland lawsuit and you ll find plenty of articles about it
a trio of low life criminals led by matt dillon botches a late night burglary they flee but quickly cross paths with the police who just happen to be in hot pursuit of a terrorist of course the police mistake the burglar gang for the terrorist the real terrorist gets away and the burglars are forced to take refuge in a small dive of a bar taking hostages unaware why the police are so intent on catching them and guess who else has picked the bar as a sanctuary for the night unbelievable absolutely and it goes down hill from there spacey did acquire a good bit of acting talent matt dillon faye dunaway gary sinise viggo mortensen and m emmett walsh but they re all wasted mostly because after all the characters get stuck in the bar all they do for the remainder of the film is argue endlessly and aimlessly long before the conclusion of the film you ve stopped giving a damn about what happens to them
in this strangely lackadaisical apocalypse the world suffers from a dual plague of zombies and vampires but no one seems to be too worried about it in this grade z film which bares less resemblance to sheridan le fanu s famous short novel than my mother s lasagna recipe bored attendants still run gas stations and doctors still make house calls and helpful police officers still show up with radiator fluid just when you need it the plot and i use that term loosely involves a father and a daughter trying to rendevous with the general whose daughter is missing at a church to kill a vampire who very conveniently happens to be traveling with the father and daughter i must confess that a moment or two of genuine humor can be found between vast stretches of unintentional humor the film also boasts just enough nudity to keep a boy of fourteen interested anyone older beware
remembering the dirty particulars of this insidiously vapid movie is akin to digging into your chest cavity with a rusty salted spoon perhaps home alone lost in new york was a bit on the predictable side but this pathetic excuse for a film is just one of the most shameless bids at commercialization i have ever heard of a boy fighting off spies terrorists when he s home alone in a chicago suburb with the chickenpox ridiculous why did this film have to be made i am the kind of person who believes even terrible movies are not wastes of time but rather learning experiences however this is actually a waste of time it should be avoided at all costs
last night i decided to watch the prequel or shall i say the so called prequel to carlito s way carlito s way rise to power which went straight to dvd no wonder it completely and i mean completely s ks waist of time watching it and i think it would be a pure waist of time writing about it i don t understand how de palma agreed on producing this sh t fest of a movie except for only one fact that i tip my hat to jay hernandez who plays the young brigante reminded me how de niro got into the shoes of brando to portray the young don corleone in godfather ii but the difference de niro was amazing and even got an oscar for it jay hernandez well he has guts for trying to be a young pacino too bad for him i don t think he will be playing in film anymore and by the way after i watched this sh ty movie i sat down and watched the original carlitos way to get the bad taste out of my mouth
not that he d care but i m not one of simon pegg s friends if i was there s a good chance we d fallout if he continued to make dross like this the trouble is he found a successful formula as the bumbling ordinary guy next door type in shawn of the dead run fat boy run etc but it s starting to wear thin here his character has no discernible qualities he s rude and obnoxious and thinks he s funny when he frankly isn t when transferred to new york from london and i presume this link is meant to appeal to viewers on both sides of the atlantic he proves equally out of place with his new colleagues still is it any wonder when amongst his jolly japes he hires a transvestite stripper to appear at an editorial meeting an act of revenge for his boss yet somehow kirsten dunst starts to warm to him even though he s done nothing nice oh and because he s a superficial male he falls for megan fox at first sight possibly because her character is as shallow as his it all makes for a predictable film conclusion although i can t see any viewer expressing how this mirrored their life the shame is that on paper this is a cast supposedly worth watching pegg though plays himself kirsten dunst seems to just go though the motions creating no on screen chemistry and megan fox isn t stretched at all the one huge plus is miriam margolyes as pegg s new york landlady now if she had been on screen longer
you know the story pretty kids alone in the woods when bam something starts cutting them up well this crap is no different a bunch of kids return to a cabin where the male leads twin brother disappeared for years before suddenly an unkown creature stars cutting them up and their only help is a doctor biker to say this film was bad is an understatement it s smut the acting was horrible the creature looked very cheesy and as all films do these days they try to get you with a twist ending which they do not there is one bright spot to this film lost star maggie grace as the female lead
i looked over the other comments and was thoroughly amused to find that clearly only people who actually worked on the movie had commented i mean i hate to say bad things about an amateur production but if you make a bad movie and want to comment on it tone it down a little groundbreaking is a little over the top this is a boston based college production that doesn t even achieve the level of most amateur college film it s what you would expect a bunch of kids to do a silly action film without much creativity it s pretty funny if you re willing to poke fun at it not something you will ever see unless you are a student at emerson college
i am a big fan of karishma kapoor and govinda i watched this film after i had seen fiza which was absolutley brilliant there are films that are bad and there are films that are cr p but this film just takes the biscuit we were so annoyed that we were conned out of paying our money expecting a decent film avoid at all cost dont even rent it
there seem to have been any number of films like this released during the s and the fact that i cannot recollect the title to a single one of them off hand is a measure of their impact these are what novelists would call pot boilers they are scarcely more than a vehicle for keeping movie stars in the public eye we have micheal caine peter ustinov omar sharif rex harrison and william holden more than enough names to get bums on cinema seats every taste in hero is catered for though one suspects that most of the audience still went away disappointed their talents are simply thrown away and i wonder that stars with so much money and such reputation can be yet so desperate or lacking in good sense this sort of movie hardly adds gilding to a cv sometimes maybe actors should choose their director instead of the other way round it was pretty obvious that it would be crap even from the outset that ludicrously mismatched jaunty jazz theme music which also percolated up every time some incidental noise is needed had all the atmospheric conviction of elevator muzak who imagined employing a jazz band when a scene depicted the steamy jungles of central africa or the endless sahara with camels and palms as a backdrop definitely a serious goof ball ennio morricone would have known what to do and his results would have oozed enough atmosphere and tension to raise my rating a good two points this director should have taken the trouble to watch lawrence of arabia or even sergio leone s westerns he might have learnt a few things but then again probably he wouldn t alfred hitchcock played the disappearing wife theme to good effect in his film frantic it was later remade with equal panache staring harrison ford in each case the confusion surrounding her loss and the tension of the chase was tangible here when michael caine might be otherwise compelled to employ a little brain and bravado rex harrison kept popping up out of no where like some wily old genii to put him back on track whenever the narrative stumbled at least the photography was rather good with excellent use of the often beautiful environment but then the dumb music must pipe up and blow to atoms what little ambiance this created action scenes were also contrived and stilted with such ineptly choreographed fight sequences that they might have been staged in a first year drama class and of course the players must fight to a jazz accompaniment as you do and that s about as much comment as this item deserves except to say that the script was pretty wretched as well stick with your hobby on this one even if it contained your favourite movie stars you re sure to be disappointed too
i just watched it a couple of laughs but nothing to write home about jason lee looked like he was having fun the long dvd gag reel consists almost solely of him having fits of uncontrollable laughter selma blair seemed to be punching a time clock but then again her character was supposed to be a stick in the mud so well done i guess jim brolin was surprisingly funny being married to babs can t be a picnic the soundtrack was hip and eclectic larry miller who played julia stiles father hilariously in things i hate about you is funny here as well he s great but the best aspect of this movie was the casting of julia stiles i could spend two hours watching her fold laundry and i feel like i just did
unspeakably discombobulated turkey a mix of anti nazi musical pre war americana and agatha christie whodunit spoof with one big big problem it s deadly unfunny besides the single digit i q plot and dialog the most amazing aspect of lady is the berserk casting gene wilder star and co writer tries hard at it all he plays a romantic lead with his looks and his age he and woody allen should start a club for clueless mirrorless ageing comedians and he tries to be moving and funny and poignant and smart and tries to sing and dance and succeeds in none a looong shot from his good old days with mel brooks for a while i thought i was having a myopia fit because everybody in the movie keeps saying cherry jones is this pretty hot chick and that michael cumpsty is this impossibly handsome stallion the guy who plays claire bloom s male secretary is a bespectacled balding thin actor as sexy as a chair and is the object of passion of the two leading ladies mike starr s over the top acting as the most incompetent phoniest cop you ever saw deserves to rank among the most abhorrent performances in recent film history the saddest note is to see wonderful claire bloom and barbara sukowa completely miscast and offensively wasted at least i hope both stars payed their bills back home and subsequently fired their agents with this flop no wonder acting prodigy sukowa returned to germany after she saw what hollywood had in store for her if you want to see how to accomplish a really bad film out of a really bad script with a berserk casting director study this one otherwise stay away
if an auteur gives himself credits before the main title and about more credits before the movie starts and the first shot shows the auteur rolling around on a bed in lycra bike shorts it won t be a surprise to observe that said auteur has the kind of body that should never be seen in spandex the kind of look that might be useful to a homosexual aversion therapist others have given this thing the dishing it deserves for me the most pitiable moment came when the trip from la was signified by a plane landing at what appeared to be lax and the return was signified by a shot of a fedex cargo plane
i can t believe that so much talent can be wasted in one movie the gingerbread man starts of on the right foot and manages to build up some great expectations for the ending but at some point the movie turns into one of the worst stories i ve ever wasted my time on it s just so unbelievably how the bewitched mallory doss manages to pull kenneth branagh s character around by his nose the movies climax is as uninteresting and flat as a beer which has been left out in the sun too long the gingerbread man is probably the worst grisham movie ever and this isn t changed by the fact that talented stars crowd the movie don t waste your time here
this should be re titled the curious case of the unscrupulous filmmakers who misrepresented a non horror snorer as a shock film it s one long boring tale of a fraternity hazing a gag so transparent that even flounder from delta house could see through it jeff east an actor in the dues paying stage can be forgiven for taking any work he could get the same can t be said for charles martin smith who formerly acted for such cinematic heavyweights as george lucas and sam peckinpah once available on tape but thankfully not out on dvd misrepresented garbage like this belongs in a landfill and nowhere else
i ve always been a great fan of woody allen and always will be for most of what he did in the past but only a blind lover could ignore how dull meaningless pretentious and most of all horrendously acted this movie is a vacuous mental masturbation based on inconsistent grounds and what a disastrous idea to artificially recreate a presumed actor allen clone that is putting into will farrell s mouth and gestures what allen would have done in farrell s place had he been years younger the outcome was obviously ludicrous and not to speak of the dialogues what was intended to be philosophical reflections turned into an involuntary mockery of intellectual pondering unaware of its comic effect how sad
houseboat horror is often regarded as the worst australian film ever made and described as a typical slasher film which carried the promotion see the movie that can t get an academy award an underground disco band members begins to die slashed to death by burned maniac as they are attempting to shoot a music video on a remote lake in the australian outback badly acted and written slasher flick with zero suspense and annoying characters it certainly delivers the gore heads are split in half with a machete throats are cut and a woman is killed with a horseshoe if you like cheesy slasher movies you can give this one a try but you have been warned at least it s better than swedish the bleeder out of
i saw this film under the title of tied up in general i have enjoyed dolph s movies so gave this one a try it wasn t worth it i have read some of the previous comments about the box enticing viewers don t be fooled this is a poor film at best the acting is nonexistent the plot what little there is of one is very predictable the movie in places seems to be chopped together this one just plain stinks the place up not even worth the price of a cheap night rental as a bit of a dolph fan i kept waiting to see him in action by the end of the movie you will still be waiting best to avoid this film and spend your time watching almost anything else
if you like a syfi soap opera this show is for you as fare as i am concerned it does not work for me and after watching episodes i just can t watch it anymore it is boring and slow and for a show that the timeline is based around years ago if you base it on battlestar galactica s timeline for arriving on earth they sure seem to have all the same stuff around like the year old chevy vans driving down the streets and people watching the year old popular name brand lcd t v sets it also goes the same with the rest of the sets as well on the show there is just to much of today s stuff involved in it to not overlook i think they could have done a lot better of a job to get around these issues and yes battlestar galactica had some of the same issues but not nearly as bad as fare as the rest of the show it is not nearly as good as bsg was and it is a poor pre sequel to it
the longer this film went on and it seemed to tediously go on for ever the more annoyed i became as quite frankly what a waste of time sitting through this total nonsense how on earth do people get to make films like this or indeed receive finance for such rubbish don t be fooled by the relatively high ratings on imdb as it just proves you can fool some of the people all the time and in this picture the main players have an obsession with guns so it is not difficult to work out the way this movie will ultimately unfold america can never understand that the rest of the world finds it bizarre how society in the usa has such an obscene and fatal gun culture anyhow the lead actor portrays a loser who escapes into a fantasy world of being a cowboy in an urban sprawl he comes across a family with two spoiled brat children a teenage girl and boy taken care of by a strict single parent father who can barely cope the cowboy is seduced by the teenage girl or vice versa and the impressionable boy is seemingly taken in by the lunacy of the loser the cowboy spends the whole time in a state of unreality and depression a total loser who prefers to go to the beach then work for living and then commits a burglary on his family as he is too lazy to make money legally ask yourself who wants to watch either a sad failed loser in a fantasy world holding a death wish or indeed view a poor family who are in effect not much better than white trash this film is pointless drivel it only saves itself from getting the lowest mark possible by some half listen able music
it s the same old if i can t get the funding for my project i ll inject myself monster movie there is nothing new here it s a lot like the jeff goldblum fly movie the man manages to keep some semblance of sanity but eventually succumbs to the effects of his experiments the acting is pretty bad there are people acting stupidly all along the way putting their lives in danger for no apparent reason the guy keeps going back to the lab he has been forbidden to enter then there s his relationship with a young woman and her son admittedly he is good looking but he seems like a lot of trouble it s just a pretty big waste of time even his tyrannosaurus suit looks like it came off the rack at a star trek convention
the cowboys could leave you a little sore in the saddle definitely not one of johns best movies don t get me wrong with any john wayne move there is always some good spots and this one has it s fair share but over all the picture moves slow and just doesn t live up to the aspirations it could have been bruce dern again does an outstanding job as the villain roscoe lee brown is another bright spot in the movie the kids in the movie were average but could have been cast better this would be a good movie for the eight to fifteen year old movie goers this would be a good family move to watch with your children just be aware there is a couple of scenes that you may want to take a look at before you let the young ones see it but most kids that i know who have seen the movie like it maybe it s because they get to see kids their age do all the grown up work
i guess you have to give some points for the sheer courage of writing a musical around a history lesson but how about some decent music is the cartoonish acting of howard desilva meant to pique the interest of otherwise jaded children is william daniels campy contemporary for the time acting style meant to appeal to a s s demographic do we need all the in jokes about ny nj i can hear the blue haired broadway audience guffawing on cue sorry i find the whole piece dated boring the acting far too strident for the screen
rois et reine is a sprawling mess of a movie which will probably irritate as many viewers as it delights it focuses by turns on ex lovers nora emanuelle devos and ismael mathieu amalric as they each confront a major crisis in their now separate lives while nora s story is played straight and is sombre in tone ismael s is played mainly for laughs although it s not particularly funny nora s crisis is triggered by the terminal illness of her father louis maurice garrel and ismael s by his sudden incarceration in a mental hospital at the instigation of a mysterious third party ismael and louis are just two of the males who have shaped nora s life and in turn have been shaped by her the most notable others being her now deceased first lover pierre and their young son elias as events past and present are played out for the audience and the ex lovers become involved in each other s lives once more it gradually emerges that nora s personal take on her life story may be less reliable than first meets the eye cult director arnaud desplechin has fashioned a considerable oddity here one which has garnered major plaudits in france he wilfully eschews established narrative convention and develops the movie via a series of dramatic shifts in mood and tone had this approach been founded on a coherent unifying core idea or theme it might have worked but it s not clear in the end what exactly desplechin s film is actually about heavy handed allusions to greek mythology and freudian theory are evidently freighted with meaning but at least for this unschooled movie goer remain less than helpful in illuminating and interpreting the lives of the characters at other times the treatment lapses into kitsch but the use of the anodyne moon river as the film s theme tune suggests this is probably deliberate spoiler alert i suspect a major theme of the movie is the not very original observation that how we see ourselves can differ radically from how others see us or even how we think others see us this idea is most obviously represented in the film by the violent death of pierre and the revelation contained in louis secret diary but unfortunately both events seem entirely disconnected from what has otherwise been revealed to the audience of pierre and louis respective relationships with nora this seems a cheat on desplechin s part as if he is thrusting the idea upon us in unmediated form rather than illustrating it more subtly in the natural course of the narrative one or two darkly surreal touches imply the presence of an alternative but largely unconscious world of persons stripped frighteningly bare but again these are felt more as pretentious intrusions of film making technique rather than eruptions from a deeper reservoir of truth inherent in the story in fact for all its heavy handed hints at depth the characters are curiously undeveloped and unnuanced as if they function more as ciphers for their creator s many ideas about people rather than as real people in their own right much of the detail of their lives seems arbitrarily applied rather than organic for example ismael as we are constantly reminded is a viola player but more than two hours pass before we actually see or hear him play and the effect of his chosen instrument or profession upon his personality is never elaborated hence he may just as well be a marine biologist or a trapeze artist amalric brings a certain manic charm to the unhinged but ultimately sane ismael but i found devos cloying and monotone which may be intentional however as the elusive nora meanwhile jean paul roussillon as ismael s father elsa wolliaston as his psychoanalyst and magalie woch as the psychically wounded but defiant sinologist he befriends in hospital make the biggest impact amongst the supporting actors catherine deneuve s in it too though her role is little more than a self referential cameo ultimately rois et reine is very much an acquired taste should it fail to push your buttons it s very likely that desplechin s undisciplined and florid approach will frustrate and exasperate even as you somehow keep watching
this series gets stars solely because it puts some of dickens bleak house on film and perhaps someone will read the book contrary to what is probably received opinion diana rigg was poor as lady dedlock she was clunky and wooden lady d is a reserved character but not a martinet denholm elliot is wrong wrong wrong for mr jarndyce so i ll interrupt myself and respond to all those people who are saying i didn t read the book so i don t have to take this guy s opinion because he s basing his evaluations on the book true and not true for ex diana rigg is bad in her role because of poor acting whether or not you ve read the book on the other hand denholm elliot is a passable jarndyce although too old the series fails not because it s unfair to compare it to the book but because the various plot lines and characters just don t coalesce to make a coherent dramatic mysterious andcompelling entertainment it is dull and flat if you want to make apossibly good bleak house you need to expend hours of film in two hour episodes but i suggest that producers etc leave dickens alone even a christmas carol television deadens the genius of dickens as manifested in his ingenious plots and unforgettable characters
what a time we live in when someone like this joe swan whatever the hell is considered a good filmmaker or even a filmmaker at all where are the new crop of filmmakers with brains and talent we need them bad and to hell with mumblecore this movie is about nothing just as the characters in the film stand for nothing it s this horrible so called gen y that is full of bored idiots some of which declare themselves filmmakers with out bothering to learn anything about the craft before shooting well orson welles was a filmmaker john huston was a filmmaker fellini was a filmmaker dreyer was a filmmaker etc current films like these show just how stupid young so called filmmakers can be when they believe going out with no script no direction no thought no legit camerawork everything shot horribly on dv no craft of editing no nothing stands for rebellious or advanced film making nope it s called ignorance and laziness or just pure masturbation of cinema and there actually is an in your face jack off shot so be ready look at the early films of any accomplished indie filmmaker linklatter morris allen lynch hartley jarmusch jost lee or herzog none made anything as tedious and aimless as this yet swan whatever the hell is still going to sxsw every year and hailed as some kind of gutsy new talent it s crap i can t imagine anyone liking this and everything else this so called filmmaker has done all seen by me is just as bad the newer stuff clearly made to appeal to a more mainstream audience one of the sitcom calling steer clear unless you re a friend or family member of those involved on second thought if you re a family member or friend you d probably be embarrassed to see a family member or friend in such compromising situations utter garbage this isn t art this is the ultimate opposite of it
just the fact that the cover is a drawing like those old b movies should give you a warning about the quality of this movie this is however not a b movie it is a d movie there are no known actors and the animals wow it is the worst data animation ever made during the last two decades you hardly ever see the scaaary sabretooth shown on the front cover you just hear people scream bleed and die and you occasionally see a teeth or a tiger paw it s so amateur maybee worth seeing just because it s so bad give it to a friend and say this is the best movie i have ever seen and wait for their reaction he he the movie is to weak to give it a spoiler alert this is a spoiler
i was disappointed the film was a bit predictable and did not live up to the hype plastered all over the box having said that the characters were well developed the windego myth was used in a unique premise and the house was pretty spooky but it just missed for me i kept waiting for that big ahhhhh or boo but it never came furthermore the movie was plagued with poor filming of poor special effects thus showing to much of a bad thing and not using atmosphere and viewer imagination to create the horror and suspense try movies like session or the cube if your looking for a low budget but well conceived horror movie
i wasn t sure how to rate this movie since it was so bad it was actually very funny i m not a gackt fan by any means though he is talented despite the weird pseudonym that sounds like a cat coughing up a hairball i always thought hyde was talented though faith is an interesting album but on topic here folks this movie is ridiculous it s so over the top and nonsensical it s almost like a parody of supernatural action films the movie has almost no plot here except it s just about vampires with gangster friends in a way this film almost reminded me of spider man with how there were too many ideas which resulted in not enough time to pay attention on one of them the action scenes were laughable quickly edited almost hard to understand with choreography that s so laughably bad though hyde looked very stylish during the action scenes but that s this film s only such redemption i m a sucker for good action movies but the action was horribly done though the final shootout was ok and the highlight of this otherwise depressing movie it keeps jumping between genres not a good thing it wants to be a drama or an action flick or a horror or a romance what the hell if this review is making you mad why is it because gackt and hyde are your love don t fool yourself this movie is bad
for romantic comedies i often judge the quality of the film based upon the mistiness of my eyes by the end of the experience unfortunately for the wedding date i can only rate the film with out of possible tears my apologies to fans of debra messing and dermot mulroney but i did not see much chemistry between their two characters the premise of the film is a reverse pretty woman with dermot playing the role of nick a high priced male escort hired by debra s character kat to accompany her to england for her sister s wedding a romantic relationship presumably develops between patron and client but the dialogue seemed forced and artificial and there weren t enough romantic sparks flying in the relationship of nick and kat in a supporting role amy adams was a standout as kat s sister whenever amy came on screen she served as a spark plug and catalyst for the film s energy perhaps if amy adams had been cast in the role of kat the film might have had more dynamism but as it turned out instead of reaching for kleenex i was looking for the visine in attempt to at least pretend that this film had some genuine sentiment and romance
this film is one giant pant load paul schrader is utterly lost in his own bad screenplay and his directing is about as comatose as it can be without his actually having been sleepwalking during the process the worst though is woody harrelson whom i ordinarily like when he s properly cast he plays the walker a homosexual man in d c who plays social companion to the bored wives of the washington elite he couldn t have been more one dimensional if he had been cut out of a magazine and bounced around in front of the camera on a popsicle stick his southern accent is that off the rack version that decrescendos from the beginning to the end of every line he delivers as though the heat and humidity of the south is still draining him of every ounce of energy he has it is monotonous but his is not the worst accent in the movie his boyfriend played by moritz bleibtreau attempts to affect some kind of a mid east accent that is so clumsy he can barely deliver the bad lines written for him he is incapable of rolling his r s in spite of the fact that in real life he is german and speaks several languages one of them being italian that s kind of a good reason to cast someone else don t ya think from the story to the screenplay to the directing to the camera work to the performances by the leads this movie is bad from beginning to end the only tolerable moments in this film came from three supporting actresses lily tomlin lauren bacall and kristin scott thomas only these three managed to make it through this movie with their dignity in tact in fact all three are excellent in spite of being trapped in a really bad film ufortunately no one could ever be good enough to redeem this endless series of flaws if you like these three actresses watch them in something else this movie is not worth your time
i awake suddenly aware that i m drooling onto the plastic couch cover and realize it s a warm saturday afternoon why was i sleeping did i hit my head or accidentally swallow all of my grandma s muscle relaxers could it be adult onset narcolepsy no i momentarily paused on cheap seats while channel surfing and the stunning lack of humor and talent drained my life force with such speed that i blacked out it s that head shaking mouth agape shoulder shrugging bad but i have to give these moronic and boring twins credit for selling this idea through perhaps they had the same effect on the espn programming executive that they had on me and when he she woke up a few horrendous episodes were already in the can and he she hoped that since all the viewers will be asleep no one will now how awful it is and he she can keep the annual salary you ve been warned
i m sorry but this is just plain pathetic the little girl was a brat their were no enjoyable characters and the plot sucked besides it wasn t even a gator as the film would like us to believe if you check out any complete guide to reptiles you will find that it really is a crocodile not a gator obviously they didn t hire a real animal expert or they would know that the creature is a croc it is a sad excuse for a movie especially the ending i nearly fell asleep with this one
antonioni s movies have aged not well what always surprised me about them is that besides an unquestionable plastic beauty there is a dull and didactic psychology of the characters and situations remember for instance the conversations between mastroianni and the wicked capitalistic that wants sing up him in la notte or monica vitti laughing at the peasants flirting in the train in la aventura or ferzetti dropping the glass of ink at the end of the same film i have reviewed yesterday zabriskie point in this film there are a lot of nice and elaborate shots of the rod taylor office the streets and highways of l a the publicity advertisements the deserts etc that show the fascination of the author in his american journey in the same way than wim wenders years later unfortunately there are too a lot of hippie leftist clich s that spoil the movie the boy leaves the meeting steals an aeroplane and flies over the desert in order to liberate himself and find something different the executives in grey suites speak all the time about speculation the girl looks at the object women in the swimming pool and leaves because she wants not to be like them the couple of fat middle class in the caravan speak in front of the beauty of the nature of building a hotel and earning a lot of money last but not the least a lot of couples making love in the desert what a hippie platitude sorry today half a century after the revolution of la aventura we can see that the king is naked and his films except le amiche and perhaps il grido are only a handful of aestheticism and commonplaces
comes this heartwarming tale of hope hope that you ll never have to endure anything this awful again cough razzie award cough i disliked this movie because it was unfunny predictable and inane while watching i felt like i was in a psychology experiment to determine how low movie standards could get before people complained when i requested my money back at the end of the movie i was informed that because i watched the whole thing i wasn t entitled to reimbursement i was told by the assistant manager that several people had complained and gotten refunds already though the movie summary is pretty basic the midget thief steals a diamond and the poses as a baby to elude police underneath this clever outline however lies a repertoire of original fresh and hilarious skits or not ask yourself the following do you like to see people getting hit by pans do you like fart jokes do you like to see midgets posing as babies threatened with a thermometer in the anus do you like tired racial jokes do you think babies say goo goo goo goo goo gaa gaa do you drool if you answered yes to any of the above then this movie is definitely for you although it has been billed in some places as the worst movie of the decade there is probably a movie or that are worse somewhere i can t say for sure i gave this movie stars because we all know a review with only one star would indicate bias on the part of the reviewer and then the review wouldn t be taken seriously this lowbrow comedy is intended for a less intelligent audience and i cannot in good conscience recommend it to anyone save your money for something funny respect
this is a film that belongs firmly to the s very surprising that american film institute has chosen this one for one for the best american movies of all time i have seen practically all of the movies on that list and this one is by far the most disappointing one of those musical numbers and there many many of them are very overlong and boring and have absolute no connection with the story the end of the movie has horribly over long ballet sequency which naturally has no real relation to the story of the movie it must be admitted that it is very well made the music is ok and the dancing done with the highest professional standard but there is no real reason why the sequence is included in the movie the main character of the movie is extremely childlish and unlikeable and behaves in unpolite way his mental age is about if you want to see a good musical made on the golden age of musicals go and see singing in the rain
this has to be one of the worst movies ever made the plot looked intriguing like that of passenger but with the latter movie it somehow worked a lot better the plot has been worked out in the worst possible way just a few of the awful moments in the movie a flight attendant is standing in the opened doorway of a flying and trying to close the door without being sucked out by the mile per hour winds thereafter the lands the aircraft from a few miles out starting at feet thats impossible even for pilots with thousands of hour experience when on the runway perfectly straight of course she is instructed to pull on the flaps huh come on flaps are there to ensure lift at low speeds when on the runway you use thrust reverse on the engines and give maximum power i can go on and on about little and mostly big mistakes in the movie but then my reply would become the size of the english dictionary this is a movie you want to miss take my word for it
there is simply no use in trying to glorify any part of this film it was straight up trash at the very beginning you might think that you are in for a visually stunning piece of cinematography and then shortly thereafter you are hit with a large sack burlap of fail the fighting is barely martial the acting is teetering on the edge of par and the music is not worth describing there is only enough of a story to have created an excuse for this film to have been made the decisions that the characters make and the way that they deal with the situations is weak and did nothing but frustrate me i think that the only reason this film came about was to act as a bit of fan service by using yumiko shaku
i saw the movie late one night on cable and could not believe how bad it was i usually enjoy bad movies but this one was so revolting that it wasn t even entertaining some of the highlights of this film include the absurd music which is constantly playing throughout the movie the hideous special effects when someone is shot with a laser gun they turn neon green and promptly disintegrate and the disgusting acting the acting in fact is what i feel steals the show i didn t recognize any of the actors in the movie and i hope that i never have to see any of them again overall i recommend renting this movie if you can find it i can t imagine a video store carrying this garbage just so that you can learn to appreciate quality films after seeing this trash
when you go at an open air cinema under the greek summer night you usually don t care what the movie is edison started really good with some good effort from the singers who want to be actors and a once again great morgan freeman but in a movie there is usually a good start to catch audience done a bit boring yet story filling middle of the movie that is more about characters and less about action done and the third part is something really good so that you can remember the movie when you see elite police officers packed with weapons that can demolish a building shoot at a guy behind a car fail to hit him even once while he kills all but and then the guy takes out a flame thrower to kill the rest you realise that the greek summer sky filled with stars is way too good to be distracted by a movie like this
i was subjected to this atrocity by my wife tried to turn it off after minutes but was forced through the whole thing this must be hands down the most gruesome pretense of a movie ever there were great script moments such as sammy if she gets over here right away she gets a bonus madam a boner sammy no a bonus to summarize horrible script terrible acting and incredibly illogical
pretty crazy whodunit featuring an all black cast trying to figure out who murdered the philandering trumpet player who was just about to go to hollywood to make it big was it his wife his girlfriend his would be girlfriend her father his butler the newspaper guy who knows and who cares the result of this is just a little underwhelming and the actors here don t really get me in a mood to care one way or another finding out why snake venom as a weapon who knows who cares the music in this is alright but there s little of it and most of it is pretty let s get this over with this isn t worthy of your time there are better all black casted movies out there
debbie reynolds toe taps tangos and yes tap dances her way through this ordinary thriller which has a distinctly fabricated s atmosphere two ladies brought together when their sons commit a murder try starting their lives over by running a tap dance school for tots in hollywood trouble is one of them is plagued by neuroses can you imagine this thing years earlier with robert aldrich directing bette davis and joan crawford nahh bette never would have allowed joan so much screen time to strut her stuff and i can t imagine bette davis in the other role tap dancing her heart out this is a purely bogus piece of macabre written by a slumming henry farrell whose idea of a good shock is to stage the mass murder of a group of rabbits not an ounce of honest fun in the whole tepid package from
amateurish in the extreme camera work especially overwrought documentary camera operators needn t spin around all the time the script is truly inane and the acting is even worse on top of that the story is disjointed and meandering with some gaping holes in logic at one point the lead wishes to get thrown in jail in order to rub shoulders with suspected al quada operatives and thus get an interview with osama i found the story entirely unbelievable as a result of so many flaws the filmmaker lead role really portrays a rash idiot frat boy the only item of interest really is that the filmmakers did in fact film on location it s truly a shame they wasted their opportunity to make something interesting who financed this crap
while i recently gave operation petticoat a positive review i really didn t like this film even though it had so many similarities both were made just a few years apart both starred cary grant and both were wwii comedies however the overall tone and style of the films were quite different kiss her for me overall just seemed like a cheaper film with poor writing little energy and some very broad performances even when compared to operation petticoat i think that at least much of the blame for this lies in casting jayne mansfield the combination of her ample talents and limited acting ability really made this a budget film look like it came from a rd rate studio plus there wasn t much chemistry or energy in pairing her with cary grant an actor generally loved for his grace and class it s sort of like pairing sir lawrence olivier with marjorie main
the premise while not quite ludicrous was definitely ridiculous what should have occurred by the second encounter with tritter was that tritter should simply be wasted house hires some guy and de physicalizes tritter in real life tritter would have been hauled up for harassment the rectal thermometer episode would have been exposed in court providing motive and opportunity and the hospitals lawyers would have made mincemeat out of tritter and the particular department he worked for he would be in prison as would anyone complicit in the harassment of house chase foreman cameron wilson and cuddy the lawsuit would have won house a tasty settlement enough to keep him supplied with vicadin well into his old age while tritter would wind up somewhere driving a cab trying to rehabilitate himself by doing good for people for two years before people tumbled to the fact that they d seen it all before
not sure why this film was advertised as a wild quirky laugh filled comedy there is not much in this movie that will entertain nor amuse the moviegoer annette bening whose acting was touted as being oscar worthy comes off here as mannered with her performance seeming routine brian cox s character is confusing and irritating and the lead playing augusten joseph cross appears to simply not have the personality to carry his role the best thing about the film is evan rachel wood but she is not enough to endorse this boring unsavory film the film disappeared quickly and it seems with good reason i found some of the scenes distasteful the scene with brian cox and his just utilized toilet rivals some of the worst scenes in you and me and everyone we know and the squid and the whale some embarrassing and most of them unsettling i found the whole experience a waste of time don t you waste your time
sorry everyone i know this is supposed to be an art film but wow they should have handed out guns at the screening so people could blow their brains out and not watch although the scene design and photographic direction was excellent this story is too painful to watch the absence of a sound track was brutal the loooonnnnng shots were too long how long can you watch two people just sitting there and talking especially when the dialogue is two people complaining i really had a hard time just getting through this film the performances were excellent but how much of that dark sombre uninspired stuff can you take the only thing i liked was maureen stapleton and her red dress and dancing scene otherwise this was a ripoff of bergman and i m no fan f his either i think anyone who says they enjoyed hours of this is well lying
me and a group of friends rent horrible videos to laugh at them trust me it has lead to some horribly spent money but also some great laughs s i c k is one of the better horror but funny movie we ve rented the plot is over done the whole take your friends into the woods and never return thing is very old the goriest part of the movie looks like your visiting the local butcher shop except a little dirtier and with blood on the play dough looking meat and if anyone has ever been scared of this movie at any time they should stick to cartoon network for the rest of their life it s pathetic the good aspects of the movie are that the two girls in it are reasonably hot one better then the other and you see them both naked during the movie the other good aspect is that this movie is so bad at times that you will laugh till you cry i don t like watching horrible acting or renting these horrible videos i don t find that fun but seeing the amount of effort these people put into it and still come out so bad is hilarious and worth renting unless you are too mature to laugh at someone s downfalls i would recommend it if your renting buying it to laugh at it i d give it an
hallam foe tells us the story about a boy who lost his mother and experiences some sort of oedepus complex afterward it is something like minutes long but would be better in ten there s like an hour in the middle where he is doing climbing practice on rooftops and habits in a church tower like quasimodo only he is much less sympathetic there s a strange love story involved which doesn t have anything to do with anything she happens to look like his mother yes so what we know he misses his mother that s what the first ten minutes were about they should just have put the beginning and ending together and it would have been a o k short film now it s a portrait of a character who doesn t change he is a guy that stuff happens to the only active choice he has in the whole middle of the movie is to apply for a job there s this whole oedepus thing going on which is supposed to make us analyze his character he paints his face dresses in women s clothing and wears a dead badger on his head a badger you ve got to see the ending he returns to his home with the badger on his head and it is shot like a tacky horror film to kill his dad s new wife which he had sex with in the beginning and somehow they thought this wouldn t be entertaining enough so they put some indie punk music in the background i ve got to admit though i m kind of allergic to films that want to write a psychological complex on your nose it feels like this mackenzie director guy whatever is trying to show us that he also has been studying psychology in school you are so smart thank you for bringing all these forgotten theories back into our memories you really dug what a wallraff okay so now i realized this film is based on some random book but anyway photowise it is boring a lot of talking heads plus the editor has changed the colors from scene to scene you know cold and warm etc why maybe hallam foe is both a feature and a test film for color blind people or maybe they just thought that the drama wouldn t be enough to tell us that he feels lonely so they increased blue so that we really get it i m not even gonna comment on the clich indie oh how how how cute drawings they have made in the presentation and all the cute sex stuff going on this whole film is an independent clich but i do recommend it i laughed more than a few times though it is really annoying to be a film student and to see how crap like this gets through the machine
this can be one of the most enjoyable movies ever if you don t take it seriously it is a bit dated and the effects are lame but it is so enjoyable there are giant crabs that attack a girl oh and the crabs sing japanese it is amazingly bad and the ending which has been telegraphed throughout the entire film is hideously awesome predictable but seeing the final fight will leave you rolling in your seat don t even give this film a chance and you will love it susan george is fun to watch and yes she does appear naked her daughter isn t quite worth putting up with but she does get attacked by giant crabs they are the size of large cats this is a but i love it as a movie my god but for entertainment i give it a did i mention there are giant crabs
with that line starts one silly boring british sci fi film the great vorelli from the movie devil doll builds a teleportation machine only to have his funding cut off by blanchard a bearded man who has a thing for bow ties and men with large eye brows when his experiment fails the good doctor learns that lembach the man who controls all of the grants in the world will be staying in london for a few days he attempts to project himself into the house of blanchard with the help of his comely lab assistant sheila needless to say something goes wrong and he winds up looking like a rat the rest of the movie is devoted to the good orange haired doctor walking around london shocking people with his mutated hand and wearing a diaper on his face there are some more killings some modest paper work and finally the doctor vanishes to where ever rat faced doctors go thankfully no one decided to make a sequel
the silent one panel cartoon henry comes to fleischer studios billed as the world s funniest human in this dull little cartoon betty long past her prime thanks to the production code is running a pet shop and leaves henry in charge for far too long five minutes a bore
this movie is a mess i m surprised it even has a theatrical release without robin williams it would have gone straight to video it is poorly written it is poorly directed it s worse offense is that it has taken an interesting topic and reduced it to a ridiculous and boring thriller that has no thrills and no suspense and no inner or emotional logic especially after the first half hour the movie dovetails into a series of ridiculous set pieces that are so over the top that the audience i saw it with was laughing at it save your money the trailer is totally misleading it is not suspenseful and there are no thrills in fact the movie s truly worst offense is that it is simply boring
i fail to see the appeal of this series which is supposed to be sci fi it s really just let s see what soap operatically happens this week and oh the cylons are involved through flashbacks the cylon babe that keeps nailing the other guy is pretty lame it s pretty obvious that t a was added to the show every time she pops up i m bewildered as to wtf is supposed to be going on and don t even try to bullsh t me about story arcs it s a soap opera with some cgi thrown in this is not science fiction aside from the original premise this series is not everything it s worked up to be if you like trendy edgy dodgy jumpy vague editor on crack camera work this show might be for you since nerds seem to be raving about this show it s a clear indication that vocal nerds opinions have been changed from picard s tng
fans of creature feature films have to endure a lot of awful movies lately blood surf shamelessly joins the list of stupid redundant pulp horror titles about ridiculously big animals that want to turn the food chain upside down crocodiles are particularly successful as we already had to struggle our way through the abysmal crocodile directed by a disappointing tobe hooper and lake placid blood surf is every bit as bad as these other films and on top of that it likes to exaggerate tremendously the saltwater crocodile supposedly is years old over ft long and it kills for fun during the film he amuses himself by devouring a bunch of utterly stupid surfer dudes dudettes who came to seek new thrills by surfing in a shark congested area the only beautiful aspect about this film is the tropical location even though it s a completely inappropriate setting for a film like this the lagoons and nature looks marvelous every other aspect is simply disastrous there s a quite a bit of gore but it all looks fake and laughable the dialogues are downright painful to listen to you won t believe some of the lines these actors have to say i know surfers are supposed to be a mentally underdeveloped group but i hope for their own sake they re not that stupid early in the film one of the characters refers to jaws as being a mechanical toy but the croc here looks at least times less real than spielberg s great white shark the visual effects in blood surf are amateurish and the massacres fail to impress i won t say too much about the acting since it s secondary in flicks like this the girls look sexy in wet shirts and their boobs joyfully bounce while running away from the beast you guessed right blood surf is a very bad film so bad it becomes fun again but funny for a whole other reason than james hickox intended
this kid is rather bad but in no way do they make him the type that outsmarts adults and can foil experienced thieves at every turn no he is not so much a brat as he is a kid with severe emotional problems a nice couple looking to adopt get rather suckered into adopting him and while the husband is a bit more willing to give this kid a chance the mother is not through in a bizarre michael richards character and the always annoying gilbert gottfried and you have yourself a rather bad movie with a few laughs in it here and there i actually prefer the sequel to this film as i like the fact they brought amy yasbeck back as a different more likable character as there are one to many characters in this film that are thoroughly unlikable as it is even the kid is rather annoying at first in this one and they kind of chill him out in the sequel too the plot is simple enough though as the prospective parents go to adopt this kid that they think is great by the way the orphanage is throwing a party as they depart they soon realize they have themselves a little hellion add to that this little hellion getting into contact with a convict of some sort not sure about this character at first i thought it was supposed to be his real father or something not all that good but i will pick this ahead of that culkin kid any day of the week
i have been waiting for this movie a long time especially because juhi chawla is in this she s a great actress this movie contains six stories it s a new concept flew over from hollywood so it s not a new item khamini priyanka chopra is a dancer she wants to get famous and makes up a boyfriend to let news reporters be interested in her but then rahul salman khan appears and he claims to be her boyfriend priyanka chopra is still not a good actress when she yells i get annoyed salman khan cannot play comic roles but in his serious parts he is marvelous vinay anil kapoor is married to seema juhi chawla he gets in a midlife crisis and gets attracted to a much younger woman with forgetting what he really has in life his wife and kids anil kapoor en juhi are natural born actors actresses they are great but this story is to thin for them shiven akshaye khanna is going to get married to gia ayesha takia but he gets cold feet and blows the wedding off ashutosh joh abraham is married to tehzeeb vidya balan she gets an accident and suffers a memory loss now she doesn t know that she loves her husband anymore raju govinda is a cab driver he meets stephani shannon esrechowitz who is a white woman who is in love with an indian male but he is about to get married with an indian woman raju has to bring staphani to that man but falls in love with her i never liked govinda s movies he is very annoying not funny but in this movie i liked him very much like he has been growing up the last years oh yes there is sohail khan he plays ram dayal who is just married to phoolwati isha koppikar he want to get some serious action with her but every time her family comes in between sohail khan is not a handsome actor but he is funny i like his movies now here s the problem all these stories aren t interesting to make one story from six not interesting stories does not make the whole movie interesting here and there the stories touch each other but is not significant for the characters my conclusion priyanka cannot act loose that woman in the bollywood industry sohail khan should make more movies this role for him was too small salman khan cannot act comic roles but real serious movies that s written on his life as an actor this movie sucks and is a waste of a cast of good actors and actresses like anil kapoor juhi chawla akshaya khanna and john abraham it s just like you have the ability to make a movie with amitabh bachchan and you only let him sing a lullaby
everyone does things that they later regret things that they wish they could blame on drugs or alien possession things that although seem rational at the time later reveal themselves to be engraved invitations for suffering and endless recriminations of stupidity for some people it is signing the note for the new hummer for others it is picking up a homicidal hitchhiker for still others it is sending their bank account information to third world millionaires mysteriously strapped for cash for me it was a film d war dragon wars in hindsight i should have guessed how environmentally friendly and thoroughly recycled this movie would turn out to be from its stuttered and repeating title but with my willing suspension of disbelief intact and a naive faith stemming from the cool looking poster in the lobby i really wanted this film to work sadly by the time the old man in the pawnshop explained the entire backstory fifteen minutes into the picture i had the sudden sinking revelation that comes from knowing every plot point of a still unseen film and worse i knew just how badly every point would all suck let me be perfectly clear here the english language lacks sufficient nuance and depth in the field of ultimate evil to properly describe just how bad this film really is as for knowing all the twists of movie i was wrong in the spirit of the old godzilla films whose scales this one is not worthy to fill it conveniently sprouted extra sub plots every time the main characters were threatened by the specter of meaningful dialogue it was infested with close calls miraculous escapes and concentrated deposits of poorly explained angst this film is what would happen if you gave the produces of the mighty morphing power rangers access to the national defense budget and lots of liquor let me try to explain imagine you could get a hold of all the coolest looking set pieces from successful action movies of the last decade first take the rasta talking army of amphibians from star wars episode one and remove their prozac until they are ready to club navy seals next take close approximations of kira knightly and tom cruise you can even call him ethan as a subtle nod to the mission impossible franchise and give them lots of film noir narration so no one get confused while trying to follow the wading pool depths of their thoughts finally add a raspy voiced villain in pointy armor worthy of a lord of the rings yardsale and a couple of giant cobras angry at having their scenes deleted from latest edition of king kong and lay them all out in no particular order in modern day los angeles now run to the drugstore to find something for your sudden migraine when you return puree these ingredients until any overlooked hint of originality is dissolved into a homogenized mass of cheese and serve semi gelatinous at several points during this picture i found myself saying out loud make the bad movie stop and breaking into tears to call this a b movie would be giving it an undeserved promotion after summer school and a lot of physical therapy it might possibly pass for a c level film if you could somehow sleep through most of it in short if you ever find yourself with money and brain cells to burn and the need to punish yourself for hideous unspoken sins against humanity dragon wars might just be the film for you
the majority of stephen king s short stories are little gems with original ideas that don t take a long time to develop basically lean and mean he sets them up quickly in a scarce number of pages you read em and you re finished before you know you ve begun they re like the equivalent of a carton of mcdonald s fries they taste really good and you know there s not much nutritional value in them re from a literary standpoint they don t say much about the universal human condition but you re still gonna scarf em down just don t be a pig and go for the extra super sized portion and fill up on too much grease too much grease is a metaphor for the prose in king s novels when find yourself reading one of them and saying come on enough with the pop cultural observations or clever yankee asides get on with the story already he has compiled four books of short story collections i ve read them all from nightshift to the latest everything s eventual and they all display an efficiency of getting to the point which is sometimes sorely lacking in his tome sized novels but his short stories never overstay their welcome which brings us to the tv adaptations of nightmares and dreamscapes how in the hell did they the series producers get a green light to turn stories that usually averaged pages into minute episodes i ll tell you how two words stephen king stories with his name on them probably didn t come cheap and one hour shows enable more advertising than half hour ones so what should have been an anthology of mostly or minute episodes is turned into double that length and double the commercial time ka ching i m not going to waste time synopsizing the plots of these stories this review supposes you have already read the stories and or seen the show what follows is merely my gut reactions to what tnt presented of the four installments so far here s my ten cent assessment from first to worst battleground not a classic by any means but hey how could anyone argue with keeping william hurt from opening his trap by filming this episode without a single line of dialog and the tongue in cheek reference and destruction of the killer zuni doll from trilogy of terror proved to me the producers and the writer of the teleplay who is richard matheson s son the writer of tot knew their mission with this one was to make the action deadly yet at the same time fun it took longer to get to hurt s apartment than it should have but i think it fulfilled it s objective umney s last case liked this one primarily because of william h macy s performance i think the writer umney should have appeared in the story sooner into the private eye umney beginning because he was the actual reality of the story and anyone familiar with the king short story probably half if not more of the audience knew the chandleresque set up was due to get interrupted by the writer s reality so let s get on with it already and cut out the cute and clever hard boiled repartee private dick banter already once the writer umney s family tragedy began to reveal though i thought the show developed an emotional connection that made the viewer me at least feel sympathy for the real life macy s attempt to escape his sorrows by usurping his fictional creation s exciting life the end of the whole mess uh this title is how i felt about this episode when it was over after twenty minutes i was ready to scream at the tv ok we get it already the younger brother is a mega mensa genius prodigy extraordinaire we know from ron livingston talking to the camera time is running out for me not fast enough i thought that the young whiz kid is going to discover something really bad for humanity we know this because he s already built an airplane but almost died because he couldn t steer it out of the path of a tree and he blew up his chemistry lab while teaching himself chemistry to think the end of the world could have been prevented if only this kid had some more parental supervision so much time was wasted on establishing the uber genius of henry thomas when we finally get to the resolution of his discovery the end of the world through unintended idiocy how much do we get to see of the world ending a cheap video shot of a reporter starting to forget what she s reporting on and brief radio broadcasts announcing the day of judgement is at hand oh and the brother s parents drooling and singing old songs my point is if your story is really about the end of the whole mess world i wanna see the mess as it goes up in flames and crashes and burns talk about ending with a whimper indeed crouch end this episode just ticked me off totally i could have lived with the taking forever exposition of the happy couple arriving at their hotel playing slap and tickle having lunch and getting a taxi that was half the episode right there if once they finally crossed over into crouch end the episode delivered the chills but it failed miserabley not only wasn t it scary it was practically laughable ooh look a kitty wait it turns oh my god look at it s scary eye uh huh they could have gone a long way towards filming the crouch end sequence at night instead of in daylight too things you might unintentionally find funny can become scarier when you see them in the night shadows but i guess the budget wasn t high enough to shoot at night on the fake london sets they slapped together for this one on the page this is a very scary story about tourists wandering into places they shouldn t and the terrible things that might lurk just around a corner there the only terror in this adaptation was the directing and acting those were truly horrifying overall series average so far
this movie is very important because suggested me this consideration sometimes you can wish to be sick sometimes you can wish to have a syndrome sometimes for example you can wish have goldfield syndrome that way you d not remember this boring movie and above all you d not remember adam superfluos sandler sometimes simply you can wish have rented another movie my vote out of my suggestion if you are neither a fan of boring romantic comedies or adam sandler it s a joke don t exist adam sandler s fan i want to hope it save yourself someone to save drew barrymore perhaps
if this could be rated a it would be from the atrocious wooden acting to the dull plodding pace the puerile exploitation angle and the sophomoric pseudolesbian titillation added purely for the sake of the sad viewers this is a disaster of a film the plot is predictable as from the beginning one is absolutely certain of what will happen to all of the characters and how the plot will commence from a boring unexceptional beginning to a pathetic and bleak ending every single presence in this film is wasted and every meagre scrap of talent dug up for this turkey is squandered if you want to watch something as relentlessly bleak with plenty of the same childish titillation watch one of the ilsa films at least they re unapologetic and up front about what they re trying to do how something this horrendously bad ever managed to be rated above a is a miracle of how people with no taste or discerning standards can sometimes come together for the most dubious of purposes it s not scary it s not interesting and above all it s not arousing in any sense of the word it is in my opinion a crime it is a crime that such a horribly offensive and incompetent piece of trash was ever conceived of and given the resources to come into existence and even more a tragedy that it is still defended by some woefully misguided viewers not even elvira s cheerful personality and joking ways could soften the blow that this horrifying travesty of film is avoid it at all costs
let me just say i loved the original boogeyman sure it s a flawed clich d s horror movie but hey those types are fun to watch and plus it gave us something a bit different so i gladly bought it and to my surprise this movie came along with it only copy they had actually so i thought eh what the hell and bought it mistake so that night i felt in the mood to watch a movie i actually bought tons that day and figured this was the shortest out of all the ones i bought so i ll just watch this and hit the sack mistake yes i have heard how bad it was but i was willing to take a chance so a few minutes into the movie and there s the first flashback i think nothing of it at first then the new footage with the prediction of the chick in the bathtub and i m kinda liking the direction it s going in then the next flashback which is a bit longer and i m sitting there thinking yes i ve seen the first boogeyman i know what happens so move along then the next one comes up and i figure screw it and fast forward through it then the final one maybe i fast forwarded through the explanation but why was she lying topless on the mirror at least she could ve shown them and i decide to fast forward through it and then the climax and the movie was over wtf what happened to the prediction stuff what happened to the long hair dude did he tap that or what and more importantly what kind of weed was the writer and director smoking when making this awful pos and what was the point was annie just having flashbacks of what happened in the first movie or was the stuff from the first movie just happening at the same time as this the latter could make sense because the stabbing of pantyhose face happened in according to the characters in this movie and it was years later wait a minute no it wouldn t because lacey who the movie questionably renamed nancy is uli too dumb to remember his movie characters names would be years old since she was when that happened and not only is she married to someone who looks ish but also has a kid who looks around and did she get around during middle school and also why would pantyhose be after annie what connection does she even have with the characters of the original movie and a big huge movie mistake i found in this movie is that when the doctor is writing in his notebook does anyone notice that he s just scribbling wow how professional doc so what is the explanation for all of the questions i asked above it s a pointless movie with no thought put into it at all i will try to find a copy of the original movie that comes with just that movie and that s it maybe a couple of extra features any special edition of it yet then i will return this dvd and hopefully this review and all the others will prevent those who haven t seen it from seeing it thus making movie stores get rid of it and this movie may not exist anymore please let that be so sorry this review is so long i m just angry at this movie i had to vent somehow
i watched this knowing almost nothing about it other than the brief description i read here after watching it i was originally going to say that the director shows promise but seems kind of amateurish then i looked at the other stuff he s done to see if this was his first or second movie but no he did house on haunted hill and fear dot com he sort of missed the mark on both those movies and it was the same with this one the story was pretty awful too could someone just fall in love with a girl because she s pretty but has the mind of a child i gave it a because there were some visuals that i rather enjoyed near the end but as a whole this movie is pretty terrible
i would have given this movie a out of if it weren t for ms claudine barretto s performance and i will take this time to overlook that kris aquino s here and end i really avoid watching pinoy horror movies because stories lack originality and i really think that some writers don t give enough attention to the characters and their progression in their stories redundant it was as if they pushed the movie onwards when their storytelling stank and my goodness creative exhaustion led them to rip off other movies why why did this movie get a good review i wouldn t give it that much merit the movie was kind of scary but the movie seemed more freaky as it deals with filipino folklore it goes into my list of most likely to happen category i just wished they spent more time improving the story lines and fix those flash back sequences never mind if the lighting sucked it wouldn t matter much if the content would blow you away sayang
this movie blows let s get that straight right now there are a few scene gems nestled inside this pile of crap but none can redeem the limp plot colin farrel looks like brad pitt in monkeys and acts in a similar manner i normally hate colin because he is a fairy in general but he s ok in this movie there were two plot lines in this movie one about a kid who throws rocks through windshields of moving vehicles and the other about a woman with a moustache let s face it this movie has no freaking idea of what it wanted to say or where it wanted to go the characters story lines intertwine on some levels but are in no means worthy of being included in a script the whole thing is weak and pointless and then there is an occasional ok scene but overall don t bother unless you love irish accents so much that you can watch mediocrity and it is rescued by everyone sounding like the lucky charms elf an american fetish that has catapulted some truly crappy movies to success
films starring child actors put themselves on the back foot from the very beginning while there are some exceptions the majority of kids just cant act and even the ones that can normally become annoying after a few minutes the kids in paperhouse have managed to capture the worst of both worlds as they re both very annoying and they don t have an ounce of acting ability between them in short they re rubbish this isn t good considering that they re the leads and it especially isn t good when you consider the fact that it is virtually impossible to take this film seriously because of the rubbish actors it s a shame that this film is such a dead loss as the plot isn t not completely it follows a young girl who after drawing a picture of a house in her notebook wakes up in the fantasy world that she has created it soon becomes apparent to her that she can manipulate this world through her drawings and so sets about making various changes until her dream eventually becomes a nightmare oh dear as you can see this plot line gives a nice base for a good fantasy horror movie however it is squandered through a number of fatal faults first and foremost in spite of the premise being an excellent premise for lots of inventiveness the movie is extremely stale the central plot is hardly played with at all and the result is an entirely boring experience the lack of tension is another huge gaping flaw in the movie as it sees fit to drag every sequence out to a point that you just don t care any more which is due to a lack of ideas thanks in part to it s lead characters the film feels like a kids movie throughout this is to be expected as it stars kids but bernard rose should have decided the slant that he wanted to put on the story as the horror in the movie is laughable at best the film is also very cheesy and the romance between the two leads is extremely cringe worthy and makes for very painful viewing in fact if i had to sum this travesty up in one word i would choose painful paperhouse is poorly acted laughably plotted very corny and dull on the whole save yourself the pain see something else
before writing this review i went back and reread the reviews of others this movie was a particular disappointment to me since it features two of my favorite dancers gene kelly and george chakiris boasts a score by the often wonderous michel legrand wuthering heights ice station zebra the thomas crowne affair the dancing was stilted unmotivated and unoriginal the songs forgettable the story a joke even the costuming was not particularly flattering only the photography correctly captured the proper mood and spirit i m glad other people enjoyed the young girls of rochefort though i most certainly did not
don t watch this serbian documentary and serbian propaganda look out for this documentary and you will see facts and truth http imdb com title tt the death of yugoslavia documentary series of five episodes is a painstakingly compiled and researched account of the extended mass bloodshed which marked the end of the old federal yugoslavia and spanned almost the entire first half of the s it includes a huge wealth of news footage and interviews with involved parties both yugoslav and otherwise the only real improvement which could be made to this amazing achievement would be the inclusion of later developments in the balkans since the program was made this was indeed done in the late s for a repeat showing on bbc television but the addition of some even more recent events would help to complete this admirably detailed and fulsome piece of work perhaps another whole episode might be warranted the very succinct title of this documentary was made all the more appropriate by the eventual abandonment of the term yugoslavia by the now named federal republic of serbia and montenegro a much belated and formal admission of that which occurred years before not fiction like in yugoslavia the avoidable war
don t even ask me why i watched this the only excuse i can come up with that i was sick with bronchitis and too weak to change the channel it s too terrible for words the movie that is not the bronchitis the acting is deplorable richard grieco hams it up as a trigger happy gun slinging serial killer with a penchant for knocking off cops nick mancuso phones in a performance as the cop on his trail and nancy allen manages to put in the only sympathetic role in the entire film the script is dismal peppered with clich d lines are you ready pardner purrs richard grieco to every single one of his victims dire avoid
if he wanted to be accurate he should have chosen some frisco natives and not a bunch of ny actors who know nothing about the sucka free not sucker free i ve lived in sf my entire life and folks here do not talk or act the way these actors did everything was over dramatized and the only cat i saw from the bay was jt the bigga figga with his little cameo as a rapper no shock that he was the only one in the film who really dressed like cats out here ie his warriors jersey not once did i notice anyone wearing any giants or ers gear instead he fitted them in some cheesy made up sf or oakland jerseys that aren t even sold around here hp has no bowling alleys black and asian gangbangers do not wear head or wristbands with the colors of africa or china s olympic team nor does every chinese gangster wear a yao ming jersey and try and sound black while shooting hoops further while there now is a significant yuppie community that has invaded the mission all that was shown was some white dude and a self proclaimed west coast boriqua this is not new york puerto ricans here are few and far between and the latinos in the mission are very very different from the one that was shown here who was without a doubt from ny also hp is not the only black neighborhood in the city an accurate depiction would have shown the drama between hp sets in their own hood as well as vs fillmore sunnydale lakeview etc this film could ve been much better if lee had done some more homework and had a better storyline to work with
have previously enjoyed wesley snipes in several action flicks and i had expected a lot more even from a score of imdb the movie fails to entertain and even though the story is thin and unoriginal the acting is most unfortunately thinner and goes to mimic a worst case scenario of playing strong feelings accompanied by some bad acting don t waist your time this movie snt entertaining if you wanna cry it might suffice though even though your tears will be wept due to seeing wesley snipes in the tragic action film wannabe comedy i give this it really was awful if you wanna see a decent movie go see shooter or rent it its all the good things this movie isn t
valentine is another horror movie to add to the stalk and slash movie list think halloween friday the th scream and i know what you did last summer it certainly isn t as good as those movies that i have listed about but it s better than most of the ripoffs that came out after the first friday the th film one of those films was the canadian made my bloody valentine which i hated alot valentine is a better film than that one but it s not saying much the plot a nerdy young boy is teased and pranked by a couple of his classmates at the beginning of the film then the film moves years later when those classmates are all grown up then they re picked off one by one the killer is presumed to be the young boy now all grown up looking for revenge but is it him or could it be somebody else valentine has an attractive cast which includes denise richards david boreanaz marley shelton jessica capshaw and katherine heigl they do what they can with the material they ve got but a lackluster script doesn t really do them any justice there are some scary moments throughout however out of four
carlos mencia continually violently hatefully screaming b ch at women is like screaming n ger at black people except it s worse remember the b word unlike the n word is the only pejorative term that is still associated on a daily basis with violence b ch is the last thing women hear before they are raped beaten or murdered this guy is perpetuating violence by hatefully using the language of violence sounds like he may be a gay guy trying to cover by woman bashing so that he will sound like a hetero and how about all the nazi white guys in his audience giving the fascist salutes while their stupid little bimbo white women whimper tee hee hee at their side clearly terrified to protest this tidal wave of woman hating tee hee hee bet mencia doesn t believe or support free speech for them come on carlos do you want women to have the free speech to b ch slap you as loudly and violently and big mouthed as you do or do you think free speech is only for men to crap on women
where to begin this movie started out as something that seemed like a rip off of darkness falls an old disfigured woman living in the woods giving kids presents for their teeth sound familiar then it changes in darkness falls the tooth fairy only killed you if you saw her the tooth fairy in this movie killed you no matter what why did they need the rocker his hippie girlfriend or the bubbas and their sister i think the movie would ve been fine without them it seems like the producers sat around and decided that they needed to put extra people in the movie just so the tooth fairy would have people to kill although it s nice to see a pretty blonde girl not being portrayed as a bubble head for a change okay to rent but i wouldn t suggest buying it
the fact that there are positive comments about dan in real life on the imdb just makes me realize that their junket staff are hard at work trying to get people to watch this utterly horrific film i have no words no idea where to start to describe the truly awful film i sat through last night dan in real life steve s characters in previous films led me to believe that i would feel something for his character and enjoy the dialog but like other posters i felt uncomfortable and embarrassed for the cast the dialog was so contrived the family was this cookie cutter walton s family and the film has been so many times before that i am shocked someone thought it was an original idea do yourself a favor and take a pass on this terrifyingly bad movie and don t believe everything you read on the imdb since the first comments were clearly written by folks sitting in a different theater watching a good film
this is another of the many b minus movies tagged as film noir in the hope of generating some interest in something that is devoid of it all aspects of the film script acting direction are mediocre the acting by the three leads is wooden i guess john dall was expected to go places in the movie business but then someone realised he had little talent and therefore ended up doing tv work lee j cobb who is usually terrific cannot rise above the poor script and poor direction jane wyatt is supposed to be a femme fatale but comes nowhere near convincing the viewers the movie does have two of the strangest looking cars that i have ever seen the one in which john dall goes after lee j cobb is particularly strange the dvd transfer is typical alpha
while i can t deny that his movies are often entertaining i have always personally felt that martin scorsese is just a little overrated in his abilities his use of flashy stylistics in a good number of his movies seems to scream look at me aren t i an imaginative director his best film that i have seen is the one with the least added flourishes the superlative raging bull for this remake it appears it was business as usual though the dull film stock to convey a s setting was so bland as to be a distraction in itself the melodramatic close ups combined with the sub par imitation of the classic psycho score are more likely to provoke smirks of derision than a sense of atmospheric terror the score for psycho was brilliantly unnerving this homage just sounds shrill and annoying even the cast who can be decent at times deliver histrionic performances that just scream caricature the notable exception to this being an intelligent turn by lewis as the impressionable teenage daughter of the bowden family the worst acting offender here is surprisingly de niro sure he looks suitably menacing but as soon as he opens his mouth that aura just drains away now i m no expert on american accents me originally coming from near manchester in england an all but surely he could ve come up with a more convincing southern drawl than that being the gifted physical actor he is he almost overcomes this fatal flaw but not quite it was disconcerting for me as a de niro fan to be wishing he was off screen rather than rapt at his performance possible spoilers the over the top style of the whole movie extends to the ridiculously overblown finale when will scorsese learn that underplaying the situation can sometimes build tension just as effectively as giving the viewer a visual and sonic bombardment i also thought that he was too respected a reputation to resort to the killer not dead yet cheap trick that less talented individuals might employ all in all a thoroughly ridiculous thriller scorsese and de niro have done much better work together
this is certainly one of the most bizarre films ever made even for fellini about the only one more bizarre is his satyricon this is a two and a half hour romp through a strange nightmarish world of decadence opulence and sexual challenge sutherland makes a curiously unappealing casanova and the odd goings on in a series of unrelated vignettes taken from the great lover s autobiography fail to engage the viewer the art direction and costume design are however outstanding the academy missed on not even nominating the former but did itself justice by rewarding an oscar for the latter also nominated oddly was the disjointed pointless and almost inacessible screenplay go figure the film on video is only minutes minutes short of the original running time this viewer was grateful
if you seen rodney dangerfield s previous movies and performances you ll recognise several of the jokes made in this odd piece of dreck written like a sitcom this movie fails to strike any sort of likeable chord throughout from the self help doctor played by the aways sexy as chopped liver molly shannon to the i m fat and therefore funny john linette the wives themselves are likeable enough and if this had been done as a pilot for an action adventure series it might have worked instead it comes off like a male fantasy that s trying hard not to be politically incorrect
i m a big fan of the old westerns and do not believe that hollywood is capable of capturing its old glory but not even ronda fleming and stewart granger can help this movie which carries nearly all the trite characteristics of westerns of the reformed gunfighter turned good guy fallen but virtuous woman bigoted townspeople who must turn to gunfighter for salvation etc i can t help but notice the last names of the writer and young actor who plays granger s son any nepotism there i ve seen better acting in high school plays chill wills plays a cartoon characterization of chill wills have i reached the words yet
i actually had quite high hopes going into this movie so i took what was given with a grain of salt and hoped for the best about of the way through the film i simply had to give up quite simply the movie is a mish mash of stuff happening for no apparent reason and it s all disconnected i love movies that make you think but this movie was just a bunch of ideas thrown together and never really connected don t think it s david lynch esquire as some would have you believe it is nowhere near that realm other than some trippy visuals saying it s artsy to disguise the fact there s no apparent plot or story is just a manner or justifying why you wasted the hours in the film the acting was good but that cannot save lack of story i do agree with the one comment posted previously it s like being in some other person s head while they re on drugs in other words nothing makes sense
let s just say i had to suspend my disbelief less for spiderman than i did for hooligans that is to say i have less of a problem believing toby mcguire can stick to buildings than i do elija wood throwing down with toughs in manchester i won t get into specifics as i don t want to write a spoiler but the idea of grown professional british men getting into near death scraps every weekend is well funny and this film is not the fighting the idea of fighting is taken far too seriously the gravity of the pugilism the reverence with which the subject matter is treated becomes irritating as it neither establishes or resolves the conflict it seems as though the plot with holes big enough to drive a guiness truck through has been slapped together with a contrived fish out of water theme so that viewers can gaze into woods teary eyes as he learns how to become a man ie hitting other young men of opposing football tastes with blunt objects and then running away as fast as he can the characters are cartoonish especially the americans at harvard the character development and story line are telegraphed to the viewer throughout the picture unfortunately the absurdity of the film doesn t reach its height until nearly the end which by then you ll have spent nearly two hours of your life you are never getting back pick up the football factory or fight club instead of this corny and disappointing dud it doesn t waste time with empty melodrama the tired old yankee in king aurthur s court or weepy parables of coming of age bullsh t they re just pure dark and clever fun the way violence is supposed to be
this movie was poorly written poorly acted and very predictable it was very low budget and i can understand why it was never released and went straight to video it wasn t even campy fun it was just a complete disaster and i wish i could get the hours back the colors were horrible along with the plot which has holes so big in it you could drive a mac truck through them the plot itself had the young bride doing things that she absolutely was not physically capable of doing what a stretch skip this movie and watch something better in the horror genre just about any movie comes to mind that is better than this ejames
i saw this movie twice through a pentecostal church my family attended in nanaimo bc in the s i was of the tender age of my brother then again when i was my brother this movie terrified my brother and i and shaped how we viewed the world with distrust it wasn t just the movie but it was also the philosophy that engulfs so many christians about the mark of the beast and the rapture this movie the church and a volatile neglectful upbringing lead to severe paranoia towards the future for years i lived under the delusional affects of the church and fear of being forgotten by christ i am now years old went through years of counseling i once explained to a psychiatrist this movie and the belief system of the church and family i was pegged with a delusional disorder i actually began to believe this it was my brother who reminded me that this cultic philosophy actually happened i no longer fear the future i have come to terms with the fear injected into it s members by the church i have taken this experience to fulfill a purpose i am nearing my licensure as a psychologist specializing in childhood trauma
the dialogue was pretty dreadful the plot not really all that inspired beyond the obvious twist it presents not visually stunning actually visually annoying at times most definitely one of those films you find easier to finish if you keep one finger on the fast forward button if you could watch it for free have absolutely no other options open at the moment and you really dig seeing the little poltergeist lady well maybe i d recommend it to you but not anyone else i could think of at the moment
hip erotic wickedly sexy whatever it s the terminator with werewolves no seriously the cop saves the girl waitress from the big monster and refers to himself as her protector the lead actor ryan alosio does a pretty good job of emulating kyle reese there s a massacre in a police precinct the bad guy is muscular with red eyes and it even contains dialogue along the lines of you said it yourself he won t ever stop never the dire script comes from a first time screenwriter who thank god hasn t sold anything since this and it s all thrown together by famously bad director richard friedman the movie opens in a strip bar always a good sign and a mean looking biker guy bursts in for no apparent reason pursued by three cops one of them is black and shock horror he s the one who gets killed in the first five minutes the film goes downhill for the next hour or so then picks up a little with some decent action sequences before rounding it all up with an abysmal ending for the most part the cast come across as competent actors doing what they can with a bad script and a director who s willing to settle for less if nothing else they appear to be learning how to act in this movie and alosio along with some of the supporting cast shows signs of talent darkwolf in his human form is played by gargantuan kane hodder famous for his numerous portrayals of jason vorhees in the friday the th movies he s decent enough especially considering he isn t used to speaking roles it s become famous amongst groups of horny teenage boys for the lesbian rooftop scene between andrea bogart and sasha williams who gets her kit off a couple of times in the grand tradition of former power rangers actresses and it s unnervingly clear that the editor spent way too much time on that scene anyway the main redeeming feature is that the physical werewolf effects are rather good and the design of the wolf isn t bad at all but the cgi is bad just plain bad i mean seriously if you can t reach some level of realism why bother just throw a little extra money into the make up aside from the terrible script this movie does have it s moments many of which are unintentionally funny it s good for a laugh if you don t have anything better to do but just don t spend any money on it please
my wife and i just finished watching b su aka the booth she fell asleep during some parts of the movie i really wish i had taken a snooze with her but the unfortunate fact is that the main character s voice is so loud and grating that it was impossible for me to sleep when our protagonist speaks it makes me want to hear regis philbin and william shatner sing karaoke he also has no redeeming qualities i was hoping he d get hit by a bus five minutes into the film don t get me wrong i love asian horror cinema but the booth is extremely irritating and full of scenes that really make no damned sense at all if you want some good asian cinema check out a tale of two sisters or into the mirror avoid the booth like the plague especially if you suffer from frequent migraines
i ve just lost hours of my life watching this mindless plot i could make a better movie with my cellphone camera how do they manage to get actors to play in those movies porn movies have better scenarios and effects i wish i had those hours back the only good thing about this movie is the cast even though their acting skills in this one could not lift this movie to passable the rest was just way too bad it s the type of movie that i d recommend using to torture prisoners into scaring them straight even worse i saw a translated version of this flick imagine a bad movie with an even worst translation yikes
the first look on the cover of this picture it looks like a good rock n roll movie but don t let the cover fool you or the fact that alice cooper and blondie is in it the storyline is just horrible and so is the acting plain and simple badit s not a movie about a roadie its just a thin love story so awful that you see right through it the only good thing about this movie is the soundtrack some good songs and that is why i give out of if it wasn t for the music it would of been out of meat loaf is a horrible actor at least he was in and the girl who plays the groupie isn t even good looking this movie was a huge disappointment for me because it makes a lot of good promises
st watched out of dir jim kammerud brian smith drab and un spectacular supposed sequel to the original classic animated dalmatians yes the movie continues where it ended in the first one but the problem is that it plays out much like the original one of the great things about the original was the pacing of the story which this one doesn t have the animation is also very un spectacular for disney and all we get is the same characters going thru the same kind of story all over again when is disney going to stop boring us with sequels and re do s etc etc probably when we stop renting or buying this mediocre fare that they have put out
i didn t expect much when i saw this at the palm springs film fest this weekend it was an alternate choice when two other films were sold out still i held out hope it sounded a bit much like bride and prejudice l a guy falls for an indian beauty parental conflict blah blah blah b p was not perfect but it was an enjoyable film with some good laughs and likable characters my bollywood bride had none of that the acting seemed stilted and way to by the numbers characters were so clich the story seemed like it could have been written by high school freshman drama student technically the sound really bothered me it seemed as if there was a lot of over dubbing of dialogue i mean a lot i know sometimes it s necessary but it sounded like half the film was shot in a closet and it became very distracting two stars is being somewhat generous
really no reason to examine this much further because of a few very glaring and bias misleading statements a perfect example is when the filmmaker claims saul or paul of tarus the writer of the book of hebrews he asserts has no idea jesus is or was a human being this assertion is either purposely false as he accuses others of presenting or he is ignorant of what the bible says first we can examine his misleading claim about hebrews which he shows a quote if jesus was on earth he would not be a priest hence right here he sets up the ignorant and unlearned viewer to accept his false premise why he does what most so called bible believing people he accuses of doing the same that is taking things out of context verse one of hebrews is now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum we have such an high priest who is set on the right hand of the throne of the majesty in the heavens the context above is clearly speaking of a jesus who was on earth and ascended into heaven after his alleged resurrection it has nothing to do with how the filmmaker wants the viewer to take his out of context scripture here he offers a foundation that paul was not aware of a human jesus but only one in heaven follow lets see if the filmmaker is being honest hebrews for it is evident that our lord sprang out of judah of which tribe moses spake nothing concerning priesthood heh didn t the filmmaker just quote from the writer of hebrews trying to show the writer of that book has no knowledge of a human jesus it s likely anyways paul didn t write hebrews but i will not go into that here but the film maker asserts paul did and that is the premise of the point given here it is not like this film maker does not make decent points in certain areas he does but he is engaging in the same blind bias of the religion he is bashing on once he engages in these tactics in my strong opinion he loses credibility as the religion he picks out and the film is no longer a documentary but a personal opinion and a bias of the film maker nothing more nothing less
bela lugosi is not typecast in this fantastic twelve part adventure serial playing the lead as frank chandler chandu the magician enjoying his role as a representative of the forces of white magic pushed against those of black while displaying vigourous fighting skill successfully wooing a young egyptian princess and cutting a lean and dashing figure in yachting gear complete with nautical cap the somewhat lumpy plot engages chandler chandu in an ongoing series of escapades pointed at achieving the rescue of his fiancee princess nadji maria alba and others from the clutches of the idol worshipping sect of ubasti which covets nadji s blood in order to revivify an ancient mummified princess entombed upon the mysterious island of lemuria director ray taylor an old hand at such entertainments keeps events moving briskly but repeated scenes and footage a good deal of which is to be found in the previous year s skull island setting from king kong and the port locale from son of kong reduces original action to less than minutes from the serial s running length of over two and one half hours and if viewed at one sitting becomes lacking in effect to most viewers unless insomniac
terrible movie nuff said these lines are just filler the movie was bad why i have to expand on that i don t know this is already a waste of my time i just wanted to warn others avoid this movie the acting sucks and the writing is just moronic bad in every way the only nice thing about the movie are deniz akkaya s breasts even that was ruined though by a terrible and unneeded rape scene the movie is a poorly contrived and totally unbelievable piece of garbage ok now i am just going to rag on imdb for this stupid rule of lines of text minimum first i waste my time watching this offal then feeling compelled to warn others i create an account with imdb only to discover that i have to write a friggen essay on the film just to express how bad i think it is totally unnecessary
shlock merchant leo fulci takes a change of pace by making a trashy barely coherent sword and sorcery fantasy movie instead of his usual trashy barely coherent horror a wimpy orlando bloom type called ilias from some society vaguely resembling ancient greece travels across the ocean to caveman territory on some vaguely defined quest to battle evil where he joins up with a animal loving hunter to battle the wolf man and mutant minions of a vampiric topless evil sorceress wackiness ensues the sorceress is oppressing the local cavemen and wants the magic bow for herself she sends various minions each weirder than the last after our heroes who win through in the end striking a blow for oppressed cavemen everywhere this movie contains a steady stream of wtf elements and moments for some reason the entire movie is shot in soft focus and the picture is further blurred by the constant presence of mist on screen this may have been an attempt to create atmosphere or to hide how fake everything looks either way it failed there is no atmosphere unless it is one of scuzziness and mild bewilderment and there is no hiding how lame everything looks the wolf man minions look like a poor man s wookie for some reason the director fell in love with shots of them leaping through the air in slow motion six million dollar man style toward our heroes when they attack there are probably about a dozen of these shots throughout the movie and it gets goofier every time the other minions of the topless sorceress other than the generic leather clad humans are some lumpy white mutants who appear to be covered in cobwebs needless to say they are slow and unthreatening and when they speak sound like gay hispanic lisping daleks the fights are stilted and unconvincing and the special effects are woeful oh yeah the music is cheap synthesiser stuff that the makers of doctor who would have been embarrassed to have used ilias our nominal hero is bland and forgettable he also looks a complete wuss especially with his midriff revealing leather outfit and big hair and is clearly a moron sure he s a dynamite shot with his magical bow but he only takes about three or four arrows with him in his mission to battle this entire continent of evil needless to say he runs out of arrows within a few minutes and has to be saved by more traditional sword and sorcery hero mace when he meets ilias he establishes himself as the taciturn loner type claiming he has no friends but no sooner can you say latent homoerotic subtext they are bosom buddies traipsing the misty hills together mace promises to take ilias with him in return for bow related favours ilias asks where he is going wherever my legs take me is his reply good enough for ilias mace is also animal lover and outrageous hypocrite he proclaims his great love of and affinity toward animals citing the usual stuff about how he prefers them to humans because humans can be soooo mean he says he would never hunt and kill an animal to feed himself but he will steal meat off other people who have hunted down animals he is also not above randomly killing innocent passers by for no good reason not long after they meet he is testing out ilias bow and the movie cuts to some random caveman minding his own business walking along and mace shoots him dead there is no indication this poor soul did anything to deserve this and even ilias who supposedly hails from a more moral and civilised society doesn t even raise an eyebrow the films villainess is quite unusual for the entire movie she is completely naked except from a g string and a golden mask that encompasses her entire head it s like fulci included her to make the movies obligatory t a quotient but decided she was bit too much of a butterface at the last minute she spends a lot of time seemingly being pleasured by her pet snakes and dreaming about being shot by a faceless bow wielding man who is dressed like ilias wow such symbolism later on in the movie she wimps out when she can t beat ilias and mace and promises to make herself the sex slave of some ancient warrior dude if he kills them for her hardly the world s most scary villain and not really a step forward for women s rights i think he sic s the cobweb creatures on our heroes and impersonates mace in a situation where there is no no one else around but mace to fool was he really worthy trading your self respect for ocron there are quite a few other wtf moments most of them come toward the end of the movie ilias wusses out i forget why possibly his permed hairdo got mussed but realizes the error of his ways and returns to aid mace in fighting the forces of evil all of a sudden for no reason his bow can suddenly fire out multiple target seeking bolts of energy the bolts can also shoot through solid rock when necessary needless to say his makes short work of the hordes of bad guys who have captured mace the climax is also rather nonsensical mace decimates ocron s remaining forces using the bows targeted laser attack capability he then is able to shoot ocron from a kilometre away using its shoot through rock capacity she starts dying her mask is ripped of revealing a hideous muppet head she staggers around screaming and turns into a dog and wanders off with another dog mace smiles roll credits strangely enough as far as these dodgy low budget sword and sorcery movies this one is reasonably lucid and focused any one who has seen wizards of the lost kingdom can tell you how nonsensical and meandering these movies can truly be
the characters are cliched and predictable with everyone being either snow white pure or wholly evil the acting is too stilted for it to be bad in an amusing over the top way it s doubly disappointing if you re a bette davis fan because her character is not a typically fun bette davis type character she just gets to frown pensively a lot on the whole neither my wife nor i found the movie to be interesting moving or enjoyable at all
i am very unpolitically correct guy so when i say sexist i really mean it reduced the female guest lead dr miranda jones played by diana muldar in spite of all her supposed brilliance and self control to nothing more inside but a big jealous unreasonable baby you prolly got the plot by now after her technical sidekick marvik also a spurned lover flips out when he tried to kill the medusan ambassador kollos out of a jealous rage but glimpsed first it instead you think he could have just walked in to the room with his eyes shut and phasered the box too easy he takes the enterprise into un navigable space outside the galaxy before the boys could subdue him well the ship is stuck in limbo at that point they could have gone to the good lady doctor liaison and discussed it spock has to make a mind meld with the medusan so we can get home i mean like beetch do you want to stay adrift until we run out of supplies and die but the lady in true star trek fashion is a jealous monsters who whines and wails when the idea is broached even when her medusan idol told her to shut up go along with them so the beetch out of spite messes with the melded spock causing him to forget to put on his visor which makes spock go insane kirk naturally figured out what a total twit she was and shamed her into fixing spock up with her superior telepathic powers of course at the end the lady and medusan leave and all is forgiven you almost wish the president from battle star galactica showed up to jettison the witch out of an airlock for her destructive stunt but in star trek land ladies are permitted to be totally unreasonable and cruel yet at the same time supposedly there is sexual equality this is what i mean by sexist
actually the movie is neither horror nor sci fi with a very strong christian religious theme this movie delivers minimal content and no suspense second tier actors do half decent jobs of reading their boring roles the only good performance is by sydney penny who plays a role of a mother of i won t spoil the movie it s either christ or anti christ avoid watching this movie unless you a christian religious fanatic obsessed with apocalypse being a non christian i had to force myself to watch this movie just because i wanted to write this review it s a pity that sci fi channel had to air this movie at the peak evening time
this film is terrible every line is stolen from mm the italian dubbed version at least if you like trash real trash give it a try but beware this ain t the so bad it s good kind of flick in its cheapness it may really look like a porno but believe me if you re looking for snuff s m hardcore softcore or even an ordinary erotic thriller go find something else in store i m telling you this cause the absolutely uninspired and unconvincing shooting acting plot dialogues the only good lines as i said before are the ones they stolen from joel schumacher s mm will bore you to tears in a few minutes and the happy ending is absolutely revolting i ll give it one star a half for the sudden shot in the back scene after the eyes of the victim monologue stolen from mm as well and a half for mom daughter s sexy bodies that didn t manage to keep me completely awake while watching this turkey anyway
basically caprica is the cylon origin story the premise of the show is interesting however the writers follow so many story lines and clog it with too many pov characters that it bogs down the storytelling the plot creeps at glacial speeds dissipating what tension it might have had in any given episode little or nothing happens daniel graystone eric stolz is a military contractor working on a robotic soldier using a stolen chip unfortunately his only working prototype is driven by the ai version of his dead daughter zoe who died in a suicide bombing caused by soldiers of the one sto an underground monotheist extremist group meanwhile joseph adama father of battlestar galactica s commander adama is struggling to hold his family together while searching for the ai version of his daughter who also died in the bombing in a machiavellian virtual version of caprica which strongly resembles s chicago in addition to the vapid writing caprica suffers from a similar problem as many origin stories we already know how it ends i e the cylons develop their own civilization and rebel against humanity
alright normally i am not as harsh on sequels especially if the first film is done well and was ultimately a good movie as for i feel that one of the top five films was cruel intentions it had everything a great movie should have except for an original story being adapted from a novel it was still damn good on to cruel intentions which was supposed to actually just be the opener for a series based on the film called manchester prep which must not have happened actually after seeing this trifle of a film i can understand before the thing started i was like at least the writer and director roger kumble did this one also well minute into this movie i was disappointed it starts off with a rehash of the opening of the original with a different twist sebastian instead of putting the shrinks daughter s naked picture on the net he puts the schools principals wife in the school directory naked this would have been alright if the lady was not like and basically the rest of the movie is a wannabe carbon copy of the original which i understand the if there is nothing wrong with it leave it the way it was but you can not do that with a movie this actually being a prequel i gave it a chance just to see how they turned out like they did in part but with sebastian being more or less just a prankster and kathryn being a herself and turning sebastian into the sexual predator he was in the real story this movie had no foundation to it whoever did the casting on this thing was way off they could have at least tried to get people who looked like the original cast but no they just hired a bunch of not even really good looking actors i am using this term although i dont know why they for sure didnt do any in this movie all this movie is a bunch of one liners that dont even match the wit that the original had well some of them did but that was just because they were from part another bad point was in part one you could understand the need for them to act out for attention because there was no involvement from teir parents this one had them in it and they were poorly used as if to show why the kids are like this it didnt work though the best thing though about the original was that the cast had chemistry they took you into this world the on screen tension that was there made the film what it was this thing really ruins the experience of the first one stay way from this
i m not a huge freddy krueger fan but that doesn t mean that i don t like robert englund and his other nightmare on elm street movies i think that robert is a very good actor nobody plays a better freddy krueger than he does but no offense robert this movie sucked the acting is terrible the plot is really weak and freddy krueger is the only part of the cast that s even worth watching sometimes sequels can be better than the first such as the friday the th franchise i thought the remake was the best in the series but this isn t one of those movies the original was good the nd in my opinion was better the rd was okay but i haven t seen the others whatever you do don t make the same mistake i did by watching this piece of crap
i have heard a lot about this film with people writing me telling me i should see it as i am a fan of extremely bloody gory movies i got my hands on it almost right away but one thing or another always kept me from watching it until now i would have been better off not remembering i even had it this movie was atrocious the worst thing though is that it could have been so much better than it actually was i know it was a story by clive barker and all and no i have not read that story but it appears to me that if you haven t then you will be as i was completely clueless and utterly disappointed the film begins good enough the actors are convincing the story interesting the first scene is bloody a great way to catch your attention i thought the blood looked a bit bad but seeing as it was the very first scene i did hope for improvement later on i was wrong the blood and effects are so horrible it was almost an insult to my intelligence to be expected to believe that for instance someone could knock a person s head right off their shoulders using only a meat hammer wtf cgi blood did they even use any real blood at all my home made stuff looks better than any used in this film unbelievable acts of dismemberment eyeballs popping out just from getting hit in the back of the head arms cut neatly off does no one remember there are bones all throughout our bodies too dark scenes every scene is either an odd yellow color or in hidden in shadows it just gets worse and worse i found myself pointing out mistake after mistake there s just too much add that to the fact that what could have and should have been a great serial killer movie turns into some demonic supernatural monster movie at the end no thank you it should have been kept as a creepy guy butchering people in the subway ok with a conspiracy theory thrown in and an overzealous photographer maybe they murder people and sell the meat via the meat plant plausible doable and a lot better i think than the real story that could have and should have worked instead it became a creatures living at the end of the old tunnel and everyone knows about it but you and unless you read the book well you just won t ever understand it fiasco tragic what an awful thing to do to a movie with such potential if you like mindless fake blood and gore you ll love this but if you have half a brain in your head then you will completely hate it stay away far far away
this is just a joke of a movie they lost me already at the opening scene spoilerwarning dangerous creature kills other creature in his cage this is watched by a scientist that works there on a monitor and guess what she does well lets go in to the cage to check the stuff out omg how dumb do those writers think human beings are come on thats the same like jumping in a fish tank with a great white shark because it ate your goldfish pretty useless and even more dumber and i will not even talk about the cast because they aren t worth the effort why they didn t fired the guy that wrote that immediately is a mystery to me and this kinda dumbness continues the entire movie only good thing where the cgi that is better then average for these kinda low budget movies if these kinda things don t bother you go see it but be warned if your iq is above you will probably hate it
this film should have never been made honestly i must admit that before i saw it i had some serious doubts the director is not a great actress though she did a lot of movies in holland and the young woman who took the main part is a tv personality with a constant smile on the face and not much self criticism the actor who played the other main part i recently saw in bride flight and although that film is better he did not convince me than to start with the the story i have not read the novel it is based upon but the script that underlays the film is something that might have been done with in mind kids having a birthday party on a rainy sunday afternoon not someone of the same age as the director who likes to watch a good movie something really disturbing were the overdubbed dialogues it was most of the time spoken out loud my regards go to the cameraman at least he tried to make something out of it it is a pity that the film is edited lousy if not some scenes were certainly more credible
this was a watershed event in my movie watching life i went to see this in the theater when it came out i was completely amazed at just how bad it was movies like this make you wonder who put the money up and who owed whom a favor a very very large favor the special effects are absolutely first grade level as in any first grader could have done them toy rubber bats on strings with no attempt to hide the strings arrows that appear to be drawn on the film and look to be the shape of an arrow you d find on a street sign and a laughable story line ed wood made masterpieces compared to conquest every film student should see this thing just so they ll know the very definition of a bad movie
prior to this release neil labute had this to say about the original it s surprising how many people say it s their favorite soundtrack i m like come on you may not like the new one but if that s your favorite soundtrack i don t know if i want you to like my film neil a word you might want to sit down for this too as lord summerisle says shocks are so much better absorbed with the knees bent see neil the thing about the original is that paul giovanni s soundtrack is one of the most celebrated things about it the filmmakers themselves consider it a virtual musical along with richard and danny thompson and bert jansch it practically kick started the s folk new wave to undermine it is akin to imagining jaws without john williams or the buddy holly story without buddy holly the result s one of the most breathtakingly arrogant pointless remake of a british cult classic since sly stallone s get carter the original had apparently left nicolas cage disturbed for about two weeks so disturbed during that fortnight s window that he pitched the idea of re imagining one of the most nuanced films about inter faith struggle ever devised to a writer director previously known for his wholly unsubtle depictions of male chauvinism it s like some parlor game what would you get if sam peckinpah took on bambi or gaspar irreversible noe remade love actually actually i d quite like to see that unfortunately someone took this parlor game seriously all labute s succeeded in doing is ripping out the original s guts while saddling it with his own gormless sex war preoccupations after failing to rescue a little girl and her mum from a fatal car crash cage s highway patrolman spirals into a medicated torpor then he receives a letter from ex fianc e willow woodward this one trades on name homages for kudos now living on the private island community of summersisle that extra s stands for superfluous and wants edward to help locate missing daughter rowan summersisle it transpires is a female dominated joint conceived as a haven for oppressed womenfolk and refugees from the salem witch trials here the matriarchs observe the olde ways and the few males are near mute breed mules it s like lilith fair on a grand scale summersisle s main export is honey a symbolic and literal headache for edward as he s allergic to bees beekeepers cries edward they seem to be everywhere on this island well that s probably because summersisle s main export is honey while making his investigations edward overhears of an oncoming mayday ritual called the time of death and rebirth he discovers the previous year s crop failed nearly dies from bee stings and eventually comes to the conclusion a conclusion which admittedly couldn t be more obvious if the locals had tattooed a timetable of events on the back of his hands that rowan will be burnt alive in a pagan rite to ensure a bountiful harvest he also meets the queen bee of the hive sister summersisle burstyn who has her own plans for him involving the eponymous wicker man the drone must die first the good news any concerns cage would be airlifted from the wicker man s flaming jaws at the last minute by a fleet of black cia helicopters can be laid to rest he toast that s about it for the good news this is a story whose chapters were carefully written intones burstyn with sublime irony though retaining the basic cat and mouse premise and credits typography what s left subjects the original to a scorched earth policy crucial to shaffer s original screenplay was that his christian copper in accordance with ritual came to the island of his own free will and most importantly was a virgin the perfect sacrifice in reducing matters to a sexual as opposed to a religious power struggle labute presents the flimsiest of qualifiers for a harvest sacrifice by the time cage has worked out he was the bait you honestly couldn t care less and cage is one of the very worst things in this a lumbering drawling donkey an arsewit whose tongue seems just slightly too big for his mouth goddamit he moans after he hallucinates a drowned rowan with all the mental torment of a man who s set his morning alarm clock half an hour too early one hopes it s his character s frequent reliance on pills that has reduced him to this state alternately fatigued then full of preppy overbearing vim if so it s a fine portrayal of an undistinguished iq addled with anti depressants if not it doesn t bear thinking about as willow the saucer eyed beahan is similarly dreadful presenting her lines as if in competition with cage for the most half hearted delivery while burstyn entirely lacks the mercurial menace to convince who s afraid of naomi wolf every element that made the original great the lovingly detailed depictions of folk customs the ingenious score the dialogue lord summerisle s majestic you did it beautifully has been replaced with the rather less attractive you did it excellently whoah dude have been substituted for a meandering battle of the sexes thriller with occasional crash bang wallop namely walloping women this is a labute flick after all cage s sister beech bashing is just one of the more embarrassing episodes impotent little men will be hooting with glee at how them uppity hippie chicks finally got what was comin to em hyuk hyuk the closing coda sees the whole rotten mess collapsing under the weight of genre clich in a bar two guys run into a couple of summersisle maidens on shore leave flirty fishing for fresh martyrs at the moment of their successful pick up you half expect the women to turn round and give an exaggerated wink and a thumbs up to the camera one more thing keen credit watchers may have noticed that films sporting an unusually high producer count anything up to tend to be not much cop the wicker man has producers in total
anyone not aware of the original british lion movie the wicker man would no doubt have left the cinema with the impression poor and peurile as a devotee of the original i left with the impression purely poor from the grim reality of haggle toothed inbreds drawing the force of law and order into a web of paganistic barbaric ritual on a remote scottish island named summerisle the original to a near amazon ic colony off the maine coast of the us named summersisle the remake hardly hits the spot this is quite sadly a case of what could have been a classic remake of a classic being tampered with to cater for a simple minded public nothing more and nothing less gentlemen or given the reworked context of the film ladies involved hang your heads in shame
the scenery is pretty and the dog is cute other than that this film has absolutely nothing to recommend it jack warden is pleasantly genial as usual but the script is so awful that even he comes off badly the plot makes no sense the dialogue is dumb and there are numerous smaller faults but the dog is cute
i found this a good movie to pass your time but not by any chance of any historical value the portrayal of cleopatra reminded me a cheap soap opera the twist of the facts is funny she gave birth while feeding her people o please a pregnant queen of egypt especially this one would not bother to go from one room to the other for that reason they tried to make her appear a saint for god s sake and the way they tried to justify her murdering her own sister beyond description cleopatra was the greatest politician of her time her decisions were based anything but her feelings and morals she did everything for only two reasons power and self preservation she was borne in a family where she had to straggle for survival something she did very well anything that stood on her way was either murdered her brothers and sister or seduced ceasar and mark anthony unfortunately octavian was too powerful to kill and too gay to be seduced so he was her end
apparently hollywood is just handing out money to anyone with a camera and the ability to speak this movie was mind numbingly bad the casting was terrible the acting unspeakable and the story filled with holes script who needs script i was surprised that the movie wasn t as verbally vulgar as i thought it would be however i got enough shots of t a to last me a lifetime the movie was like listening to a year old street racer with add who decided to buy a car instead of go to college tell a story being so poorly scripted i thought the two brothers in the film were lovers at first the scenes at the racetrack along with the main female actor in the film kept making me think of herbie fully loaded this is the kind of film is what grindhouse modeled itself after only the writers thought they were being serious
i hate this movie i hate the show i hate just about everything about it it s so annoying and stupid everyone s saying that nat and alex wolff are heroes in the music world and that they re going to make it big what kind of drugs are you taking nat and alex are going to end up as either hobos or end up like jane hudson from whatever happened to baby jane i could only get through not even minutes of this one barely seconds of the show and i managed to survive about half an hour of battle of the bands how anyone could cheer for these guys in the audience at the kid s choice awards i have no clue days before the movie premiere on nick most of the teen girl actresses on nick jamie spears emma roberts lindsey shaw etc showed up in a commercial influencing brain dead kids about how awesome nat and alex wolff are first off they didn t trick me and second of all nat and alex probably either drugged them or payed them loads of money in order to say that and sound convincing because i don t see how anyone could find this show movie entertaining the music is just awful nat s singing sounds like a sick dying moose on crack alex is the most annoying movie tv show character ever he s not funny he s annoying he s really weird and he thinks he s hot and knows everything about girls this guy s lucky if he ever manages to get laid you know this show is fake when you find out that some of the characters in real life don t even exist the character jesse is actually played by nat and alex s cousin jesse draper they mustve had some budget problem their father is not single he s married to polly draper but she doesn t appear on the show making it seem the wolff s are mom less rosalina doesn t exist either her name is allie dimeco i ll tell ya the naked brothers are gonna be in some deep sh when their fans find out the whole thing is staged
didn t care for the movie the book was better does anyone know where it was filmed this was my first visit to your site just found the answer to my question so now i look like a dummy but i think i ll still submit my comments and yes british columbia is lovely or why they took it from its south carolina coastal setting this question stands the place was essential to the fabric of the book and its change was part of my disappointment with the movie oh i just read where i need to write at least ten lines here s my other main issue with the film kim bassinger was too vapid and not at all what i pictured from the book i know the book was the book and the movie well not so good i found the character in the book much more empathetic also the book evoked rustic almost primitive images of the monastery while the castle in the film was much more visually impressive it distorted the feel of the story and seemed at odds with the characters
this horrendously bad piece of trash manages to be racist sexist and homophobic all at once while pretending to be terribly chic and sophisticated atrocious performances a cliche ridden screenplay and boring direction make this movie one to steer clear of two scenes were especially offensive the one in which schaech scrubs his tongue after being kissed by another man could it really have been that gross and the scene where eastwood is kissed by schaech s best friend who is pretending to be russian after he leaves the room she exclaims f king foreigners so much for her being a cultured artist who dreams of living in paris jonathon schaech can be a likeable actor on screen and is astonishingly good looking it s a shame he didn t learn more from working with cutting edge gay director gregg araki on an earlier film and try to salvage this film from descending into a string of gay stereotypes and a mire of homophobia
just as its a mad mad mad mad world is at the top of my list for all time greatest comedies ever made this one is at the very bottom of course i could be wrong not having seen saving silverman in other words it s a lame lame lame lame comedy rating out of
frankly i m rather incensed that on the basis of the dazzling reviews attributed to steven smith i wasted nearly two hours on his debut offering have they all been written by his pals the action clunks along the music is irritating and over used the script is simply dire and the actors with the exception of the gardener mediocre at best i do think we should support the efforts of a young filmmaker but saying it s brilliant when it s not will surely only encourage him to make the same mistakes again i e continuing to write his own scripts and using the same actors for another venture yes it s his first film low budget etc i get it but it s also out there for members of the public to purchase and it s just not up to scratch
when discussing a movie titled snakes on a plane we should point out early that the snakes are pretty darn important to the plot what we have here are very bad cgi snakes that neither look nor move like real snakes snakes are scary because they appear to be slimy they crawl they slither these snakes do nothing of the sort they glide along like they would in a video game they are cartoon snakes i would go as far to say that even someone that had a major phobia against real snakes would not find these ones scarywhy on earth then would you want to include extreme close ups of these cgi failures why not rely on suspense the whole less is more ethic or better still why not just make them look good in the first place and then maybe still use them sparinglytake one look at john carpenters the thing here we have real slime and gore of eerie proportions years go by and we get this pile of stinking sfx crap snakes on a plane when are these people going to wake up and smell the coffee special effects are going backwards sure you could say but the movie is a joke get it sure i m with that idea but do it well in addition to the above this movie has crap dialogue and the music and sound effects are not creepy or memorable in any way i could handle every other actor being part of this movie except for jackson what was he doing there the man who starred in pulp fiction years ago is this career progression are you offering people value for money no i d like to know what tarantino thought when he was half way through this stinker of a moviethe current generation seem to have very low expectations and hollywood seems to be offering them just what they want on leaving the cinema i saw a number of advertisements for some truly horrendous looking future releases including doa dead or alive another cgi animal film called flushed away and another crap looking comedy named click in addition to that i saw some awful trailers including one for another crap british horror comedy i ve truly not seen the movie industry in a mess like this for a long timeexpect to see this movie for sale in the dvd bargain section for in months time and if you re expecting to see a black comedy with tonnes of great looking snakes and some bad ass cool dialogue coming from samuel l jacksons lips forget it
people love the original story for its ending the hollywood style ending made this version of a dog of flanders just for kids movie i didn t cry this time because the story was too hollywood japanese tv series are much better
i just saw this movie on flix after timer taping it i grew up watching f troop and had a major hard for wrangler jane so i was shocked literally shocked to find out after seeing this film that the degenerate homicidal nurse was melody patterson who looks pretty good but also looks completely different and is unfortunately poorly photographed i would never have guessed it was her in a million years what the hell is she doing in a picture like this i agree with the guys here that the movie lacks what it s pushing no sex no gore no tease it s also a remake of the atomic brain aka monstrosity or thereabouts most of the action is tedious the main character spends enormous amounts of time running around the crazed doctor s house and basement and the neighborhood in general or being roughed up by the cop all of it boring and time filling now if the italians would have made this half the film would have been the slingblade uncle ernest jack elam henchman fondling the unconscious nude girls but you only get that for seconds
my comment is for the russian version of space race named bitva za kosmos battle for space shown on russia s first channel on april bad translation could have ruined some details but i doubt it s the case the number of factual errors is such that it s impossible to list them especially in the first episode the development of first missiles even the u s half of the film contains multiple errors and omissions the audience is not told of any v a launches from the u s three different jupiter c rockets are launched with the same serial number ue onboard apollo is to be launched to the moon etc in the russian half each and every person is ludicrous korolev is scared of nkvd glushko is saboteur and traitor mishin is alcoholic etc men as functions no motivation no life at all uniform and decorations are awful gagarin sings a frivolous song awaiting launch i think this was added specially for russian version
the movie is a total crap we have two good actors who are miscast and a meat head of an actor salman khan just to attract the female audience the story is a crap the characters poorly sketched non existent story telling no editing to speak of ajay devgan as a rock star that is a dream in itself the movie drags along to the point of decadence the whole charade about arjun bringing his manna to london let him grope his girlfriend and let him not play at wembley vimbley in the dubbing process is absurd salman khan s over the top acting or faking is too painful to watch i remember seeing some good movies from this producer vipul shah but this is not one of them it seems all the good directors are falling prey to the box office mania that the mumbai media morons have created this is yet another crap movie in the lines of wanted with idiot actor like salman khan who has no place in a good hindi cinema he is good to the indian cinema as titanic was to the winter cruise business on a positive note i like asin character dancing bharatnatyam when she changes to the western style dancing when the teacher is not looking
i don t think anyone sitting down to view this film would be expecting anything remotely appearing like a classic ghost story but you have to ask yourself when it s over if you were ever scared this doesn t really work on that level but the cast does try hard and the film doesn t tack on one of those happy endings story is about an american couple who travel to kyoto japan so that ted fletcher edward albert can write a book and he brings along his wife laura susan george and their daughter amy amy barrett their friend alex curtis doug mcclure who works at the american consulate helps them find a house to live in and he finds one that is haunted about years earlier in the same house a samurai found his wife cheating on him and he kills both of them and then commits suicide their ghosts still inhabit the house and when the fletcher s arrive it doesn t take long before strange things start happening spoiler alert at times the ghosts inhabit the bodies of the fletcher s and they start to act like the japanese people that they were before and laura starts to flirt with alex which leads to an affair meanwhile ted starts behaving more strict and after he pours soup down the throat of amy he goes to ask a monk for help unfortunately the ghosts get ted laura and alex to play out their death scene like it happened years earlier this film was directed by kevin connor who is known as a good television director but he has made horror and science fiction films before and has worked with mcclure on some of them while this never comes close to being scary or developing atmosphere it does have two things in it that i liked first it doesn t have one of those sappy endings where the couple embrace after defeating the demons instead it ends in a very bloody fight where everyone succumbs to the evil of the ghosts secondly it has susan george in the cast i ve always been a fan of hers even though she has appeared in mostly schlock but her performances are always top notch also she usually appears nude which she does here in two separate scenes and while she doesn t have classic features she does have a unique tomboy like look about her and it s one of the reasons why she was so popular but after appearing in silly films such as this i think it led to her getting out of the business or working only sporadically this isn t a bad film but it s never convincing and watching the ghosts scurry around when the monk gives an exorcism is practically worthy of a giggle or two the bottom line is that this is silly and i hope george decides to resume her career
saw this late one night on cable at the time i didn t know that the girl billed as shannon wilsey was actually porn star savannah but she was so beautiful and got naked so often thank god that i actually sat through this brain rotting drivel i like cheesy flicks as much as the next guy more than the next guy actually but this was way beyond cheesy and more into rancid the truly annoying overacting by the mad scientist and the director s writers and special effects people s virtually total incompetence detracts from the gratuitous nudity that is the movie s only saving grace savannah before she turned into the plasticized barbie doll she became as a porn queen is really interesting to watch she s drop dead gorgeous bursts into uncontrollable giggling at times glances off camera and laughs and just generally seems to be having a really good time which is more than can be said for the audience for even though savannah and her colleagues spend a fair amount of this picture naked it still can t hide the fact that this is an incredibly stupid badly made and annoying movie if you know someone who has it on video or if it comes on cable some night check it out but don t waste your money on a rental
many days after seeing conceiving ada i am still in awe that any group of people would spend so much time to make such an atrocious film no one ought see this film in hopes of learning anything of consequence about ada lovelock her colleagues or the product of her endeavors likewise no one ought to see this film in hopes of being entertained as a sci fi film this would unquestionably be a horrendous failure somehow the main character manages to bring the past to life and interact with it on her personal computer with the advice and encouraging words of timothy leary i doubt anyone could suspend their disbelief enough to keep this from seeming absolutely absurd as a drama film this would unquestionably be a horrendous failure somehow the writer director manages to fill eighty five minutes with constant unnecessary annoying and trivial drama over essentially nothing i doubt that anyone could feel that all the drama in the film serves only as an irritating distraction i find it difficult to fully express my degree of contempt for conceiving ada the circumstances under which i saw it forbid me from leaving the theater but there is no question that i would have otherwise i am still angry that i wasted the time that it took to see it only that i might more effectively criticize this movie i wish that i were more articulate
usually i don t think hollywood productions are fit to be called film so i call them movies instead but this piece of elephant manure is not even fit to be called a movie hence the quotes in the title where shall i start if this isn t the start of geriatric casting it sure is the epitome of it stefanie powers is supposed to play someone even less than half her age she s supposed to play an year old and she is forty effing two a horrible and stupid mindless portrayal of paris and france where we see clich characters such as the sympathetic grumpy shop owner the bitchy queen of models the fairy god mother ex queen of models etc this film is surpassed only in this respect by the da vinci code which reviewers correctly determined was a comedy it s highly and utterly ridiculous to have no nudity in a film about a time and a place where nudity was so common place especially if the whole focus is about that the horrible accents the nana mouskouri elevator music i could go on but i think this is enough and i was able to make these observations after watching this crap for just half an hour while surfing the internet and talking to my friends about math equations i mean i invite everyone to add to my list p d
this movie could have been great cause its got a somewhat fascinating premise but it never rises above sheer caricature the acting is severely flawed and there were moments where i cringed so severely that i thought i was going to fall of my seat in the theater never and i mean never watch this godawfull piece of danish cinema has been getting a lot of good pr the recent years but if this piece of crosses the border i m afraid nobody sane will ever want to rent a danish movie this movie is the reason why i chose to register here i really felt i needed to steer people away from this piece of my sympathies go out to the people who already went to the cinema to watch this
this movie has some of the most awesome cars i ve ever seen in a movie and definitely the hottest women but i would have to say it is still one of the worst movies i ve ever seen here is the plot and if you read it with a little inflection you have the acting as well beginning bring in characters hot woman singing obvious lip sync music agent or producer comes in thinks that she is awesome asks her to race she turns down too many bad memories flash to war hero back from war has several fights and becomes movie hero with attitude that he is better than everyone drive off in fast exotic car brother races then dies hero to avenge death cut away to getting weapons from friend you have never seen this friend before or after but seems to really care about him are you sure you want to do this yes i mean are you really sure yes give me weapons are you really sure yes ok i guess i can t talk you out of it be careful man i love you now he goes to blow up his uncles house who owned the car his brother drove finds woman decides to rescue her she drives off and he doesn t finish killing his uncle now there will be a race to finish the movie oh yeah need to throw in one more scene with bad people coming in to beat up people that don t really matter but maybe it adds a little plot race is not even that exciting of course it ends with two cars racing and one that should win throws in a surprise ending ok i just saved you you can send all of your money to me because i should have given you the same amount of enjoyment as this movie does don t get me wrong the cars are awesome and nadija is beautiful but it is truly an awful movie
most of what has been said about the negative aspects of the film hold true but if i have to sit through a movie were the directordirector of photographyeditorcan t even miss the darn microphone boom popping in and out of the movie for almost every chapter of the movie how can i enjoy and concentrate on the story as well as believe in the darn thing when i m reminded of the technicalities of making a movie wait for the dvd or don t bother

i saw this obvious schlock fest on a video store shelf and before i got my first vcr i figured i d christen it with this little gem and it s bad film making at it s finest the dialog is inadvertently hilarious and it contains a cameo with donald trump anthony quinn is in it inexplicably and much like christopher walken seemed to want to star in every bad movie in his later years this movie is mr quinn s country bears it features lines like shut up and let me fight and you re saying a lot of sh it and the priceless comeback unfortunately it is sh it tough angry sh it you ll be awed by a fight scene as bo does a sommersault across a billiard table and does a nice kung fu kick when she comes up from the roll chop socky action and t and a thrills what schlock movie fan could ask for more oh and when mr quinn s character commits suicide and and comes back to haunt bo as a ghost she asks him why he killed himself rather then deal with his debilitating illness he says real men don t eat quiche uh aaa yeah if bo was a smart cookie she woulda called for an exorcist right then and there
remade today this film would be a very creepy very disturbing dark comedy stalking obsession and a web of lies and manipulations are given a gloss of aren t they cute harmlessness drake plays the stalker an unabashed user of people alternately pathetic and manipulative grant plays the stalking victim alternately angry and oblivious vastly disturbing i haven t been able to look at classic romances with the same suspension of disbelief since
this movie is so stupid it simply goes around the corner and becomes ridiculous i wanted to watch darkness falls actually and thought that this was the movie boy what a mistake i fast forwarded as much as i could and still i couldn t get rid of the boring moments i just envy the people who was paid to play in or work on this movie they were actually given money for this crap isn t that amazing i mean in this movie a man gets killed and chopped in a wood grinder to little bloody pieces and few minutes later the mother and the kid talk calmly at the table as nothing happened and drink coffee please come on who gives money for such crap movies oh and the tooth fairy was lame not scary at all and was obvious that it is a bored stuntman wearing a badly made make up
intensive care by dorna von rouveroy is easily one of the worst horror movies ever made this extremely cheap dutch slasher flick offers some gore and plenty of absurd situations a horror veteran george kennedy is completely wasted as as professor bruckner the acting is abysmal the action is slow and the climax is laughable a famous surgeon has a car accident he lies in a coma seven years and then he wakes up and goes on a bloody rampage intensive care is clearly influenced by american slasher films including halloween and friday the th series the killings are hilarious and the dialogs are painfully stupid still if you are in the right mood you can give this piece of trash a look you ll laugh until it hurts with this one you can believe me
despite a decent first season this series never came close to realizing its potential set as a prequel to the original star trek series it was doomed almost from the start by an executive producer rick berman who felt compelled to artificially limit and constrict the definition of what a star trek series could be which made this futuristic show increasingly anachronistic from a dramatic standpoint the actual show runner brannon braga didn t help matters by his uninspired and tired rehashing of previous trek episodes and careless disregard of the franchise s internal mythology it was painfully obvious early on that he was in it only for the paycheck never have i seen a series that so consistently did a disservice to a cast of talented actors jolene blaylock excepted last so long it is as if this entire series was produced in bubble existing outside the contemporary television landscape where the audience even a trekker audience is more demanding and sophisticated in their dramatic wants and desires unfortunately it appears as if berman and braga have succeeded in convincing the higher ups at paramount that enterprise suffered from franchise fatigue and that its core audience was did not walk away but was driven off produce a quality offering that lives up to the high ideals and standards of its predecessors and they the audience will come simply put in a teevee universe where we are given shows like battlestar galactica and the shield the powers that be must give the viewing public a star trek that measures up and is dramatically competitive it is just that straightforward and easy
st watched out of dir harold young the rd universal mummy movie is about the same as the first two as far as the final result from the viewer s perspective the story is similar and the results are ho hum this time the story s location is the u s as the egyptian priest s new follower sends a mummy to our country in hopes he can revive him to kill descendants of those who opened the original tomb this time the mummy is played by lon chaney which doesn t make much of a difference because he s really not asked to do much acting for this character the new priest becomes a morgue keeper in the town and sends the mummy out to do his dirty deeds after feeding him the tanna leaf juice again a girl gets in the way as the priest falls for one of the descendent s fianc and wants her yes to be immortal with him haven t we heard this before the plan is of course thwarted as the townsfolk hunt down the mummy with torches similar to the frankenstein monster and the burning of the creature ends the story how do they get a sequel i guess you ll find out with the next one in the series or not
i saw this movie years ago in a group tradition of fast forward film festivals where we would set out to rent a bunch of b movies and vote for who picked the worst the night we watched this it was voted the best due to semblance of plot and fun costuming this is certainly a silly kitschy movie to be watched under the full understanding that you are watching low budget fluff personally however i wouldn t recommend additional substances this movie will leave it s own mark on you it made enough of an impression on me that i ve actually been trying to get my hands on a copy for a few years a good choice if you are setting out to watch bad movies this one is fun and i remember bouncy music
this picture started out with good intentions bacon the scientist out to test the theory of invisibility and shue is cute as usual in her role it all falls apart after that it s your typical hollywood thriller now filmed on a soundstage with special effects galore minus any kind of humour wit or soul in other words don t waste your time watching this get the audiocassette tape with john delancie as the invisible man instead also starring leonard nimoy now that was good and hg wells is well served unlike with this mess
buck s role as the kahn brings to mind bob barker of the price is right running a country the same way he runs his show but there s lots more to chuckle and snort through in this turkey kurt thomas as the baby faced hero displays some considerable acrobatic skills but not a whit of acting talent whatsoever there s a few spooky moments in the village of crazies mostly and some mildly impressive martial arts sequences but any given ninja movie will give you much more entertainment and you won t feel as guilty about laughing
when anti bush jokes get really easy to do a show like this had better make sure it has something extra when that something extra is kid versions of political figures making jokes about the future they don t have yet it s just plain nonsense dick cheney and george bush are done well but dick cheney mutters mostly there s also condoleeza rice who has a crush on bush for some reason and donald rumsfeld who isn t really that similar to donald rumsfeld at all the democratic characters rarely give their names so it s a mystery as to who could be who aside from barack obama and hilary clinton the episodes have coherent stories but that s not nearly enough to keep this from sinking
this comedy has some tolerably funny stuff in it surrounded by a lot of unfunny stuff just about every scene involving the servants of the castle and their silly antics is a waste of time and the plotting is so sloppy that it makes you wonder if they actually had a script ready before they started filming this or they were simply making it all up as they went along
i do not know if this movies problems are more the fault of direction or script as you will see in many reviews the editing style is way overdone it is absolutely distracting and without substance which could be considered a good thing if you look at some of the quotes from the movie i do not write many reviews here but felt this movie was so awful that it deserved comment movies like this erode at movie making as an art form movies like this one show more and more clearly that the current reality focus in cinema is revealing the quality of the characters behind them people hone there craft there senses and there business sense overlooking there own inner life however i do not put blame on them it is more and more the unfortunate condition of this age qualified by films like this one but by proxy these manufacturers i would dare not call artists vomit there lack of inner life or regard onto the screen diffusing it to everyone a story of bounty hunters guns guns and more guns heavy handed flaunting of sex for the oh so popular actress did they write the lap dance scene after they signed her over saturated over exaggerated one liners non linear plots all different and yet all the same annoying overwhelming music to push the emotion down your throat a story a development of character or just withheld missing information revealed at the end to create the effect of a story as if one took place it altogether lacks anything remotely resembling subtlety it is a caricature of stereotypes and genre where are the films with awareness what about subtlety of sound and music that you are not even aware is there what about the depth of a look what about editing with a point about mind and consciousness yes even in action films this can happen sure they have honed a craft but what use is it without soul or wisdom of insight into the human condition can the people who commented and said that this is an apogee of art or compare this to picasso and others i say put this next to gandhi or the godfather even the original trilogy of star wars or the lord of the rings then look me in the face and say it again it is a good crew but they need some help with depth and story i hope they get it because i like the crews previous work better luck next time
how low can someone sink while trying to recapture an old glory st hf will be glad to show you if you are used to seeing what made for a good star trek show do not watch this the writing is hodge podge the actors portrayals of their characters weak and most of all the design work is downright doggy like watching strong captains don t look here like the strong federation attitude forget about it here starfleet is mocked by ensigns wearing spikes in their hair while a seemingly mentally feeble captain shuffles about and within two minutes of the opening show s credits ensign spikey is attempting to arrange a tryst with an engineer it just degrades from there no not even uniforms match for goodness sake they are too small or too big collars down to their chests and tng seasons one and two uniforms mixed in with season three and ds uniforms the strict discipline and tradition of any of the originals in lacking in this production down to the treads the only good thing about this show is its graphics which seem to improve a bit with each season ok i take that back who uses cg that inexpertly the designers of this show don t bother with it it will offend your star trek sense as it did mine not even the throw backs to previous shows can save this catastrophe i wept openly when i watched this probably because my eyes were bleeding and my head almost ruptured that bad
any movie with national lampoon in the title is absolutely guaranteed to die a death in london england paris france rome italy and anywhere in germany it may be an institution in the u s but it is practically unknown in europe to the larger audience national lampoon s european vacation is unlikely to rectify that situation the appalling griswalds are just that appalling they are not funny clearly mr chevy chase thinks he s funny after all miss b di angelo laughs a lot at his jokes but she s getting paid for it and didn t have to fork out for the privilege the section set in england is typical the same old same old tv performers messrs idle smith coltrane miss m lippman trot out the same old same old tired clich s mr chase gets lost in the hotel corridor yawn yawn yawn bucking ham palace big ben i feel cheated that we never saw bobbies on bicycles two by two rosie red cheeks on the little chil dren need i go on the english are buffoons the french vicious tongued yank haters the germans pompous and puffed up don t mention the war clark and the italians lecherous bottom pinchers have i forgotten anything every possible comic situation is worked to death mr chase gurns desperately miss di angelo dimples sweetly the children are embarrassingly bad the fact that this franchise ran as long as it did must bring comfort to those who propound that you never lose money by underestimating public taste
yay i think it s hard to say it s hard to have an emotion about a movie that has no emotion this movie is as sterile as a surgeon s scalpel for a setting it has a few stone pillars some stone seats a couple stone crosses and some stone actors they have no emotion the only thing that saves this movie is the fact that it is hamlet and hamlet is a terrificly written piece of literature the dubbing really wasn t all that bad though the voices stuck true to the dull gloomy dreary life sucking atmosphere the movie gave forth i have seen this version of hamlet on the fabulous mystery science theater three times and each of the three times i was on the brink of turning off the tv despite it being mst k not an uplifting production of a drama that deserves so much better
terrible film with frank sinatra as tony rome here he gets involved with a dead woman below the sea rome is soon hired to find out what happened to a woman naturally it s the woman below the sea her room mate lainie kazan soon winds up dead on the floor an aging richard conte plays a police officer and friend of rome when a local club owner gets killed the blame falls on rome and there becomes an interesting chase scene that s how bad this picture is if you have to depend on a chase scene to supply the action raquel welch plays the beauty up to her neck in intrigue her acting leads a lot to be desired martin gabel is a retired hoodlum whose son is trying to outdo him by the film s end you don t know why the girl was murdered don t even bother to ask
this movie is terrible but it has some good effects
jack black s character tim dingman the dreamer in envy finds wealth and success in the idea of a aerosol spray vapoorize that when sprayed on doggie dung makes the poo disappear into thin air for a moment i was hoping that vapoorize was a real product so that i could spray it on this stinker of a movie and make it disappear into thin air as well although envy is not the worst movie that i have seen in the past months that honor goes to the cat in the hat it does get the honor of a close second not funny not sad not anything a real stinkeroo a out of
they are among us is poor science fiction at best mediocre acting bogs down this film the plot holes are numerous aliens that somehow came to earth on a meteor and have been hiding among us for over years but need a plastic surgeon to make them appear human in their alien form they supposedly have exo skeletons which is why they need the plastic surgery but when you see them they have teeth and fingernails the heroine s father disappeared after project blue book closed but was supposedly an f pilot and on and on if you want to see an alien invasion movie pick invasion of the body snatchers and see how it is done right
i have to confess that i am severely disappointed this version can in no way compete with the version of the reason why i watched it was that i wasn t entirely happy with ciaran hinds as captain wentworth and thought that rupert penry jones looked much more like the captain i had imagined when i read the book and he was too unfortunately that is the only redeeming quality of the film the rest is as un austen like as possible miss elliot would never have run through the streets of bath like this it wasn t in her character and it just wasn t done by a lady of the those times the anne elliot of the book was a lady and she had dignity there are other painful anachronisms but this was the worst although there are important quotes from the book they are at entirely inappropriate moments warning those who know the book that yet another important part of the book will either be missing or completely changed and although this version is not much shorter than the other one it feels like everything is rushed very little care was taken to introduce the characters show their dispositions and motives important scenes were omitted how could they possibly have butchered the final scenes in this way a disaster and it was by far not as beautifully photographed as the other one no no no if you love austen then don t waste your time with this
despite some moments in heavy rain an encounter with a drunk as well as an organ grinder with a gypsy and a monkey and a stay in a sanitarium this roscoe fatty arbuckle silent comedy short with support from buster keaton and al st john is only fitfully amusing though there is a quite funny sequence of arbuckle in drag flirting with buster that s the ultimate in meet cute scenes especially since it s one of the few times we see the great stone face smile and laugh in the movies also many scenes seem to have been jump cut edited possibly because of overuse of the film stock still if you re an arbuckle or keaton completist good night nurse is certainly worth a look
yeah i saw the rough cuts the unedited sex scenes the dire cut scenes almost on a par with the film the need for awful acting this movie is as bad as bad films get the bad script bad acting bad effects bad locations bad stunts bad everything the best actors in the film were the lap dancers they hired for the vampire extras sean harry the foppish actor as someone else put it makes a matchstick look talented here his amazing ability to badly drive a car when it is obviously being shook by people on the bonnet check out the reflection in the windscreen his inability to turn left which is class oh and don t forget the sex scene plus his noteworthy use of a toy gun which the props guys couldn t even be bothered to disguise as a real gun the other actors on screen could barely deliver their lines it was as if half the time they were waiting for a line that wasn t there the special effects were soooo good to the point that the guys who did it took their real names off the credits if you want a laugh at a party then rent this movie then again there are plenty of good comedies that are just as funny and don t give money to people who don t deserve it
i have seen it it s not good but interesting in an understated way the boys in it are quite naturalistic but the graphic gratuitous final gang rape scene is repugnant and oh yes the arbitrary insertion of second world war footage is offensive in the way it attempts to compare real horror with this misogynistic contrivance real atrocity is real this film is just atrocious however the film has a look which can draw you in but it seems to me that is the emperor s new clothes but in fact in reverse the film looks good but the direction story content and final feeling you take away from this film is vacuous if a feeling can be vacuous this is it
to not live in montana and especially not to live there at the end of the th century a river runs through it certainly is a well made movie from a cineastic stand point great landscapes redford acting well unfortunately the story is bad if there is a story at all i felt sorry for the narrator author who is as dry narrow minded a character as his father a preacher being driven not driving his own life he is left to watch his brother who is also caged in the small town environment losing his life the author never even comes close to undestand his brother s motivations but at least realizes that he is lacking the slightest amount of homour fun all there is is fly fishing where he follows even as an old man the style of his father the end is not surprising it is forseeable from the very beginning definitely not a must see
advertised by channel seven in australia as the untold story this miniseries undoes itself in the first five minutes by washing over the titular character s childhood and adolescence in less time than a good director will use to set up a single event this cowardice and self censorship for the fear of offending anyone permeates the series and is ultimately responsible for its failure robert carlyle puts in a valiant performance as the most hated man of the twentieth century but he is hamstrung by two things the lack of a decent dialogue coach on the series leaves his northern uk heritage shining blindingly through his physical appearance and the dialogue is at times truly abysmal apparently acknowledging the fact that hitler was raised in a catholic family is off limits but insulting millions of vikings and their descendants by having carlyle spew the most ridiculous lines about valhalla is quite okay well here s a clue for the writers any person familiar with viking mythology will tell you that valhalla is about the embodiment of honour and might in battle two things that the nazis quickly eschewed in favour of rat cunning and backstabbing until we can wake up to ourselves and realise that the reason hitler has never been excommunicated from the catholic church is because it would require the embarassing acknowledgement that he was once a member we will never learn what this awful period of the world s history has to teach us so now that we ve managed to insult vikings and the citizens of scandinavian countries in this sham you d think the series would stop there but it doesn t stockard channing s listing in the opening credits was particularly eyebrow raising given that her voice is heard and her face seen for about thirty seconds at the most during the opening credits making it patently transparent that more footage of hitler s early days were shot but not included because of a typical nanny state fear of offending someone it is also quite ironic that the films or miniseries which give a far better insight into hilter s character do not feature him at all until we learn to stop sugar coating the truth and realise that the citizenry of germany was mostly unopposed to hitler s views and not necessarily through ignorance we will never learn to deal with the fact that subversions of democracy yes germany was a democracy pre hitler can occur anywhere we are doomed that s the one thing this mini series got right in portraying unfortunately that element is lost in attempts to make hitler s religious beliefs appear those of a much more valiant people and the inability to scratch past the surface in any part of the subject matter david letterman s show had it pegged when they ran short satirical segments about the series they really might as well have made a family sitcom with him as the star that s how badly it was written all in all this politically correct farce of a bio pic is worth no points but i gave it two because robert carlyle definitely deserves better material than this and he is about the only thing in it that works
tv movie about an ancient egyptian curse brought to the us in the s during the filming of demille s first version of the commandments and which is reawakened when demille s sets are unearthed in the desert one of the worst films i ve seen in a long time the question is were the filmmakers serious or kidding when they made this film if this is serious its a laughably bad movie and a great film to pick on for its badness if its a comedy its less good but funny for all of the wrong reasons you will laugh long and hard at this film probably more than many other hollywood comedies
spoilers will be in this the movie could have been better if they had just had a different script director and cgi provider not much right the movie has a man starting his own theme park err zoo on a deserted island where people can see dinosaurs err sabretooths and it is called jurra oops primal park i do not mind rip offs because there are no original ideas for these kind of movies but this one just slaps you in the face with it r e p e a t e d l y there is even the creature s shadowed head on the design thing the sabretooths that are not sabretooths according to mr primal park just ancient killing cats are rather junky but the crowning accomplishment is the one i call sloggy because after disposing of one big cat a hero is relaxing a little because there is only one left enter the weird feeding guy who says nah we made three the third being a monster who pulls itself around with its front feet great groovy a group of college students are also on the island for a scavenger hunt there test to get into their cliques frat or sort always thought that needed a short nickname out of the ones who do live only one has completed their task so i got a kick out of that oh yeah the mandatory evil capitalist must die clique is in force with not one but two of them mr primal park s death is the most laughable thing you will see in one of these movies as a sabretooth statue s tooth jars loose courtesy of sloggy shrinks a few sizes and impales the man through the throat if i had only gotten away so easy i like sabretooth better than this spin off
if you like movies about creepy towns hotels houses states ala the eagles hotel california etc that possess the people that are just passing through read almost any stephen king novel instead if you like the setting of disappearance start by reading king s desperation but also check out the shining salem s lot and needful things the crow motif the desert the family driving in desperation to escape or avoid possession are tired why didn t they just make the film from the desperation novel maybe they approached king and he nixed must be susan dey and harry hamlin look happy to be reunited and they have both worn well over the years but they re still tv and direct to dvd caliber actors
man this gets a lot of good reviews in the review books frankly i found it too slow and unappealing right from the start i kept waiting for it to pick up a little steam but that never happened this movie is vastly overrated shakespeare with the king james english has never appealed to me anyway so it may just be me there is a fair share of the latter in the first half of the film as they show ronald colman playing the role of othello the good points of the film include thanks to a restored print some decent cinematography and a young slim and attractive shelly winters overall this is simply too boring too much repetition in some of the scenes to watch again besides we all know that most actors are nut cases anyway but kudos to hollywood for demonstrating it here in this story
yes this movie has kids going to space camp and it starts out okay enough as you have the kids meeting one another and learning the ropes then they introduce jinx a robot that could not possibly exist in as they do not have anything with that kind of artificial intelligence now kid becomes buddy with robot and robot repays the kid s kindness by shooting him and a group of other kids in this camp into outer space with a very limited oxygen supply and radios that do not have the signal to reach into space this camp is also not very fun as these kids are put to real training and the instructors get all over them for failing missions or not doing the right things give it a rest they are there for fun not to become astronauts just yet just give them the experience of space flight not a military like camp however you do get to see joaquin phoenix in a fairly early role so in the end a movie that tries to be realistic in some areas but with the introduction of jinx and other factors you might as well had the kids battle space aliens on top of everything else that was happening in the movie as that would have made the movie a bit more enjoyable at least for me probably for a few others as well who else would like to see kate capshaw s face ripped apart by some strange super alien creature
this show stinks for parents they usually want their kids to watch something good for them it is usually educational funny and bright is it educational no the doodlebops sing and that s it they usually sing about themselves they don t try teaching anything is it funny no the doodlebops instead say something which is not intended as a joke and laugh at it is it bright it s so bright it s painful as far as color s everything is extremely bright so that s good but nothing is ever wrong in the world of the doodlebop s therefore they are always happy a kid in trouble will become depressed because they have never been exposed to being sad the show is also extremely cheesy every syllable is said to the highest level of exaggeration and very corny it s overkill for kids it s entertaining but past the age of you won t want your kids to see it they ll never know how to grow up
an interesting concept vampirism having something to do with a virus but done several times by now overall the movie is too long and drags a bit the editing could have been tighter i am sorry to hear about the problem with the credits maybe the movie was rushed to market the lighting was too dark in places but the worst technical problem is the audio the level was good enough to hear the dialog but many of the interiors have a echo sound to them which is very distracting either they were not careful in the recording or the sound mixing could have been better also too much background noise got through the should have gotten someone to do sound effects for the martial arts scenes the tinny clank of swords hitting together was not the sound of an epic battle especially in the combat scenes the editing needed to be tighter also the acting was a bit flat i am sorry but when i see that the same person writes and stars in a movie in my experience it is a red flag but it was a good effort so i gave it a
a cannibalistic backwoods killer is on the prowl and two bickering couples might be his next source of protein in this bargain basement friday the th clone cheapie there s literally nothing of interest to see in this one the killings are surprisingly sparse and when they do happen completely amateurish it also adds ghosts into the mix for no reason what so ever i felt drained after watching it as if my brain was liquefying and draining out my nose and it remains without a doubt donald jones worst movie if you re thinking of renting it because of code red s snazzy new dvd re release don t bothermy grade f
the plot of house of games is the strongest thing about it a successful author and psychologist is conned by a gang of grifters but in discovering the wicked part of herself that enjoys the thrill of what they do she finally gets her revenge that s about the pitch but someone has to take responsibility for it coming across as being acted by puppets it has to be the director mamet lindsay crouse has had a varied and pretty steady tv and film career so she can t perform this badly all the time she s supposed to go from uptight cool controlled professional to calculating wicked fast lady having fun as shown by the change from beige trouser suit which she seems to wear for three days straight including underwear to floppy floral sundress but everyone seems to be speaking their lines the same clipped precise way i imagine mamet wanting to make sure not a syllable of his scintillating script got missed the effect is unsettling and spoils the atmosphere of mystery and suspense he is presumably trying to create at times house of games loses any connection to how human beings actually behave or talk and becomes just a mechanism to spin out the plot the clunky vibes n oboe faux jazz soundtrack doesn t help either the ultimate result is that the only entertainment to be had is in guessing the outcome and the sooner you do that the sooner you will get bored with the robotic two dimensional performances and they smoke too much
this movie is similar to darkness falls and the boogeyman but it s also much more graphic than both and not as good as either it s also slow and fairly predictable it s also got shades of deliverance and the amityville horror plus we get some new age flavour thrown in the mix and some of those scenes come off as a motivational inspirational sermon really this movie is a hodgepodge of almost everything even though it is gory the makeup effects are not very realistic looking in fact they look kinda cheap aside from all that there is some really awful clich d dialogue and i won t say when but there is a point where a couple of the character s actions were not authentic or believable given the circumstances nobody in their right mind what would have acted this way once you watch the movie you ll know what i mean there s also some gratuitous nudity for nudity s sake it just wasn t necessary at all the good news is that the acting was actually pretty good better than this movie deserves so after carefully weighing the evidence id say this movie was passable but not good my verdict for the tooth fairy
i m always suprised on how different all people are and how for almost every movie you get both extremes people who think it s the best movie and people who think it s the worst stigmata wouldn t be the worst movie i ve ever seen but it s up there first of all the sound the producers spent more time on the soundtrack than the editing it was so loud when the soundtrack was playing and no one was talking and then when patrica was talking in her monotone voice she could hardly be heard i usually like patrica and gaberial but they were both flat in this movie patrica had basically emotions quiet in great pain or really angry she has stigmata the first was the predominate one the second involved screaming pain the third involving raising her voice it was loudness that distiguished the three and not emotion maybe i missed a lot of the deep meaning and subplots everyone was talking about or maybe i was distracted by the terrible filming and mtv like style when you watch a minute video you need fast cuts and slow motion to convey a quick story in a hour feature film it s nauseating i fail to see the meaning of her seeing that women across the steet and dropping a child and no pittsburg does not rain that often i think maybe a real story with something to say could have been intended but all the budget was spent on buying music and the equipment to do slow rain drop shots and renting that gorgous apartment that ms arquett lived in that they ended up firing the guy with the story
a small time hood tricks the local mob boss out of a lot of money of course the mob boss wants his money back and doesn t care who he has to kill to get it the punk enlists his friend and an old mobster to help him save his life if this sounds ridiculous it is the whole idea that this izod wearing dune buggy driving punk could hold off one of the most powerful mobs in rome is just plain silly his friend may be good with a gun but he s up against a group of trained killers the old mobster is little more than comic relief and no real help when it comes to the face off with the mob there s also a sub plot about how the friend s father was killed years ago by the mob boss but there s little made of it and it doesn t help the movie any at all the mob boss mister scarface is played by jack palance i suppose he got the name because he has what looks like a shaving nick on his cheek palance is as ineffective as the rest of the cast doing what he must to get a paycheck i ve seen some pretty good italian crime cop flicks recently but mister scarface isn t one of them check out syndicate sadists or revolver instead
i watch lots of scary movies or at least they try to be and this has to be the worst if not nd worst movie i have ever had to make myself try to sit through i never knew the depths of masacism until i rented this piece of moldy cheese covered in a used latex contraceptive i am a fan of julian sans but this is worse than i would hope for him on the other hand the story was promising and i was intrigued for the first minute and a half while the credits rolled and i had yet to see what pain looked like first hand perhaps there are some viewers out there that enjoyed this and can point me in the right direction but then again i know of those viewers who understand if not commemorate me especially when we had to turn the video off and that simply is not done with our watching we had to make one exception obviously if it were up for a remake i d give it a chance so long as they had at most of the original incorporated into it that s all
the direction had clearly stated that this film s idea and plot is totally original however as to those who have read slam dunk comic we can clearly see that the characters are very similar and even some jokes another note is jay chow himself do not know kung fu it just won t impress anyone if he tries to act like he can many people today can see the differences luckily the movie do not contain much of kung fu fighting and much are enchanced by stunners and visual effects i think that jay s acting is still a pain to watch especially when almost everyone else in the film is so much better the only reason i think why jay is the main actor is simply is for his popularity despite how hard i wish to stop anyone from watching this thus making this orginal movie getting what it shouldn t have it has became one of the best budget films in china for this year
i would of given this film a zero out of ten but i will give it a two reason one is that shah rukh khan appears in the film which is not really a reason last point is that rani appears in this film and does a smooch with kamal i love rani very much and have a respect that she is a great actress which is why i didn t enjoy her in this movie kissing kamal but its no big deal anyway enough of the bedroom scenes that made this film noticeable lets actually talk about this film is it good or bad i think its a completely rubbish movie that made me yawn me being a fantastic critic you can see my other review s by clicking on my name i have great taste the movie is not entertaining is one thing and if this is suppose to be hard hitting cinema why is there no morale in this movie its a biased movie thats not a true story and it stinks watching kamal kissing these actresses makes me sick man cant kiss properly anyway
a typical lanza flick that had limited audience appeal with a weak story line that was put together simply to justify lanza s mgm contract at the time as reported by member lastliberal above grayson could not stand lanza because of his obscene advances towards her off and sometimes on camera in addition his gutter mannerism and the continual smell of alcohol in her face during scenes they did together were intolerable after doing their second and last film together toast of new orleans the normally quiet grayson stormed into louie b mayer s office and told him in no uncertain words that she would never work with lanza again period mayer felt that grayson was much more valuable to mgm then lanza so grayson s statement stuck grayson went on to star in a number of widely received and far more profitable musicals with howard keel and others later in life when asked to compare lanza and keel her reply was that there was no comparison between them and that keel was great to work with and had much more appeal to the real people in the audiences
very badly made film the action violence scenes are ridiculous point for the presence of burton and mastroianni point for the real tragic event of the massacre of the innocent italians
worst mistake of my life i picked this movie up at target for because i figured hey it s sandler i can get some cheap laughs i was wrong completely wrong mid way through the film all three of my friends were asleep and i was still suffering worst plot worst script worst movie i have ever seen i wanted to hit my head up against a wall for an hour then i d stop and you know why because it felt damn good upon bashing my head in i stuck that damn movie in the microwave and watched it burn and that felt better than anything else i ve ever done it took american psycho army of darkness and kill bill just to get over that crap i hate you sandler for actually going through with this and ruining a whole day of my life
this movie had what sounded like a good premise people facing their fears to win one million dollars unfortunately it did not turn out to be a good movie there are several scenes that are way too long and really pointless like the dancing scene a few scenes are just an excuse to point the camera at female body parts the acting is bad but some of the lines are amusing in their awfulness what s really strange is that towards the end of the movie it turns into like a minute western and at the end the twists of which their were several don t make sense with the rest of the movie it seemed as though the director just added stuff on because he thought it would look cool while conveniently ignoring the plot of the movie up to that point it just didn t make a lot of sense the only creepy thing was the old people dancing down the hall but that doesn t even come close to making up for the rest of this mess
i had read a few positive reviews of this film and was truly surprised at how dreadful the whole thing was positioned as some cross between an aids related story and some kind of ghost blithe spirit tale this film can t always make it s mind up what it wants to be simon and mark are a gay couple who have an open relationship simon is able to have anonymous though safe sex on the side when he wants mark is hiv and he and simon don t seem to have a sex life anymore when mark dies simon who has made a habit of shutting off his emotions after being rejected years ago by his father tries to erase his memory and just get on with being a bachelor not that his behavior before mark s death was much different but mark returns in ghostly form and foils his various trysts while getting simon to open up and admit his true feelings unfortunately simon is such a selfish sob it s impossible to feel any empathy toward him for most of the film by the time he is supposed to be more sympathetic it s too late to care mark on the other hand follows in demi moore s footsteps from ghost by crying profusely throughout the movie there is a bizarre switch in tone after mark returns suddenly we get some lame attempts at humor a la the tv show bewitched but that doesn t last long once simon s emotional health is at stake the whole thing becomes increasingly mawkish with amateurish attempts to jerk at your heartstrings the finale with a gold plated muscle boy angel guiding a tearful mark to heaven while a chastened grief stricken simon waves goodbye is just stupefying chiefly because it isn t intentionally funny
comedy central has a habit of putting on great programs at times chappelle s show the daily show colbert report and then there are those that some people love or hate stella dr katz then there are some shows that have their defenders but are just plain awful mencia and now sarah silverman this show is based on the fact silverman is self centered which can be funny colbert report but can be horrible mind of mencia it should shock no one that i believe the latter is the case this show is a parody of a sitcom and society a program so absurd it loses itself in its absurdity and it simply isn t funny a woman farting has been done in comedy many many times because its not something that s common we don t need minutes of it when a criminal is disarmed by a queef it simply loses its appeal we saw it in jay and silent bob strike back except the women were hotter and the whole scene was more absurd making it better but the best comparison of this show is to stella except stella was more subtle which is what made the absurdist comedy funny it had better acting and i suppose a bit more of a fantastical realist view perhaps the fact some reviews are so negative i m very skeptical of the critical acclaim but do not dispute fan reaction to this show is the amount of advertising on it very obnoxious ads through many programs far outdo advertising on for other programs many people are wondering why sarah silverman has a career and others are still bitter when better shows have been canceled this show should ve never made it past the unaired pilot stage back to norm showed far more promise yet this show makes it further and as far as critics being correct many things have been universally panned have seen their status rise immensely last i checked britney spears gets good reviews too also take that comparison however you want because someone will no doubt accuse me of being psychotic on imdb for not liking this show
i purchased this movie on blu ray because it promised great visuals and music i was also a great fan of a similar movie baraka the movie is very much styled after baraka wide angles very similar shots with cameras set to capture long time passage in each shot even some of the scenes were identical the street with traffic whereas baraka told a great story juxtaposing nature man made environments spirituality and horrors of the world in an engrossing fashion and great music this movie just jumped from shot to shot with no encompassing story mediocre musical score and then poof it s finished i thought there must be some sort of mistake history of the world half the movie is egypt and landscape looks like arizona but i didn t bother to check seriously folks this is horrible rent it if you must but do not buy it the filmmakers should be ashamed of themselves for putting this out
my first question after seeing this film was why is the title liam if the intent was to tell a story from the boy s perspective it was not carried out well of course there was the formulaic use of camera angles in the boy s scenes but much of the crucial action took place outside of his field of view having a main character unable to speak obviously suggesting the mute powerless position of a child makes it difficult to give that character much depth melodrama is defined as dramatic or other literary work characterized by the use of stereotyped characters exaggerated emotions and language simplistic morality and conflict liam fits this definition to a t the viewer is hit over the head with the typical stereotypes of the fire and brimstone catholic church in the stern school marm and the well fed priest squeezing money from parishioners a stereotype which is becoming very tiresome what s more the jewish characters are money lenders and factory owners much of the film was predictable who didn t think that we d see theresa scrubbing the toilet after her mother had told her no daughter of mine will scrub another woman s toilet i m a fan of british realism if it s done well in my opinion liam is not
in what seemed like the longest hour i ve had to endure in a long time al pacino delivers an accurate performace to be sure not his usual typecasting which was nice but his character was just truely pathetic someone to pitty as he stumbles around forgetting appointments as we realise that the hollywood social life has drained him of his life energy but in this movie we needed someone to like and for some reason every character in the picture said i don t know why i like you eli to al pacino s chracter and i couldn t even come close to liking him all the other actors played their usual styles tea leoni richard schiff and bill nunn did nothing to change their established personas developed on tv or in earlier films and kim basinger wasn t even in the film long enough to deliver a performance of any kind the movie s story had no momentum most scenes never driving the story forward but rather just collecting factoids about characters which later came into play in an anti climactic ending it had potential except for their unwillingness to build upon the story whats the point of the film daniel algrant and jon robin baitz would have you believe once hollywood has you you can t get out yeah right and that s why so many people get fired in hollywood
first it takes a full half hour to get hackman out of jail and to start doing the job what a waste of time we all know hackman is getting out to do some job for his masters why waste almost a third of the movie on these sequences then hackman stays in a hotel and the story arc again goes nowhere simply proving to us that hackman is under close watch and anything he says or does is know by the masters again another minutes then more wasted time showing the reunion with his wife all of this should have taken minutes at most simply as a set up for the real action intrigue and plot twists by the time the real action gets going i was so bored that i just wanted the movie to end hackman is great as usual and the other actors as well but this is a dud of the first magnitude
a lot of horror fans seem to love scarecrows so i won t be very popular in saying that i found it to be rather boring the idea behind it was interesting but it seems to drag so much i think the main problem is that it is all set in darkness sometimes horror films set in darkness can work such as humongous but scarecrows is in darkness for the whole film a lot of the time it s hard to figure out what s actually happening and although some shots of the scarecrows were creepy most were hard to even see if a little more lighting had been used perhaps it could ve been better there s not many films involving killer scarecrows to my knowledge apart from dark night of the scarecrow which is much better i would recommend that over scarecrows any day
considering the original film version of the haunting is in my top ten films of all time i approached this adaption with trepidation i was right to be cautious as this film is a poorly written and badly executed load of old tosh all those involved should be ashamed the original was terrifying to me as a child for one reason you see nothing robert wise used innovative camera work and superb lighting to generate fear and this is why it work s the shame of the new version is that it relies on clever special effects and pyrotechnics to get from a to b sadder still is that the ingredients were there actors such as liam neeson catherine zeta jones to do something different this film should only watched as an example of studio butchery
in theodore rex poor whoopi goldberg is set up as a tough police cop who gets to work with a pathetic dinosaur on a case the movie tries to be funny and tries to make a story about abductions and more but it never works the movie is far from funny and the story is ridiculous i voted
mix exotic tropical locations babes in skimpy attire explosions good looking dudley do right clones a movie star with his best years behind him martin sheen a little martial arts and a sexy villainess tracy lor er sorry tracy elizabeth lords and you d think you d be in for some escapist fun not so this is a dreary tv movie and even though it likes to promote itself as a charlie s angels deal it is nowhere near as good as the original series or even the gawdawful irretrievably stupid recent c a movies this abomination is best described as a third rate andy sidaris film nowhere near as much fun as andy s hard ticket to hawaii although some of the fight scenes are decent enough the girls spend too much time posing and trying too look prissy and it gets annoying after a while there s better genre stuff that this out there oh yeah and the babes aren t as hot as they like to think they are terrible soundtrack when it s there
horror movie really i cant believe how bad this movie was what the point of this movie the movie almost h and min and the first minutes of it is just lena walking around with this stupid look on her face after she had an accident not much talking at all not even much actions at all i have to say tho the last minuets it got little tiny action and was still stupid and the end oh my god i don t know where to begin it also end up with this stupid look on lena face lol don t get me wrong i love lena headey i think she is great actress but i don t know what got into her to do this movie don t waste your time and watching it because this movie has no story has no acting and has no point not to mention how slow this movie goes and it feels like you been watching it forever
i recently viewed this atrocity in my film program and i thought it was awful as i said in my tagline it was pretentious trite petty and phenomenally self important i consider myself a fan of film and all the things that film has to offer if i want to watch a documentary on the cannes festival i will watch a e and they would probably be alot more objective about it i dont recommend it period
not exactly a new story line but this romantic comedy makes the concept work a young man john cusack and a drop dead gorgeous woman kate beckinsale keep meeting by chance and wonder if they are meant for each other although both are promised to others oddly enough they still feel that their soul mate is out there somewhere a little sappy in some places but viva la love being a romantic i am almost obligated to be riveted my favorite scene is where cusack is on the ground and snow starts falling the finale is almost too sweet but most deserving this is not one of cusack s deeper roles but who in the hell could not be smitten by beckinsale notable support is provided by jeremy piven and molly shannon john corbett plays the worst role i ve ever seen him in on the other hand eugene levy is quirky and funny watch this with your soul mate
fot the most part this movie feels like a made for tv effort the direction is ham fisted the acting with the exception of fred gwynne is overwrought and soapy denise crosby particularly delivers her lines like she s cold reading them off a cue card only one thing makes this film worth watching and that is once gage comes back from the semetary there is something disturbing about watching a small child murder someone and this movie might be more than some can handle just for that reason it is absolutely bone chilling this film only does one thing right but it knocks that one thing right out of the park worth seeing just for the last minutes or so
is this the worse star trek tos episode maybe at least it gets my vote as being in the bottom i mean this episode makes absolutely no freaking sense seeing something that makes you go mad give me a break this episode also has a different feel to it the music is heightened almost forced to enhance a feeling of distress to the point that it sucks give me some klingons gorns tholians romulans higher beings like triskelion s or anything but medusin s these are very boring aliens to make an episode around mccoy gets to utter his famous phrase he s dead jim spock puts on the protective goggles when transporting the ambassador away but kirk does not they go through that freaking barrier now for the third time that i can remember boring at least season three s next episodes would be spectre of the gun and day of the dove and others to follow making trek a decent show to watch in syndication where it would pick people like me up as avid fans personal observations trek loved to use the color purple its kind of a pinkish purple like when they are in the corridor outside the compartment the gangway that is normally grey is now purple we never had a purple bridge but its interesting to see i noticed it in several episodes it was done by a light filter and it works very well but in this episode in the ships corridor is pretty lame
i seems in the beginning a interesting film a spanish thriller in a interesting nowadays madrid but it isn t none of that is actually a film only interesting for future films directors learning about what not to do making a film it can t be worse in others words even the presence of a oscar winner mira sorvino isn t enough to justify the dollars expended to see this film the acting is horrendous and it seems the actors were just waiting to finish the daily shots to go home it lead to nowhere and is boring weak and bad don t expend time or money on this film
note to self just because a film is foreign obscure and stars catherine zeta jones doesn t mean it s any good such is the case with blue juice a brit flick about an unlikely group of surfing enthusiasts in what would seem to a dumb american anyway an even more unlikely place to find surfers cornwall england you might be thinking this has the makings for an amusing quirky little comedy if only the film is just a bit over ninety minutes but it seems interminable the easiest way to describe it is as a sort of s british version of grease without the dancing but even that makes it sound better than it is no the best way to take it is as a little slice of life set in a small town catherine zeta jones plays chloe a young woman living with a surfing instructor jc sean pertwee you remember him pertwee is actually the film s star and his character is something of a surfing legend to a small group of surfing devotees the requisite oddball group of free spirits that inevitably inhabit films like this in this case it consists of a drug dealer who wants to be a journalist a former nightclub dj who wants to be a record producer and a fat nerdy guy who in a needlessly extended scene gets stoned and loses all his inhibitions which of course turns out to be the best thing that ever happened to him i can t honestly say everything that goes on in blue juice is predictable since it s set in a place and reflects customs and manners i m not very familiar with but there s certainly nothing surprising or even interesting that takes place there or with the characters the comedy though is very predictable and tired one can sense the set ups a mile away and almost recite the dialogue in american form of course before the actors do the relationship between jc and chloe is every bit as hackneyed she wants him to grow up he wants them to stay the impetuous teenagers they started out being he s afraid of losing face with his gang she thinks he prefers them to her you get the idea as i struggled to stay focused on blue juice toward the end i felt as the saying goes that this was an hour and half of my life i d never get back
while it does crack the odd good joke the humour is generally quite dry with members of the panel frequently pulling faces or resorting to coarse language and waiting on the crowd to applaud lame enough jokes unlike what an other comment says i don t think this is the best rte have ever made its really dry and sarcastic sarcasm is the lowest form of wit there are few truly funny intelligent gags that would make you genuinely laugh out loud people seem to be convinced by the comedians well known names rather than by judging the quality of the gags which aren t really that good overall its mediocre with some good laughs to be had but often it can be fairly mediocre its not as good as jasper carrot or dave allens stuff i find benny hill funnier
horror sci fi that is interesting as it is laughable f x pretty good for what you manage to see a made for tv thriller that is not as bad as the worst of them jeffrey coombs plays a brilliant although misguided scientist that tampers with stem cell research and manipulates human dna with that of a hammerhead shark the horrifying results give birth to one hell of a killing machine a group of scientists led by william forsythe and hunter tylo are invited to a remote island to check out the brilliant new experiment of course after laughing and stammering in awe coombs creation by the way is his own son fused with a hammerhead is let loose to hunt down one by one his father s colleagues revenge is not always rewarding also in the cast elsie muller g r johnson arthur roberts and velizar binev
when it comes to horror movies i am more than willing to suspend disbelief ignore sub par production values and overlook plot holes in the interest of a good scare this movies simply has no good scares to offer it can t even be enjoyed as camp bad dialogue bad acting bad direction the kills were predictable and poorly staged the music was annoying the camera work was wretched even the costumes were bad i felt really bad for the actors who were obviously trying but who had to deal with terrible contrived dialogue and an obvious lack of direction i doubt they got any rehearsal either it s embarrassing to watch and so boring than making it through to the contrived surprise ending requires tremendous endurance it s quite easily one of the worst movies i ve ever seen i don t normally write reviews but this one was so bad that i felt compelled to warn others this movie is a complete waste of time if you must watch this movie don t miss the making of featurette the writer director seems to be under the impression that making the killer a woman was kind of bold daring move seen it he and the cast spend half an hour deconstructing this film as if it s a new age citizen kane it s like listening to a group of third graders take you behind the scenes of their christmas pageant they truly think they ve created something of substance it s sad really the only reason i gave this movie a is because i think should be reserved for true atrocities like manos hands of fate and space mutiny so american nightmare isn t the worst movie i ve ever seen but i d have to say that it s somewhere in the bottom fifty
aka the bloodsucker leads the dance lots of naked babes in this one with a couple of lesbo scenes thrown in the film is supposed to take place in ireland but it looks more like rome and the adriatic to me gothic lesbians get invited to a count s island castle for the weekend one by one they seem to be missing their heads due to a madperson running around it s not very scary or bloody and the rooms look like they are lit with floodlights even though candles are lit go figure sic dubbing is worse than usual and the plot only serves as an excuse for the eroticism and nudity directed by euro horror actor alfredo rizzo this is one snoozer pretty boring out of
yet another forgettable warners foreign intrigue thriller this is rendered even less enjoyable by the irritating presence of lauren bacall who without humphrey bogart s tender attentions to humanize her comes off as her usual shrill shallow self even master gigolo charles boyer cannot feign romantic interest in her
black angel is minor whodunit with june vincent as a woman trying to save her husband from the electric chair after he is found guilty of killing an old acquaintance dan duryea the husband of the murdered woman decides to help vincent find the real culprit peter lorre has one thankless role as a suspect this film noir looks and plays like a cheap programmer never achieving anything special it is pleasant enough but then at some point it stops making sense and the solution to the mystery provokes one of those big give me a break reactions that ending alone could have sank the film completely but what precedes the conclusion is not very good either vincent is a wimpy heroine and duryea was never very good at playing good guys i love film noirs but this one was a real disappointment
you ll notice that the chemist who appears in two scenes and gets to speak is played by stephen king don t give up your day job is the standard thing to say but that s not fair king acquits himself reasonably well he s no worse than any other member of the cast and better than most the story on the other hand is pure rubbish please give up your day job never have i seen so many dreadful performances of which the lead actor s the lead actor s is probably the worst gathered together in the one film everyone acts hammily but not in any entertaining way they all somehow manage to go over the top without expending or manifesting energy i blame screenwriter director tom holland it can t be that all the actors are really this bad what are the odds against that admittedly i ve never heard of any of them before but still i don t think i could walk into a talent agency and walk out with this many bad performers if i tried one actor despite my best efforts would turn out to have talent so what s more likely that tom holland rolled a dozen consecutive snake eyes or that he wrote a lousy script and then directed it poorly that would also explain why actors are bad in direct proportion to their prominence in the script the more direction an actor got the worse he performed you want me to bend over like a hunchback talk from the back of my throat show all my teeth and look bored all at the same time okay this theory is confirmed by the fact that holland undeniably managed to co write a lousy script several writers here have commented on the fact that billy halleck is not a likeable character but that s a misleading way of putting it he s not a knowable character all we find out about him before the supernatural stuff starts happening is that he s fat and that all he can think about is food all i can think about is food he tells us helpfully and in the end sigh i suppose i ought insert a spoiler warning here in the end he becomes evil why i can only shrug perhaps he s under some kind of enchantment yeah that s probably it by evil perhaps i mean inexplicable it s not so much badness as a socially undesirable suspension of ordinary means end psychology anyway his actions at the end make no sense nobody s actions make much sense and this is despite the fact that the characters do little but explain their motivation for the benefit of the audience by the way here s my nominee for hammiest line delivery i don t think you d like it in fact big dramatic pause i don t think you d like it at all
i first saw this movie when i was about years old my mom bought it at our local kmart because it was on sale for on vhs she thought that it would be a nice christmas movie for me and my brothers to watch this movie however scared the hell out of me you may be asking yourself how could a movie about santa clause scare anyone the plot of the movie revolves around satan sending one his minions pitch to earth in an attempt to kill santa and ruin christmas that s right satan sends a demon up from hell to kill santa clause pitch stalks santa throughout christmas eve in an attempt to trap him on earth when the sun rises on christmas day for if santa doesn t make it back to his home in space he turns to powder don t get me wrong the movie is funny and fairly entertaining however the image of demons and devils dancing in the depths of hell which occurs at the beginning of the movie is just downright creepy
i cant describe how terrible this movie is am i the only one here who finds the way its animated totaly disgusting the men of rohan look fake with their poorly colored hair that doesnt even come close to matching what the actors look like the orcs looked terrible why does gandalf walk with a bad limp why cant they pronounce things correctly saruman isnt aruman there were other what sounded like terrible pronounciation sp of tolkiens characters all and all im glad the studio who made this pulled the plug out from the sequal it was just a terrible terrible adaptaion go watch the hobbit cartoon for a better cartoon of tolkiens work hell even the cartoon version of rotk is better then this dribble
what do you get when you have bad acting bad directing scenes that are excruciatingly long terrible lighting painful editing and awful effects you get jessica a ghost story seems its shot on betacam which is fine but the lighting has to compliment this medium in this case it does not there are a few cu s where the person s face is entirely in shadow one scene in particular is the scene at the psychiatrists it s a joke if you ask me some of the scenes were so long that they could have easily been cut in half but i guess then they wouldn t have a film at feature length the main character is incredibly flat he s the lead male so he should have some hero elements to his character but he does not he whines and is scared the entire film i could go on but i don t want to waste my time although the lighting was terrible i must say that they did have nice camera movement too bad the lighting didn t compliment it the cover of the dvd is nice and that s where it ends just terrible
a very cheesy and dull road movie with the intention to be hip and modern shown in the editing style and some weird camera angles resulting only in sleepiness the cast is wasted the writing is stupid and pretentious the only thing worthwhile is the top notch lalo schifrin s soundtrack really cool and also the opening sequence very original and interesting run if you can the bad opinions and comments about this flick are totally deserved it is really pure garbage of course that this has its charm of watching a movie which everybody would not drop the beer glass on if it were on fire but save it for a stormy day where you have absolutely nothing else to do
power play starts off interesting but it goes down hill fast the only good actor is tobin bell and he has a very small part beyond bell power play has no redeeming value or interest power play has more earthquakes in a few days than california has in a year the earthquake scene in the mall is so contrived and completely unbelievable and all the action scenes look like a bunch of third graders putting on a play it s awful simply awful bottom line if power play was made in the s or s it would be considered a poor b class movie the fact that power play was made in is really sad is there such a thing as a d class movie if so power play casts the mold
this movie is a great example of how even some very funny jokes can go terribly wrong i really expected at least something from this movie after seeing the add which was funny as hell but the movie wasn t half as good the weird part is that the jokes are actually funny the spoofs of the smoking ban jo bole etc are genuinely good jokes but i don t know whom to blame this movie flop on the prime candidates may be the hammers actors and hammeresses actresses and not even the funny kind the director the guy who cast the actors and or the director anyway if you are really really bored and i mean really see this movie or else get a copy of each and every ad or teaser of this movie and laugh your butt of because those will be far funnier than the film p s the only saving grace of this film is mahesh manjrekar and the funny chappu bhai
i have to agree with some of the other comments and even go a step further nothing about this film worked absolutely nothing delmar our central character makes the decision to become a surrogate mother in order to earn enough money to buy a restaurant but along the way fall for a wise ex jailbird at the same time her friend hortense is trying to get her lawyer boyfriend to finally marry her she also happens to be sleeping with marlon who is desperately in love with her then there s delmar s brother jethro who gets involved with a former coke addict missy who reveals she was sexually abused by her adopted father on the sidelines we also have the eccentricmother who has an assortment of equally odd friends one of whom dies on the couch at the beginning of the film so far so good but after introducing these characters and story lines addressing life death grief and love in the first half the film simply loses direction if the writer had only selected one or two characters and allowed us to follow their stories maybe things would have been fine but equal screen time is given to all with the result that no one story or character is fully developed for instance why does delmar think she will be able to hand over her child in exchange for money especially when the prospective parents are a creepy bigoted lawyer and his semi alcoholic and depressed wife why is hortense so desperate to marry a man who is a jerk and clearly doesn t love her how is it missy manages to kick her coke habit overnight is jethro regularly drawn to women with overwhelming problems or is missy the exception has delmar and jethro s mother always been on the eccentric side or is it a more recent development why is jethro so keen on cadillacs that he has one in the middle of his living room why did moses spend years in prison for stealing a car a relatively minor crime how does delmar manage to end up giving birth to moses baby when there is no suggestion that they ever had sex these questions are posed in the screenplay but sadly are never answered i can only assume they were answered in the original novel and that is why the writer felt the need to include it all in the script big mistake losing several subplots especially the hortense and marlon story which adds nothing to the overall film would have tightened things considerably and allowed more time to develop the delmar jethro and moses characters who are clearly more central to the plot and underlying themes than anyone else add to that the most pedestrian directing style seen outside of the average soap opera and the result is a huge missed opportunity for all including jorja fox who does her best to rise above the material i m not surprised that this appears to have been the director s last film as this effort shows no evidence of a visual style or ability to tell a moving and intelligent story
flat soulless computer images on less than astonishing backgrounds animates a horribly predictable story in this film absolutely nothing takes you by surprise you can even tell when the bryan adams vocals are going to come in which are always at the wrong time the main character spirit the horse is given an annoying voice when he narrates what is happening the narration is not needed though as everything happening is really obvious you can even tell what the horses are saying although all they do is neigh which would be good but all the horses make exactly the same sounds one for warning one for sorrow one for laughing etc there is no variation between the horses voices young kids might like this film though it s soppy enough for a family to sit down and watch and there s little danger of anyone being frightened if you have nothing else to do and want to watch a film with your kids this isn t a bad choice but otherwise this isn t recommended
wow this movie bored the pants off me when i saw it bland pointless and unmoving apparently ash and co can travel through time with the help of the spirit of the forest princess mononoke much there they meet a dorky kid named sam and the plot begins so tom ash and huck sam get high with nature become hippies and try to free celebi the spirit from some weirdo hunter guy i don t even know what else went on it all went by in a blur ash s friends were hardly in it and all the fight scenes were boring after saving the day ash and his infamous friends must return to their time while watching sam float away with celebi that scene was just creepy o o then after returning to their time ash learns that his new friend is actually his rival s grandpa and i think that s it pretty retarded isn t it if you love your children you won t expose them to this out of
daraar got off to a pretty good start the first scene really left me at the edge of my seat wondering what would happen next other than that the first half of the movie is a total bore all the first half of the movie is about is rishi kapoor falling head over heels in love with juhi chawla by the way don t you think he s a little old for her things finally start to spice up towards the middle of the film when juhi tells us about her previous husband and wow what a lunatic is he he was an over protective neat freak with a really hot temper he used to beat up poor juhi for no good reason one of the reasons i really don t like this movie is because i can t stand to see juhi my favorite actress get so abused this film in general has way too much abuse and bloodshed i find it so sickening anyway all i m trying to say is if you re thinking about renting daraar you should put it right back on the shelf where you found it and pick something else
after the overrated success of amenabar and balaguero spanish horror movies spread like a disease in the increasingly sad world of horror movies the result is all in films like el segundo nombre a tv like production bad written but acted and directed even worse i didn t read the ramsey campbell book but i m sure that the author of the doll who ate its mother didn t have much in common with this terrible production avoid it at any cost unless you re searching for a quiet sleepy night in a fresh movie theater
like all cult tv shows there is a group of people who love the twilight zone so much that they rate practically every episode like they are the greatest shows ever while several of them are indeed wonderful classics the truth is for every great episode there were several that were mediocre and at least one that stank however like die hard trekkies these zone lovers insist that all of them are gold in fact this is what initially got me to review some individual episodes of a couple cult series instead of the movies i usually watch while this isn t the worst episode ever made nor is it among the very worst it is poor by any reasonable standard a widow watches a long procession of civil war soldiers going past her home in the end a very unexpected twist is revealed and there isn t a whole lot of excitement or suspense here
they played this on the july th twilight zone marathon and this is hands down the worst twilight zone episode i ve ever seen it s completely out of sync with the rest of the series in its tone even though twilight zone is a pretty uneven series and many episodes end up being groaningly predictable this one was completely out of place compare this to legendary episodes like a stop at willoughby or midnight sun and you realize there is no comparison buster keaton did what he could with such terrible material and frankly it surprises me that someone of his historic comedy stature would stoop to the level of this episode even though he seemed to be giving it some effort he must have needed the money there s no other explanation
this movie was a rather odd viewing experience the movie is obviously based on a play now i m sure that everything in this movie works out just fine in a play but for in a movie it just doesn t feel terribly interesting enough to watch the movie is way too stagey and they didn t even bothered to change some of the dialog to make it more fitting for a movie instead what is presented now is an almost literally re filming of a stage play with over the top characters and staged dialog because of all this the storyline really doesn t work out and the movie becomes an almost complete bore and obsolete viewing experience it takes a while before you figure out that this is a comedy you re watching at first you think its a drama you re watching with quirky characters in it but as the movie progresses you ll notice that the movie is more a tragicomedy that leans really more toward the comedy genre rather than the drama genre the characters and dialog are really the things that make this movie a quirky and over the top one that at times really become unwatchable sure the actors are great peter o toole and susannah york amongst others but they don t really uplift the movie to a level of watchable enough the story feels totally disorientated basicaly the story is about nothing and just mainly focuses on the brother sister characters played by peter o toole and susannah york but what exactly is the story even about the movie feels like a pointless and obsolete one that has very little to offer like i said before i m sure the story is good and interesting to watch on stage but as a movie it really isn t fitting and simply doesn t work out the editing is simply dreadful and times and it becomes even laughable bad in certain sequences more was to expect from director j lee thompson who has obviously done far better movies than this rather failed stage play translated to screen project really not worth your time
it was obvious that this movie is designed to appeal to the chick flick audience to which i have sat through quite a few and enjoyed most however this was a very irritating attempt by heather graham to become the next meg ryan who became annoying as hell in her own right her acting was overdone and it appeared that she was overanxious compared to her colleagues who were relaxed in their roles this film might have been more as there was suitable budget for settings actors and a decent story line my wife and i both agreed that this was muck at the end as the film ended on a painful embarrassing high better luck next time hope miss graham sticks to the type of films that she belongs in like from hell
i had the misfortune of wasting quid buying ss new movie on dvd attack force now i usually can suspend my belief watching films like this a pinch of salt and some beers on a dark evening on the sofa watching a noisy late evening shoot em up is perfect for a single alpha male like me i bought this film thinking i d see cool martial arts and shoot em up did i hell segal is old and bloated the plot was ludicrous even by ss standards and to cap it all off segal s acting such as it was to start with is exceptionally dire so dire in fact that half of his voice was dubbed over by a man who sounded nothing like him either ss cant act no more a moot point of the crew were so dreadful at their jobs they couldn t record the sound properly the voice would flick back and forth between mr whisper segal and the man who does voice overs for honda adverts plot wise isn t the issue because most action films work along the same premise as this one nothing new there the usual mix of characters who will die horribly as cannon fodder and stereotyped bad guys waiting to get blown away avoid this film like you would avoid walking in front of a speeding train or a dose of h n avian flu utter garbage this has been a public health warning
it was and a simpler time the seventies a simpler place san francisco where a man could make a simple movie about a drug crazed psychotic re crucifixion of christ as a woman on acid with never ending dream sequences and inter cut flashbacks while having a multi racial inter gender orgies regardless of financial responsibilities or moral repercussion this movie tedious slow boring is the worst example of the kind of pretentious heavy handed art school dreck that passed as art in the midst of the s and i love it once this train wreck of endless slow motion zoom ins and heavy reverbed echo chamber acid guitar licks starts you can t take your eyes off of it until the ridiculous and absurd end its kind of a cross between jesus christ superstar beyond the valley of the dolls and a really crappy acid trip with your parents on a water bed its simultaneously a train wreck completely fascinating and also a great snapshot of the worst or best elements of b grade seventies phychadelic film genre the plot i ll just tell you the plot because you will hardly be able to tell whats happening due to the constant cross edited flashbacks to events that may or may not have happened to characters that may or may not be themselves and the face painted hippy freak nicks endlessly cavorting about in banal sequences of performance art level mime like street theater logan is a really annoying iconoclast film maker who yells at people allot and is surrounded by a mostly silent film crew who are always dropping acid and having what seem like really bad orgies richard dreyfus has an ancillary role as what seems like the accountant the film crew seems to hate him for some reason and break out into maniacal laughter perhaps to torment him suzanne the titular character is a willowy blond who stairs vacuously into space and comforts the totally insane artist character the artist is going completely mad by the way either from his hamfisted overacting or the incredible awfulness of his paintings all of course terrible nudes of susanne there are some other characters that randomly show up a cigar chomping the man character who also is all hot for suzanne i guess he has a monologue i couldn t really ever figure out what he had to do with the story except everyone had to hate the man back then and you couldn t make a movie without one there is also a mute girl the mute girl pays off in the end trust me its incredibly stupid
this movie is one long chiche after another first of all though they did their share there is a unwarranted dope scene where john sniffs weed like an idiot the wigs and accents are terrible they sound worse then the old beatle cartoons john is the nasty envious closet homosexual slave to yoko he is portrayed as being in the discredited albert goldman book they even keep spouting song titles in regular conversation it was always just the two of us john would not have been mean to his fans like this either like his death showed us he was too nice if anything the one funny scene is where a dumb beatle fan only recognizes john and asks him to sing paul s yesterday an insulted john says something along the lines of sure and while i croon why don t you get down on your knees put on your wife s wig and lick my liggin that made me laugh for days really this movie is funny in how serious it tries to be while coming off ridiculous john and paul also did not sit pontificating all day they were funny light hearted guys who even during the beatles break up where far more personable then portrayed here forget it
good lord what were they thinking here is your spoiler warning even though i don t think it ll really matter you won t be seeing this piece of trash anyway a group of handpuppets go chasing after a group of really stupid people who go on a really stupid hunt for them to try and kill them and the puppets complicate things by letting them live out their really stupid fantasies in other words the whole thing is really stupid you know it has to be bad when even mike and the bots can t save something and they didn t i know some of their lines were funny like what to add to the sign hit and the hand comments but geez this was pretty dang sad all i can say is do not watch this piece o crud it is not worth your eyes
la chute de la maison usher or the fall of the house of usher as it s know amongst english audiences starts with allan charles lamy heading for the castle of his good friend sir roderick usher jean debucourt who sent him a letter saying that his wife madeleine is ill once there allan finds madeleine very sick her husband roderick determined almost obsessed to paint her portrait as roderick paints madeleine becomes weaker weaker almost as if the picture is draining the life out of her allan tries to help his friend but tragedy soon strikes this french production was co written produced directed by jean epstein was the second of two filmed the fall of the house of usher adaptations during honestly i don t know the original novel was published in i mean you wait years for a filmed adaptation two come along at the same time anyway i feel that i have a bit of a problem here as i have read plenty of positive comments about la chute de la maison usher maybe i m not the right sort of person to write a comment on it but i have to say that it simply didn t do anything for me i didn t like it obviously the first thing to say is that this is a silent film therefore it relies on imagery but even so i thought the story was weak i thought as a whole the film was boring dull even though it only lasts for about an hour it really didn t do anything for me at all la chute de la maison usher was made almost years ago that is literally a lifetime the world cinema tastes have moved on a lot since then i found no enjoyment in this film i feel this film has dated badly probably wasn t that good to start with anyway i never felt for any of the character s i never cared about anything that was happening i found it all rather tedious to sit through i m sorry if i ve offended any silent film fans out there but that s the way i felt director epstein does an ok job a lot of people ramble on about the imagery in la chute de la maison usher i will freely admit it definitely has it s moments but i thought they were few far between shots of people s mouths moving not actually hearing what they say just seemed weird to me i didn t like the music the version i saw kept the original french language insert cards which were narrated by guy with the most awful sounding thick french accent which was also off putting based on the story by edgar allen poe i doubt this has much resemblance to it apart from one or two basic elements stick with the fantastic roger corman house of usher starring vincent price technically the film was ok considering when it was made you simply cannot tell about the acting as no one ever speaks although the film is full of unnatural exaggerated movements to try suggest emotions or reflect what s happening which works to an extent but after a while just looks a bit daft la chute de la maison usher will appeal to those who crave a bygone era who live in caves or who are stuck in the past for me i like my films to have a story not to bore me to have sound i m sorry if that last statement makes me sound like an uneducated idiot but that s how i feel the world has moved on since for the better
i was at first disgusted with director sun woo jang because i had felt that he cheated me jang had the potential to create a strong deeply emotional film about sex and its effects on people but instead chose to focus his strength on the pornography element more than the actual human element i couldn t see the characters at first and his sloppy introduction which blended both realism and cinema together was amateurish at best yet this film remained in my mind for days after i viewed it what stayed with me wasn t the story it wasn t the characters nor was it the apparent pornographic nature of the film but the transition that jang demonstrated between y and j if you watch this film carefully you will see that both begin in an exploration phase of their relationship eager to jump into the unknown but not quite certain the next step as they continue to meet exploring new avenues of pleasure they continually jump between the aggressor and the aggressed jang initially explores the idea that j is the one that in control of the situation then hauntingly the reversal happens when j becomes obsessed with y it is a very small change and due to the graphic content of this film it can easily be missed but it is there it becomes apparently clear near the end when j cannot live with y as their meetings become less frequent and j attempts to become a part of normal society this was a huge and very exciting element to this film to see right before your eyes but alas it was the only element of this film worth viewing i will ignore those that speak of this film as nothing more than pornographic because there are human elements at the core of this film as underdeveloped as they are they are there it is a film about a facet of our lives that is very rarely explored in cinema or talked about in the papers what happens behind closed doors is never known or so we should believe while the act itself does becomes repetitive after a bit director jang tries to change it up a bit with some constantly changing scenery our characters are continually moving from hotel room to hotel room to best quench their thirst for each other s flesh this is fun at first but again jang s repetitive streak seems to make it feel boring than exciting this leads me to the biggest issue that i had with this film jang had a great story with gojitmal but where he failed outside of the obvious choice to focus directly on the pornographic side was that he took scenes repeated them time and again without changing in front of us to allow us to get to know the characters where was jang going with this movie did he want the sex to tell the stories or did he believe the characters would he failed in this sense because by the end of the film we know so little about y and j that we could care less how they resolve themselves the ending seems almost random at best as jang attempts to create a final resolution for our two absolute unknowns of this film i have to give jang some credit for trying but not much he attempted to create some sub stories that would create the personal element that we were lacking but they just couldn t congeal well together y s brother and j s wife were those plot points but again due to him focusing so strongly on the sexual element these stronger sub stories became un rememberable and down right dull maybe it was just how i viewed this film but outside of the sexual scenes nothing else worked together we knew nothing about j and y and that is why gojitmal failed finally i would like to say that this film could have benefited from having a strong score or a daftly remote music genre element to it to bring us the viewers closer to the emotions being felt by j and y from what i can remember and i am trying to push this film far from my mind i don t remember any musical undertones gojitmal may have been a stronger film if jang either stylized it with music or done something to allude towards our character s beings while i understand that he wanted the sex to speak for itself there was just a technical element missing from this film that may have quenched a stronger desire for more technically this was a poor film obviously an independent film in nature it felt more like director jang was trying to make symbolic references out of nothing instead of your typical independent of this nature i didn t see as much of a social message or human element like mentioned above i just felt like he threw this film together over the course of two weeks and understood that the sex would sell it enough this was no larry clark production this was sub par and definitely needed some further technical clicks to develop it stronger than the final release overall i think i could have liked this film and there were smaller elements that i did enjoy but i felt this film was rushed repetitive and played too much towards the taboos instead of breaking them the obvious pitfalls of this film can be seen by the last scene of this film when we are privy to how the title of this film was conceived our characters were uneventful our story was underdeveloped and we could have used something memorable to make what was happening between y and j into something more symbolic than sex to me jang was trying too much to capture art house meets pornographic and it failed miserably this was not a film worth the time and effort that it took to make grade out of
years ago i saw the godfather and it made a lasting impression on me the atmosphere of the movie was first class the acting memorable and the storyline a classic recently i bought the trilogy and after watching part again i looked eagerly to viewing part i was so pleased to realize early on into part that here was a fitting follow on to the great godfather movie again everything was just about perfect and i could not wait to see godfather iii wrong i wish i d stopped at ii the storyline was not good it seemed to me like a story made up just to have a story the characters were weak especially the daughter pacino s protege was a weak character that would have been eaten alive in godfather or then scenes such as corleone being invested with all the trappings of the catholic church with full choir the assassin on horseback riding away into the sunset the unseen helicopter machine gunning of the meeting where the goodies get away and everyone else is shot daughter and st cousin rolling bits of pasta across a board the pathetic shooting on the steps corleone stuffing sweets down him with orange juice for diabetes a man of his intelligence and guile isn t ready for an emergency no it was not good and with the best will in the world i wont be able to watch it again but i ll watch many times down the years
the last reviewer was very generous i quiet like the first movie but can t say i enjoy this one very much the beginning is bearable but it goes downhill pretty quickly i just don t see jon bon jovi as a bad ass vampire hunter and the vampire princess is neither sexy nor scary a lot of the scenes just do not make sense i mean any normal person would suspect something is up when a strange woman suddenly appearing out of nowhere to seduce you let alone an experienced hunter why una is able to communicate with jovi nothing was ever explain in this movie you wouldn t mind if it was entertaining but that was too much to ask this has to be one of worst vampire movie i have seen
despite the gravity of the subject and probably the good intentions of the filmmakers to make a film addressing white supremacy the inconsistencies of its main character bronson green aspiring new york actor easily turned l a phony makes it hard to take the story seriously green who is constantly rejected by los angeles casting agents for being obsolete i e too new york when the s is looking for big blonde and dumb he finds success comes easily when he s willing to succumb to falsifying his image unfortunately the new hair dye and pacified surfer attitude lands him an acting opportunity with the jericho church which subscribes white supremacist teaching of the aryan nation green is willing to easily forget his past and particularly turning his back on his young black friend of ten years in order to be the church s new spokesman this makes no sense seeing as how principled our character initially is it is this sudden and loose change in character coupled with an abrupt reversion back to the hardened deniro obsessed as his taxi driver character form who is able to battle the villains a noble attempt on the filmmakers but one that ultimately reveals itself as anything but serious the other characters too are quite annoying and what we are forced to recognize in them comes too easily the psychotic paranoia of the church leader the self interested actress girlfriend the first girlfriend bronson has when he s in l a and the new blonde girlfriend who s character lacks so much development she is for the most part just a walking talking void we are just supposed to see them in fleeting moments in which something random forces us to draw assumptions about the characters but there is really little development of any of them the other problem with this film is the ungodly amount of time the characters are involved in very little important action much of the beginning concerns introducing the characters obviously and later we see bronson s difficulties with breaking into the l a acting scene and the frustrations which stem from constant rejection but after he does willingly change his looks and personality in order to become accepted there is at least a good twenty minutes to thirty minutes of wasted film in which very little of anything happens for films that seek to draw attention to the irrational fears behind racism this was not one done with enough credibility
this little show is obviously some stupid little prequel spin off of the original series compared to the live action series this show is utter crap the live action show had intelligent jokes and story lines while the animated series is basically a toned down bittersweet version for younger viewers to digest but i think maybe kids deteste this crap the storyline in every episode is basically just sabrina has some stupid and pointless dillemma and she uses magic to fix it thats basiclly the idea every episode the most bizarre episode was when sabrina uses magic to become gem and gem to become sabrina so then gem becomes a witch and hypnotizes harvery to become her slave this then leads to a bizarre yet rather interesting scene were gem says just adore me for now and harvey get down on his hands and knees and starts kissing her feet like shes a god which is quite right since he s her mind control slave but this stupid spin off is not worth the time or the effort
i m a christian who generally believes in the theology taught in left behind that being said i think left behind is one of the worst films i ve seen in some time to have a good movie you need to have a well written screenplay left behind fell woefully short on this for one thing it radically deviates from the book sometimes this is done to condense a page novel down to a two hour film but in this film i saw changes that made no sense whatsoever another thing there is zero character development when characters in the story get saved i won t say who the book makes it clear that it s a long soul searching process in the film it s quick and artificial the book is written decently enough where people like rayford steele buck williams and hattie durham seem real but in the movie scenarios are consistently given the quick treatment without anything substantial in another scene where one character gets angry about being left behind again i won t say who it seems artificial i realize as a christian it s unedifying for me to say i disliked this film but i can t in a good conscience recommend a film that i feel was horribly done perhaps it would ve been better to make the first book into films either way christians need to realize that to be taken seriously as filmmakers we need to start by putting together a film in a quality way i realize a lot of effort probably went into left behind but that s the way i see it
i ll keep this fast and sweet five girls on their way home from a football game decide to take a short cut that leads them down a deserted forest ridden road of course nothing but good things happen to them and they safely arrive at their destination alright they don t soon they re hunted down by a deranged chick who has some severe mental issues and what ensues is minutes of sheer boredom i hope to never see any of these actors in any movie ever again their screaming screeching voices gave me a headache and the script was so poorly written that it included a lot of repeat phrases and nonsensical hysterical screaming all in all one of the worst cheap horror flicks i ve ever seen and i ve seen a lot
it would help to know why it took so long for a book as movie ready as the house next door to be adapted for film or television the book was copyrighted in one reason could be problems designing the house the house in this lifetime film is really so ugly that i can t imagine anyone buying it in fact it s so ugly that someone would probably have come and destroyed it as soon as it was built i m not crazy about horror genre books but this one was hard to put down when i came across it around ten years ago the main characters are not the kind of people to look for anything occult in life and this is one of the book s strengths they are not people who would conclude that the architect was some type of demon or the devil personified without witnessing and analyzing the events described so well in the book however it is a downbeat book for the most part and i don t think that appeals to the people who run lifetime maybe someone will come up with another version of the book in years to come a better house better music a better screenplay and darker lighting would certainly help
winter kills is a terrible incoherent and very disappointing conspiracy comedy thriller from little known director william richert while watching the film i honestly felt as if i was the emperor in the classic fable the emperor s new clothes the film made me feel like a fool because i couldn t make head nor tail of the serpentine plot and the nonsensical characters but i felt kind of embarrassed to admit to myself that the film was tying my brain up in knots so i stuck with it to the end hoping that the whole tangled mess would untangle itself then i realised the film is supposed to be serpentine nonsensical and illogical because that s the whole point this is a satirical look at conspiracy theories and theorists with the knotting up of the plot used as a metaphor for the knotting up of truths half truths and lies that define any conspiracy even when i got that the joke was on me i still felt winter kills to be a pretty awful movie young nick kegan jeff bridges is the younger brother of a former united states president who was assassinated in philadelphia nick is present when a dying man claims that he shot the president and gives detailed information about where he hid the gun nick follows the clues but every step of the way the people helping him seem to die in mysterious circumstances also his father pa kegan john huston a vulgar and disgustingly wealthy businessman keeps interfering with nick s investigation the deeper he delves into the assassination the more nick realises that he is descending into a web of complex lies and red herrings where nothing is as it seems and no one can be trusted the film is an utter nightmare to follow and in many ways is not worth trying to follow for the afore mentioned reason that it deliberately tangles itself up the cast is packed with extraordinary talent but most of them are wasted toshiro mifune has one of the briefest and most pointless cameo roles in cinematic history elizabeth taylor appears uncredited and has not a single line of dialogue richard boone is given what seems to be an interesting role but his character goes nowhere john huston has the best role as the powerful patriarch and provides us with the film s few enjoyable moments with his acerbic delivery anthony perkins also gets a creepy role and handles it well though his screen time is far too short to do complete justice to the character some nudity and sex scenes are tossed in for no real reason and while they re quite graphic and might appeal to voyeurs they really belong in another film the film s semi comic climax is farcical and disappointing yet paradoxically memorable in its weird little way there s obviously a cult audience out there somewhere for winter kills but i won t be counting myself among its number
amy heckerling s second film johnny dangerously is a parody of s gangster films made in the warner brothers tradition michael keaton stars as a middle aged gangster looking back at his life of hard knocks when he catches a kid trying to steal something from his pet store in keaton s mother maureen stapleton has continuing health problems so keaton falls into crime at an early age via peter boyle meanwhile the fargan richard dimitri plays a rival crime lord to boyle and keaton eventually rises through the ranks joe piscopo has a hilarious turn as danny vermin yeah that s right vermin griffin dunne is keaton s younger brother turned district attorney glynnis o connor his wife and marilu henner plays keaton s moll the film looks notoriously cheap making it seem like a television show instead of a theatrical film the film starts out great and then slows down as expected after the first half hour due to the combination of dialog and gags the film holds its own for the first half but then it rapidly loses steam and descends into mediocrity and vulgarity in the second half keaton chews the scenery doing his best james cagney impression stapleton has several vulgar lines that are only obnoxious not funny piscopo does the once bit one time too many several supporting actors try to hold up the fort like danny devito dom deluise ray walston as a street vendor alan hale jr as a desk sergeant and sudie bond as an unscrupulous cleaning lady the second half evolves into a hit or miss television show type tone and never recovers the closing scene utilizing the roaring twenties is an anachronism as is the call of the wild clark gable film seen on a marquee earlier in the film i think heckerling should have known better since the targeted audience would certainly be aware of the roaring twenties actual release date of stars
the plot sounded like it had promise to be honest i did not watch the entire movie after about an hour into the movie i had to make a decision is this movie worth watching until it conclusion the answer was clearly no it was not the fact that the human body could not receive a transplant from a different species without rejecting it nor the premise that he was being chased by secret government authorities for an human wolf transplant it was because the movie was badly written acting lacked emotion and i did not understand the several dream sequences with the wolves and buffaloes when he was running to the zoo with a dog pack and leaving them at the front of the zoo gate the saying if you can t run with the big dogs don t leave the porch kept running through my bored mind save yourself the time and skip this movie i can guarantee if you do dare to watch it you will sit there slack jawed as i did wondering why anyone waste money time energy and effort to make this insulting outrage to american cinema
i was excited to hear that cesar montano had decided to make a movie in the cebuano language not dialect as most filipinos will incorrectly refer to it as as cebuano and tagalog are as mutually unintelligible as french and spanish are to each other but i was greatly disappointed when i saw this movie being a canadian of cebuano parents i was optimistic about the revival of the visayan film industry when i heard about this film i was further excited to hear that it wasn t another stupid action movie or melodrama as filipinos love these types of movies but alas i was short changed panaghoy serves as an ego trip for cesar montano montano of course plays the hero of the movie and when i say hero i mean in the most stereotypical of manners his function is to win the heart of a girl and lead the bol anons to victory against the japanese his character has no depth or complexity he just fits the hero mold the rest of the characters are one dimensional they all fit their cookie cutter roles i m all for slow moving meditative movies but this movie was just slow moving it didn t really meditate on anything just because a movie is historically themed a drama and slow moving doesn t make it a well made film particularly annoying is the american actor philip anthony his performance was embarrassing if montano wanted to revive the visayan film industry he should have really thought this through he said he wanted to make visayan movies that could compete at cannes and toronto etc but really this movie would have been booed and hissed at at such festivals to get visayan films into the mainstream consciousness he should have at least made a movie that would have attracted audiences even if it meant sacrificing quality obviously he didn t think about or get information on what kind of movies garner awards at cannes so an audience attracting movie would have been at least a foot in the door i m afraid now that visayan movies will not be made for a long time again because of this movie if ever i said to a filipino that i want to see more visayan movies of course i d get an answer like visayans don t make good movies didn t you see panaghoy sa suba of course this is ludicrous as it is one example of a visayan movie and probably the only example that anyone nowadays would be likely to see an example of movies that are meditative not just slow moving are the tagalog film blackout or david lynch s the straight story i hate to promote the tagalog language as it is endlessly and unfairly promoted and shoved down the throats of non tagalog filipinos but for the sake of calling a spade a spade i say that blackout is a very good movie these movies rely heavily on what hitchcock called pure cinema images without words are used to convey the story but i bend the definition a bit for the sake of these two movies in that these movies use images without words to convey the mood of the movie and they do it very well panaghoy thinks that if they simply take sweeping shots of the landscape then they have established the mood and what s with so many filipino movies featuring a dying mother or grandmother
as a history nut who is particularly interested in this particular historical event i was very disappointed with the movie granted the costumes and staging was quite authentic but the hollywood portrayal of this british little big horn was truly boring the amount of film footage dedicated to marching or parading troops has to have been unprecedented in film history eveytime i heard triumphant background music begin i knew i had to prepare myself for another laborious scene of meaningless filler obviously the producers had invested heavily into staging and were determined to get their money s worth despite the outstanding cast their dialogue was again boring and their characters were never developed whenever peter o toole or burt lancaster finished a scene i would cringe with disappointment their given lines were so weak and meaningless that i could hardly believe these were the same two great actors who portrayed lawrence of arabia and the bird man of alcatraz respectively there are worse epics but this one is not much better
i don t normally feel much of an incentive to comment on films i don t like but in a case like this one i just have to say something this movie is terrible illogical and stupid there are so many flaws in the storytelling that i don t even feel obliged to elaborate on because it s time for me to move on from this experience the most annoying point is however that at no point in the film does anyone explain whether the motivations for bacon s character s madness are due to a power trip or a physiological reaction to his condition granted the special effects are impressive and in the past paul verhoeven has done some good stuff the director s cut of robocop on dvd is great however this movie is stupid and generally doesn t come near to explaining the point or technical aspect of the subject matter and instead settles for predictable action without any enjoyment in short as many other reviews here say wish i had read them before stay away from this film
this is one of the most putrid movies of the s i would not recommend it if you have something better to do this picture presents african americans as savage uncultured violent inarticulate reefer smoking sociopaths fudge ice cube and his posse of homies are continuously disrespectful toward others in the dorm not just the white people but asians too and are never disciplined for their actions despite all that tolerance they keep on whining and crying about the evil white oppressors who run their lives and stand in their way in fact it is fudge s influence that causes remmy to bond with the skin heads to drop out of college and eventually to kill malik s girlfriend the skinheads are presented as a covert group of underachievers who share a pad off campus and generally stay away from everyone else they never blast their music to annoy people nor do they taunt the police they do commit serious crime such as battery and rape yet they re not as repulsive nor as threatening as fudge and dreads busta rhymes are there s a lot of material in this film which almost offended me or made me giggle some of it is as follows below fudge and dreads are stated as students at the columbus university yet we never see them in class and it is completely unclear how they pay their tuition one is only left to speculate that the weed they smoke has something to do with their finances though they are students at what looks like a private university they cannot utter a single line of proper english their characters are developed only through their compulsive whining and xenophobia it appears that drunken kristen kristy swanson knew exactly why drunken billy was taking her to his house she even asked him to get a rubber so that they could begin the fact that he penetrated her without a condom became a rape whilst it would be great sex only if he had one handy later kristen was assured by taryn jennifer connely that she holds no accountability in that matter and despite willfully jumping into a guy s bed she wasn t ready for sexual intercourse and was viciously taken advantage of by a sexual predator then a week or so later she met and slept with an ultra sensitive do gooder who knew how to avoid raping and brought a condom the director stressed contraception thoroughly this movie is complete and utter garbage that makes black people look like pricks and women look stupid and frail cole hauser s acting and laurence fishburne s accent are the only reasons i can think of to watch it the writer director is obviously a man of limited intelligence go ahead and limit your own by watching this crap if you want but keep in mind that neurons don t grow back just follow the advice at the end and unlearn
saturday night live national lampoon and sctv alumnus are all together in a sometimes funny sketch film however it is very interesting to watch now at the start of twenty years after this movie is supposed to take place look at how many of their gags have become absolutely true there is a mock movie trailer that probably wasn t even clever at the time for something called the pregnant man which came true with arnold schwarzenegger s dumb movie junior there is a commercial spoof that probably wasn t even clever at the time for something featuring sammy davis jr and jackie onasis called celebrity wrestling which has now come true with a popular show called celebrity boxing there is a mock movie trailer that probably wasn t even clever at the time that features john candy in a movie about a severed head watch this trailer and look how similar it s shots and plot are to frank hellenlotter s basket case and finally there is an ad for a late late show documentary about a dead dream the only two left the name of the documentary is the last hippies lol four prophecies come true
imagine the worst a team episode add even more bad taste remove humor and you might get an idea of how despicable this movie is looks like a teenager stole daddy s camcorder and filmed the explosion of his little sister barbie model house pathetic
this movie should not be viewed unless you are trying to kill yourself i think this movie could actually cause severe brain damage the main characters are the whiny non hero kevin amy his bratty ungodly conservative girlfriend kyle a dork in red shorts who enjoys phone sex daphne a scrawny horny girl who is supposed to be cool and has no sense of how to dress and her oversexed boyfriend nick an army recruit who can make an innuendo out of anything no i m not a pervert that s really how the movie goes the movie itself is an over sexed rip off of s gremlins only you ll never find a trace of gizmo anywhere no these hobgoblins unleashed by wimpy man i m sorry kevin make someone s wildest dreams come true and then kill the victims yes you guessed it eventually they wind up in a strip club where the nerdy amy s greatest dream is revealed she wants to be a stripper look i watched this flick via mst k and even with mike nelson tom servo and crow t robot making a laughing stock out of this cinematic trainwreck and it still made me bleed from both eyes not really but i wish i had i m not giving you anymore plot because reliving it gives me this great urge to drive a pitchfork through my brain besides it s not like there s a plot worth mentioning they should put a surgeon s general warning on this film
i agree with the previous comment the beginning of the movie is quite good and get s you wandering about what is to come which is nothing all open story lines remain open two characters who at first seemed like they might be of some importance are completely left out of the picture save for or very short scenes i wander if ilya wouldn t have done better to just completely leave them out as for the one remaining character nothing is done with her either she just visits some god awful place and suddenly the movie isn t about her anymore but about some geriatric witches who spend their days making dolls out of bread drinking homemade vodka and apparently flashing each other some may say the movie does well in showing a society crumbling like the judges of the iffr but for me it is just bad taste bad camera work a lousy script and frightfully bad direction therefor i can not be as generous as my predecessor when it comes to grading
recap according to legend the valkyrie brunhilda defied odin and was chained to a rock surrounded by an eternal fire only a warrior pure in heart can pass through the flames free brunhilda and release her from odin s claim and have her for himself now war is brewing in the norse lands and the king needs an alliance with the berserkers the berserkers are warriors claimed by odin s valkyries lusting for war blood and flesh and therefore outcasts but superior in battle the leader of the berserkers is a scorned son of the king boar and his price for the alliance is his brother the future king barek but after the king is victorious in battle he refuses to give up his only remaining son breaking his oath to boar and betray him and kill him boar is saved only by barek s call upon odin but this is only the start of the battle between the brothers and their final battle is about to start now a millennia later comments i had hopes that this would be a movie based upon some viking ground far too little quality movie about viking has been done it started out very good too with detailed longships and armors nice and fitting sceneries and an ok battle the foundation in the aesir myths is thin and seems very corrupted to me odin is much more vengeful spiteful and absent than i remind him from school and the valkyries has been turned into some vampire demons i m no expert but that seems outright wrong but the fatal mistake made by this movie is to move the time setting from the original time period to today if the two brothers had fought it out in the correct time with some decent battles this movie would have been much better now the setting suddenly is changed to present day stockholm still odin is present and is sending boar and his berserkers for brunhilda and barek which gives silly scenes when armor clad and painted berserkers swordfights with barek among the industries beautiful mountains and woods have been exchanged for cement and when allowed to focus upon single fights instead of massive battles as in the beginning i quickly saw that the fights and skills of the actors are slow and clumsy the end result is thin story sometimes hard to follow and other times just silly and the only that could save it the action is drawn from slow dull and clumsy swordfights it draws very little from aesir myth or viking tradition thus both story and action fails and the movie is just plain bad finally as a swede this movie is a little confusing supposedly filmed entirely in south africa it still contains some familiar swedish signs plates and what seems to be an authentic police car however the effort is poor and only goes so far as to really set it in sweden no names are swedish perhaps with anya as the exception no familiar sceneries are swedish they supposedly speak a little ancient norwegian not swedish and uniforms both police and medical are clearly not swedish if they were not going to even try to do it correctly and really give the illusion that it is set in sweden why bother at all
i watched envy two nights ago on dvd at a friends house the premise of this film is quite promising jack black and ben stiller in a comedy with a lot of potential but it completely fails to deliver i watched it with about five friends and no one laughed for the entire film the jokes which are few and far between are not funny in any way the story line is crap and they never answer the question where does the sh t go of course the answer to that is no one cares this film lacks any sort of comedy value and as a few other users have said the only thing that makes it even almost worth watching is christopher walken as the j man none of the characters are developed the plots so thin it s nearly transparent and is that song throughout the film supposed to be funny
i tend to love everything the great late paul naschy r i p ever was in while not all films starring naschy are great they all have a specific charm that can be found nowhere but in naschy flicks and they are always entertaining there is no rule without exception however as el mariscal del infierno aka the devil s possessed proves while the film does have the specific naschy flick charm it sadly drags far too much and gets really really dull in between naschy stars as the evil baron gilles de lancr who oppresses the people and uses black magic and bloody rituals to stay in power when gaston de malebranche guillermo bredeston who fought side by side with gilles de lancr against the british learns about the baron s evil behavior he decides to turn against his former comrade in arms and help the people free themselves from the satanic baron s tyranny directed by le n klimovsky who is best known for directing naschy in la noche de walpurgis the werewolf vs the vampire woman the film was scripted by naschy himself naschy often scripted his own films and one must say that he mostly did a better more original job than it is the case here el mariscal del infierno is mostly built up as a historical adventure rather than a horror film and it gets quite boring throughout the middle it often resembles the sword and sandal films from the s only that this film is set in medieval times the satanic part was probably only added because the great paul naschy s name is linked to the horror genre the film has its good parts paul naschy giving weird speeches paul naschy looking weird paul naschy doing satanic stuff paul naschy torturing innocent victims etc but sadly most of the film concentrates on the boring hero and the good guys and these moments are boring the female cast members are nice to look at but unlike most naschy films this one features no nudity and sleaze there is some gore but it mostly looks clumsy and isn t as fun too look at as it is the case with most other naschy films overall el mariscal del infierno is only worth a look for my fellow naschy enthusiasts there are dozens of films starring the spanish horror deity which should be seen before this one such as el jorobado de la morgue the hunchback of the morgue la orgia de los muertos the hanging woman el espanto surge de la tumba horror rises from the tomb latidos de panico panic beats rojo sangre or any of the waldemar daninsky werewolf films r i p paul naschy legends never die
i love special effects and witnessing new technologies that make science fiction seem real the special effects of this movie are very good i have seen most of this movie since it s been airing on hbo for the past couple of months i must admit i may have missed a few scenes but i m usually drawn into movies and have seen some scenes more than once but every time i see some of hollow man i feel depressed almost like a film noir i m not sure why perhaps it s that i don t want kevin bacon to be evil and there s disappointment in that but i think it s witnessing just how relentlessly evil he becomes regardless i can recommend this movie for excitement although some parts move slowly but i do not recommend for youngsters under the age of perhaps if they are mature
the film is about a young man michael who cares for the elderly one day he decides to kill some of the relatives of his clients around the same time he decides to model his killing after the zodiac killer of the s he gets in touch with the author of a book about the zodiac killer and they form a friendship michael has a gun aparently the only gun as it seems to be in the hands of some of the other actors only not portrayed as the same gun and he goes out a killin original this is a great film if you like b movies i thought the idea of the movie was good but the editing and the acting really drowned the plot i thought the blood was just too fake the lighting was horrible in some places and the dialog was just too standard the movie was shot on video which is okay but the editing of the film just made for some weird plan scenes not a bad movie for fans of the b movie genre but if you want something with a bit more polish move on to something else
this movie is not for the faint or weak of heart it couldn t decide if it was going to be porn or legit it was neither one it was just bad there was nothing in this movie to make me want to see anything else made by these people again
when i decided to watch the barbarians starring those twin bodybuilders peter and david paul i thought it couldn t be that bad because the film was directed by ruggero deodato who has a reputation for creating sleazy movies but well made sleazy movies well the barbarians is remarkably trashy action adventure movie that wants to be another conan the barbarian and fails at every level the look of the film is all wrong some scenes were well shot but the tone and the schintzy tacky disco look of the clothes and hair people are adorned with just doesn t make any sense whatsoever even for a low budget flick like this one richard lynch looks like an old woman with that ridiculous hairdo and costume he s supposed to be menacing but he comes across as a buffoon and it s funny to see eva larue callahan one of the stars of all my children appear in her first movie walking around in skimpy fur bikini i m sure she wants this dreck to disappear from the face of the earth the so called barbarian twins are okay as the muscle bound heroes but it s almost impossible to construct a proper critique of their acting because their roles are like everything else in this mess really ill conceived the only way the film tries to differentiate one twin from the other is by having one twin wear a loincloth that covers his ass while the other twin s loincloth barely covers his muscular butt i m not kidding don t ask me who s who though deodato must have been really desperate to agree to make this film and his desperation is reflected perfectly in this trashy flick it s just bad
the word st in the title has more ominous meaning for the viewers of this film than for its crime victims at least they don t have to stick around and watch this interminable film reach its own demise st should refer to st draft of a script st takes used in each performance in the final film st edit in post production etcetera etcetera the movie is not cast too badly it s just that everything about the film come off as worse than third rate from the goofy script to the wooden performances and while suffering through this cobbled together film by the hour mark you want to be put out of your misery at minutes long it is readily apparent that it should have been edited to under hours going into details concerning the lame script and acting serves little purposes even in the equally awful lake placid at least the performances bill pullman and bridget fonda constructed out of an extremely weak script were nuanced enough to make you laugh at the movie in st to die one ends up grieving only for the time lost in waiting to see what happens after the opening scene of the preparation of the female lead s suicide the editing is so bad one is never introduced to one of the main characters who i think were never quite told is a d a she just appears in one scene in the middle of a conversation obviously the scene where she is introduced to the viewer was dropped on the editor s floor and no one realized that a character appearing out of nowhere was an unusual film ploy in a word don t waste your time with this one my wife and i wish we didn t but at least we created our own diversions by commenting in various places in the film like it was mystery science theater meanwhile in cleveland
i watch bad movies this movie is not good enough to be a bad movie not an ounce of humor not an ounce of talent throughout i am lazy usually i see a bad movie and curse this was so bad i actually made a review to try and save others from the completely boring mess i fell victim to i am smashing my copy of this movie it s too lame even to use clear a room so boring watch bloodsucking freaks or shock shock shock for absolute crap that has some merit as entertainment this sludge looks awful is awful and whoever made it should feel awful
so this was an hbo made for tv movie eh is that an excuse for such a pathetic plot and terrible acting such a shame to see jim belushi reduced to a role so repetitive shot at survived lies beaten up survives shot at lies and so ad infinitum call that a script as for the brits embarrassing to see timothy dalton s pathetic or was he just taking the p depends how much he was paid i guess attempt at a southern sheriff as for that other brit the bleached blond one what a w er there is a trend towards glorifying these english speaking sic super violent thugs lately perhaps thanks to mr madonna s two movies succeed in entertaining and justify the violence by skillful use of irony and humour like pulp fiction does however this movie discredits and devalues the genre definately one to miss
the screaming skull outta stars this movie boasts some pretty cool opening credits an offscreen narrator warning that movie patrons will be offered a free burial if they die of fright watching this movie a scary shot of a skull emerging from a placid pool and the ubiquitous scary music but sadly the movie is all downhill from there a widowed man takes his new bride to his secluded mansion admonishing his servants and friends that the new mrs has a very fragile disposition due to a tragedy in her past well in no time at all she begins to see and hear mysterious things that no one else can her husband assures her that it s all merely in her mind and well you can probably see where this all is going you will have figured out what s going on long before our hapless heroine because you have probably seen the exact same plot in hundreds of other movies and tv shows and done better too to add to the movie s myriad transgressions most cuts of this movie on numerous cheap dvd compilations seem to be missing a few key scenes you see the heroine slowly walking towards the window she goes to open it you know she is going to see something scary and then suddenly the scene cuts to her sobbing in her husband s arms so what did she see i guess we ll never know
nut case is murdering college students can new teacher stop the madness believe me you won t care with a title like splatter university one would immediately gather that this movie just isn t high art but worse than that splatter university doesn t even qualify for amusing garbage splatter u is so poorly made the story is mindless the characters are throw aways and the whole movie lacks any essence of imagination needless to say there is no suspense or atmosphere or scares this drivel isn t even brave enough to throw in any nudity for the cheapest thrill of all so all around this endlessly flawed slasher offers nothing in the way of entertainment not even cheap laughs and just becomes a complete bore bottom of the barrel folks even die hard slasher fans will want to think twice before viewing let alone paying money for this flick bomb out of
i was expecting a documentary that focused on the tobacco industry in north carolina instead i watched a man who rues the fact that his great grandfather lost his tobacco empire to the duke family and this went on and on if mr mcelwee s family had prevailed over the dukes i doubt that mr mcelwee would have any problems with the death toll caused by tobacco related diseases i grew up near the area where mr mcelwee s family began it tobacco business i expected more than mcewee s continual focus on his family i learned very little about the history of tobacco in the nc economy and the ramifications to the state s economy by tighter regulation of tobacco the countless references to the movie bright leaves are out of place so what if gary cooper played mr mcelwee s great grandfather does the viewer gain any understanding of the role of tobacco in the north carolina economy by the showing of old film clips of a fictionalized film i didn t
i do not even want to call this thing a film it is a movie that should not have won any awards the acting was horrible as were the silly scenarios this is exactly the sort of film that so many folks think caters to an nri audience but is in fact loathed abroad for its awkwardness and the overwhelming sense of trying throughout the movie i find it strange that so many actors conversant with the english language have such a hard time doing so convincingly in front of the camera i m sure many readers know what i am talking about all those token english phrases thrown into a movie in hindi and in regional cinema for cool points there are few indian movies in which the english seems completely genuine being cyrus was a recent one although not a great film it was a good film and the language did not seem put on i feel ashamed that p was awarded the nfa in the only semi enjoyable parts of this rubbish were konkana and a somewhat catchy background score other than that do not even waste your time with this film
caught part of george on tv recently but couldn t get myself to watch it through to the end just awful i can t even remember the plot all i know is that george and ursula were not the george and ursula of the first movie which was bad enough there s a lot of scrambling around but the direction and editing were so shoddy and choppy it was like watching outtakes or deleted scenes having the original voice of ape the ape back was not nearly enough to make me warm up to this george is probably the single worst sequel i have ever seen and that is saying something jeez because of imdb s lines rule i have to keep typing when i have nothing more to say about this crapulastic made for tv sequel disney hang your head in shame
the legend of bloody jack is set in the alaskan wilderness starts as a relative of some murderous deceased occultist lumberjack reads incantations the evil dead style from an ancient spell book in an attempt to resurrect him he succeeds not being a big believer in family unity the lumberjack dude kills his relative two days later ray travis quentin young along with his sister dawn erica hoag her boyfriend nick craig bonacorsi four of their friends pull up outside a cosy log cabin the evil dead style with a view to a relaxing weekend in the wilderness unfortuntaely the killer lumberjack dude show s up with his axe starts to slaughter the friends one by one edited written executive produced directed by todd portugal this is a pretty rotten modern slasher flick the likes of which are killing the horror genre for me i m just not a big fan of ultra low budget horror films with the production values of a holiday video the script is absolutely terrible in every way for minutes it has every bad slasher clich the character s are awful the dialogue is terrible it s hard to care about anyone or anything in this pretty worthless excuse for a teen slasher film the teens are even more annoying stupid than usual the script is more moronic predictable flawed than usual the killer lumberjack dude is just lame then there s the final minutes or so which if you make it that far believe it s tough going produces one of the worst twist ending in slasher film history which as far as i m concerned pokes fun at us the paying audience who has just had to sit through minutes worth of crap i will now spoil the ending so anyone who doesn t want to know it stop reading now basically just before the end of the film it cuts back to ray telling a story it turns out he was telling the story of what we had just seen nick dawn everyone else berates him for telling such a bad story i felt their pain then proceed to pick holes in it laugh at it from saying why did they stand around argue why didn t they pick the axe up such things i felt like this was poking fun at the audience as those were the sorts of things i was asking myself while watching this crap to have it shoved down my throat made perfectly clear that the makers knew the script was crap could see all the holes in it went for a twist ending which unashamedly rubbishes the preceding minutes which we have just had to sit through remember is just a little grating then to add insult to injury the lumberjack dude turns up kills everyone within two minutes why didn t he do that to start with it would have saved everyone a lot of time director portugal turns in a real mess this has the worst continuity between night day in a film i have ever seen the whole film is meant to set at night i suspect the makers tried to use the day for night process but it didn t work most of it looks like it is set during the day for example look at when lisa is trapped in the bathroom she climbs out of the window it is clearly pitch black outside when we are looking out from inside the bathroom but when she falls to the ground the films cuts to an exterior shot it s bright daylight then there s the fact ranger vince says we can t get a search party out here until the morning indicating it was supposed to be night then several minutes later when he walks outside it looks like it s the middle of the day he is actually carrying around a torch which is clearly on he is clearly pointing it in the directions where he is looking like it s night anytime there is a scene set in the cabin look at the windows it s pitch black outside when the ranger walks in through the door to start with is also another clear example the continuity in this film is simply the worst i have ever seen there isn t much gore there are a few scenes of an axe going into people bodies but nothing memorable it s not scary there s no tension or atmosphere the appalling day night continuity is just so distracting because it s so obvious technically the film is rock bottom again the continuity between night day has to been seen to be believed how bad it is the special effects are poor they couldn t even afford to show a car blowing up even though it s pretty vital to the plot this has amateur hour written all over it from start to finish the acting is absolutely brilliant everyone involved should get an oscar nah only joking not really they were utterly awful even the girls who got their breasts out weren t very good looking the legend of bloody jack is just an awful teen slasher flick it looks like it was shot on a camcorder without the use of a tripod or steadycam it has awful effects is boring has a twist ending which is either the most insulting in horror film history or i ve got it totally wrong it s the most clever not recommended watch a decent slasher from the s or s to remind you how they should be done
so altogether i found this documentary to be strange and really pointless i know it got awards and things but i personally did not enjoy it too much there was no humor or drama in it to keep you interested just a bunch of wierdos and their jobs some of the people in are rather different which isn t a bad thing it just didn t leave a good impression on me i was thoroughly bored by this movie no offense to my creative writing teacher the circus theme throughout the whole movie was kinda cool but i didn t get it and robotics and lion taming is definitely not my thing the green animals thing was neat i really liked the garden lots of colorful flowers but how did these four jobs connect it just didn t make much sense to me why someone would make a movie about that but if you are into stuff like this you might enjoy it who am i to stand in your way i am just forewarning you about possible suffering
the end of violence and certainly the million dollar hotel hinted at the idea the wenders has lost his vision his ability to tell compelling stories through a map of the moving picture the land of plenty seals the coffin i m afraid by being a vastly unimaginative obviously sentimental and clich d film the characters are entirely flat and stereotyped the writing plot and direction are amateurish at best for the first time in quite a while i was impatient for the film to end so i could get on with my life the war torn delirium of the uncle the patriotic abstract gazing at the sky at the conclusion it all just struck me as being so simple and pathetic hardly the work of a filmmaker who once made some compelling magic on screen what happened the days of experimentation perceptive writing and interesting filming possibilities are long behind him i m afraid let s hope he finds his inspiration again at the toronto film festival which is where i saw the film wenders was there to introduce it completely lacking in humility he offered us the following i hope no wait i know you re going to enjoy the next two hours i m afraid he couldn t be more wrong
i am a youth pastor s wife and we took some youth to see this film we then spent an hour trying to explain it to them they didn t get it and i didn t enjoy it it is based on a concept that has run through all three of the major religions of the world the bible code the torah code and the code in the koran and is so questionable as to be laughable this is not a step forward for christians in the arts it is a step forward for those who believe we check our brains at the door
this movie is the worst ive seen nicole kidman really dissapointed me this movie has nothing i would not watch it again even if it were the last movie on earth great actors but bad script
an innocent man steve guttenberg has a one night stand with his boss s wife isabelle huppert she spots a woman elizabeth mcgovern being attacked outside but she can t call the cops because it would blow her marriage to gutenberg s boss paul shenar so guttenberg honest citizen that he is when he discovers that another woman was attacked and killed nearby only half an hour later comes forward and claims to have witnessed the first attack merely intending to pass on the information given to him by huppert well never bear false witness against thy neighbor as they say this simple attempt to help the police nab a murderer turns rapidly twisted when he meets the first near victim mcgovern she immediately twigs to what happened but agrees to keep quiet for the moment but then guttenberg finds himself in court supposed to identify the heavy greenquist and we discover through cross examination that he is near sighted and can t identify objects at a distance let alone faces not that it matters because after all he never saw the creep in the first place the plot gets practically labyrinthine guttenberg winds up the chief suspect when huppert is murdered too he barely escapes arrest and holes up with the now sympathetic mcgovern guttenberg and mcgovern hatch a plan to trap the murderer she will serve as bait they ll follow the flagitious creep into one of his seedy haunt and mcgovern will act like the doxy that the murderer is attracted to just to get him to try to kill her but everything will be okay see because not only will guttenberg keep a close watch on her and not only will he alert the police a few minutes after she enters this dive but she will keep a can of mace handy just in case i ask you the alert viewer does this scenario unfold as planned elizabeth mcgovern has a quirkily interesting bone structure she seems all mandible and tiny mouth at times but she s vibrant steve guttenberg has hair on his brawn and that s about it otherwise he s as helpless as the character he plays if isabelle huppert can act it isn t evident in this film the killer is so formed and so groomed that he looks like he s wearing one of those masks of deformity in that twilight zone episode about greedy heirs didn t the director curtis hanson go on to make l a confidential that was a nicely done piece of work here everything seems clumsy and contrived down to the small bit parts just before the inevitable violent climax a uniformed police officer is introduced to delay mcgovern s rescue and the scene is embarrassing to watch dick olsen has a bit part as a late shopper he s a neat guy and always reliable paul shenar as the cuckolded hubby has a striking face that seems made for the stage and he does a fine job too that louche joint where mcgovern attracts the attention of the murderer where she plays pool with a couple of hairy apes was shot at a bar in carolina beach in north carolina not far from where i lived the way the interior is set up it s clear that this is supposed to be a dangerous and dirty dive actually it appears rather more elegant on screen than it did in reality overall this is hitchcock territory and it brings tears to the eyes to imagine what he would have done with this story
rodney dangerfield isn t the main character of this movie he s barely in it most of the screen time is dominated by unfunny jokes one running gag is that a character is named jerk off there are also lots of erection jokes where the punch line is someone has an erection this movie is as funny as kirstie ally s british accent is convincing this movie started off like a weak action movie five minutes of back story and then bam unfunny jokes but aside from the terrible writing the movie is also poorly directed and the acting is terrible also this movie does the old bad comedy clich of having lots of well known b movie actors harland williams gilbert godfried randy quaid and phil la mar these are just some of the people that spend more time on the screen than rodney even though he s billed as the main character don t be surprised to find this movie at a drug store selling for five bucks even that is too much
many people like to point to this tv movie when arguing with the vast legions of hanks philes out there that tom did in fact make crappy films i think bachelor party was great but that s another story the movie focuses on a dungeons and dragons style game that eventually drives our young gump to hallucinatory madness the story is charmingly early s focusing as it does on the imminent threat to our youth posed by those evil role playing games i however prefer to view mazes and monsters as the turning point in the whatever happened to chris makepeace story we all remember him as rudy the rabbit in meatballs and as the hapless clifford in my bodyguard where he gave us all a vicarious thrill by beating the crap out of matt dillon few could argue especially those of us who read dynamite on a regular basis that great things were in store for him and then came rona jaffe the line between bad acting and bad writing is razor thin so i leave it to you to decide whose fault makepeace s performance in this is all i know is that the last major release i saw him in was vamp and that was he had a small role as sean penn s brother in falcon and the snowman but by that time the brat pack torch had been passed to others with straighter hair and flashier resumes i can t in good conscience recommend this movie watch it if only to see a younger more idealistic chris makepeace before rona jaffe feasted on his soul
it is enjoyable and fast paced there is no way on earth that the actor playing mat could be eighteen however the main thing is that he does act eighteen very convincingly it must be a credit to his audition that he convinced them to cast him i quite soon accepted him as being a naive young country boy while his was the best performance most of the others were also very engaging in particular the interplay between the policemen was natural and well balanced and worked very well it is only about minutes long so the plot is not complex more key is the style of the whole thing it is very slick and vibrant and the backdrops are atmospheric especially from the fact that all the colours are extremely rich the gangland is identifiable to foreign audiences but still manages to be distinctly australian
big hair big boobs bad music and a giant safety pin these are the words to best describe this terrible movie i love cheesy horror movies and i ve seen hundreds but this had got to be on of the worst ever made the plot is paper thin and ridiculous the acting is an abomination the script is completely laughable the best is the end showdown with the cop and how he worked out who the killer is it s just so damn terribly written the clothes are sickening and funny in equal measures the hair is big lots of boobs bounce men wear those cut tee shirts that show off their stomachs sickening that men actually wore them and the music is just synthesiser trash that plays over and over again in almost every scene there is trashy music boobs and paramedics taking away bodies and the gym still doesn t close for bereavement all joking aside this is a truly bad film whose only charm is to look back on the disaster that was the s and have a good old laugh at how bad everything was back then
this film is so bad dialogues story actors and actresses everything that it s hard to imagine that we ll see a worse movie this year or in the following years love s brother set in australia among italian immigrants has nothing but shallow clich s about italian culture to offer and it is quite telling that even the italians from and in italy speak english in the film the message of the film ugly people have to marry ugly people beautiful people have to marry beautiful people is truly discomforting giovanni ribisi is quite good in films like suburbia or lost in translation but here his pseudo italian accent is hard to bear see this film at your own risk trash as trash can
bottom of the barrel unimaginative and practically unwatchable remake of the road warrior this film follows the exact plot as the filipino film stryker and is worse by far bad acting dialog effects dubbing pacing action sequences the list goes on and on italy made literally dozens of road warrior rip offs in the early s some good some bad this is the worst by far no contest not only was the mood of the film completely bleak and miserable the experience of sitting through this one is a bore and a half there was one good chase sequence towards the beginning of the movie and a cool shot of a man holding a hand grenade exploding but everything else about this movie seriously reeks for actual post nuke fun go track down a copy of endgame after the fall of new york or escape from the bronx instead they re much more enjoyable than this rubbish
what we have here is a downright brilliant piece of early s incompetence that will render even the biggest connoisseur of trash cinema completely speechless wizards of the lost kingdom is a very cheap and cheesy fantasy sword and sorcery adventure that doesn t have an actual plot but does eagerly shamelessly borrows elements from other films writer ed naha and hector olivera who watched enough similar type of movies to know that they needed a handful of essential characters but probably figured that all the rest would follow automatically in order to make a fantasy adventure you need one super evil villain preferably with a black cape one young hero in training one lone warrior one amiable type of furry pet one wise midget living in the woods optional and a whole colorful collection of hideous demons enslaved dwarfs and winged gargoyles to serve as filler the story is phenomenal and so original with simon the young son of a wizard having to flee from his beloved kingdom after the evil magician shurka takes over the power and killed the king simon wants to go back and save the people but therefore he needs his powerful ring which he lost during his escape simon befriends lone warrior kor the usually cool dude bo svenson who clearly needed the pay check who assists simon during the long and devastating journey full of ordeals dangerous encounters and magical showdowns admittedly it doesn t even sound too bad thus far but that s merely just because i excluded all the deliciously inept little details simon has a best friend named gulfax for example gulfax is an albino version of chewbacca and evokes incontrollable chuckles whenever he opens his poodle snout to yelp something incomprehensible the obstacles during journey back home are hilariously irrelevant to the plot and simply serve as padding footage to cover up the lack of actual content simon has nightmarish visions inside the tent of a suspicious forest nymph kor settles an old score with the pig faced nemesis whose sister he refused to marry and there s the supposedly horrible suicide cave where you can only sing your way out of but the absolute most unequally brilliant sequence not just of this film alone but in the history of cinema involves the resurrection of four zombie warriors simon awakes the legendary courageous warriors hoping they will assist them in their battle but the rotting corpses only take a few steps complain about how tired they are and return back to their graves that s it so much for the zombie sub plot best sequence ever i could go on listing unintentionally hilarious little details for several more paragraphs but you get the idea wizards of the lost kingdom is a tremendously messed up so bad it s good film word of advice do not watch this joyful piece of junk alone invite friends preferably the dope headed types with a wicked sense of humor and watch it in group it will be a night to remember
i noticed fire was on cable the other night and i began watching it because i couldn t recall anything specific about it other than i remember it being a horrible film when i saw it back in twenty years later the film is still awful besides the synthesizer the saxophone was the most abused instrument in pop music during the s as is evident in the title song hearing that song again made me want to jab a screwdriver in my ears to end the sonic misery inflicted upon them and to compound this musical assault rob lowe s character played saxophone and there was one scene where he played a solo that went on and on like he was charlie parker only his shrill tone and playing were more reminiscent of a monkey playing a kazoo all the characters were intensely unappealing although i must say they did a great job of casting equally unappealing actors to portray them actually i thought mare winningham was appealing and i initially felt sorry for her character because she wore funny underwear but then near the end of the movie she decides to have sex with rob lowe s character who would probably be voted most likely to transfer a variety of sexual diseases if such thing were voted upon
how do you spell washed up fat italian who can barely pull off a martial arts move without needing some heart medication in this movie we see steven seagal at his lowest level of accomplishment since his career started it has been a steady decline into pathetic over indulgent behavior that has scuttled his career in this movie it looks like most of his training consisted of ordering the fetuccini alfredo at his restaurant every day he is fat slow and very old looking in this movie hardly a martial arts action hero more like a laughing stock clown it s time for steven seagal to retire this movie is about hours of reasons why plot fat italian guy with a big reputation on the force gets wind that a crime group may be playing around with a drug designed by the military to create the ultimate warrior response this pretense although pathetic and laughable gives opportunity for some over the top fight scenes that include blasting through walls like a comic book did i mention this movie totally sucks and steven seagal is a complete joke yeah i did
while filming an s horror movie called hot blooded the director is brutally murdered and the leading lady is scarred as she survives the attack and manages to kill murderer after all of this the production is abandoned and the stock reels are left to gather dust so a group of filmmakers decide to pick up where the film left off even though they re warned by people to keep away from the film as the last person who was interested in the flick turned up dead in the cinema while watching the film from this it s labelled as a cursed production not taking these warnings seriously the crew goes ahead with the production and they get the original star of the movie to return from hollywood to reprise her role but not as the daughter but the mother but again the murders start occurring with the cast and crew getting butchered by an unknown figure dressed up as the film s killer look what scream started hey i enjoy those films but mostly everything else that followed on afterwards were annoying and pointless excuses during this stage the sub genre came back with vengeance but it wasn t much of a good thing as they were mostly unsuccessful and unoriginal attempts where they followed the derivative pattern of the scream franchise cut which is an independent australian take on the textbook slasher genre is purely shonky garbage that lacks basically everything and shamelessly knocks off every other slasher flick but you know what i found it a cheesy delight yeah it s gawd awful and highly forgettable but it s a bit of ala good cheap fun while it lasted although i did hate it when i originally came across it but the second time around i knew what i was getting myself into and it worked better for it it was just like helping myself to a nice slice cheesecake again but this time it wasn t so sweet the film came out around the same time as scream and urban legends the final cut did which all three follow the same structure of using a movie within a movie scream is obviously the strongest of the three but i would actually watch this trash over urban legends the final cut though it did seem more of a throwback to the s slashers than that of one of scream s bastard offspring pretty much the film is given b grade treatment and that shows up in the script and performances the dialog is truly unimaginative and hardly comes up with any surprises and suspense while the performances are pure mockery and molly ringwald takes the crown for it she plays the wash up actress returning to finish the cursed flick and i had good fun with her laughably ridiculous send up performance she provides the bite here and nails it down perfectly the rest were mostly recognizable australian tv stars that s if you re an australian with a ravishing jessica napier leading the cast with the likes of stephen curry and frank roberts also pop singer and supposed actress kylie minogue makes a cameo appearance in the opening just to be hacked up nice these teens mostly followed the formula of horny and dim witted kids that have nothing better to do but to be killed sometimes it feels like they just waiting in queue because they have no real substance to be there the plot starts off rather interestingly then heads into a mystery phase where red herrings pop up but then it makes a sudden u turn where it becomes a somewhat satire on the horror genre simply it s rather choppy and when it comes to the explanation for all of this madness i was kind of left thinking oh my this when it tries to twist back onto itself in a clever manner but sadly it falls along way but don t you just love an opening ending also it sports some pop culture references and a self referential tongue in cheek approach predictability makes its way in rather early and the jokes can become over stated at times but it knows that by poking fun at itself quite a bit the atmosphere looses a bit of edge because of the humour taking away the bleakness but still the isolated grand old mansion where they are filming has some neat touches that added some spookiness the cinema scene is done rather nicely too now now we know we want gore and nudity when watching this type of flick but sadly there s no nudity to be found and the gore is pretty standard if lacking but it s more then decent for such low budget flick there are one or two creative deaths but the rest are systematic the killer wasn t bad but when he spoke it kind of hurt it i thought well the smart ass attitude didn t sit well with me another notes of the production which were dire ranged from the cut away editing out of place soundtrack and kimble rendall s direction lacked execution and was pretty careless but these contributing factors pull together to add some sort of sheer entertainment to all of this badness the imagination matches the budget that s for sure but heck this lousy slasher wasn t trying to be anything else pure schlock that s slightly amusing
at least it s not full of sensless violence or fluff it s also not very full of thought or a smooth storyline this story had some potential but the director appears to have lost site of the green the story is disjointed and goes off in strangedirections to no conclusion i also don t believe the director spent much time around a golf country club either some of the depictions are absurd not very engaging
alicianne laurel barnett becomes a live in babysitter for young rosalie nordon rosalione cole who has recently lost her mother but rosalie misses her dead mother a lot and continuously visits her grave conveniently located in a cemetery right behind the house late at night where she also meets her friends this starts off good with a truly eerie sequence in the cemetery then falls apart the story is thin and there is tons of padding to make the film minutes long the acting is terrible across the board with cole easily being the worst badly directed with some of the worst editing i ve ever seen in a motion picture scenes and sound are just cut off with no rhyme or reason also the film has terrible and obvious post production sound as for blood and violence forget it there s very little and what there is looks incredibly fake i ve never seen such fake looking blood looks like ketchup boring pointless a rightfully forgotten drive in movie you can skip this one
my grandmother took me and my sister out to see this movie when it came out in theaters back in and so we happily bought the tickets the popcorn and soda and walked right in to the theater and sat down to watch the movie when it was over the audience didn t applauded strongly i remember that i heard a few people say that they didn t like it at all i didn t like it i thought that it was rather stupid and not worth seeing eddie murphy was hysterical in this but apart from him the whole movie was bad i rarely laughed at the parts in this i also remembered that the other people in the theater almost hardly even laughed and what i really thought was bad was making the animals talk because talking animals only exist in cartoons in live action movies they are totally a mutt i said that apart from eddie murphy s hysterical twist he brings in this movie is not worth watching it is rather stupid i have seen eddie murphy in several of movies and i thought that he was funny in those i have just said that he was the only funny part of this movie i also have not seen eddie murphy in the really great movie the adventures of pluto nash this movie is not a movie that i would really recommend that you see because apart from eddie murphy you probably are not going to like this especially because of a lot the the talking animals in it i ll give this movie a rating of stars out of a possible stars
i had two reasons for watching this swashbuckler when it aired on danish television yesterday first of all i wanted to see gina lollobrigida and here i wasn t disappointed she looked gorgeous second of all through reading about the film i had gotten the impression that it featured absurd humor not unlike that which can be found in philippe de broca s films on this account however i was sadly disappointed i found the jokes predictable apart from a few witty remarks on the topic of war and the characters completely one dimensional also the action scenes were done in a strangely mechanical and uninspired fashion with no sense of drama at all i kept watching until the end but i got bored very quickly and just sat there waiting for the scenes with lollobrigida
simply terrible why wouldn t you use actual actors look this has to stop stop using non actors if you want any credibility or any message sent via these low budget films please for the love of god use real actors most will work for free take advantage of that now back to my comment anyway the humour was lower than that of the bathroom variety and wasn t funny on any level as for the quality in one scene filmed on a public transportation bus you could see the reflection of the crew guess what it was one guy with what looked like a sony camcorder and probably not even his well i assume the only audience for this film are people with a gore fetish and it wasn t even good gore
although i had no earthly idea on what to expect from this movie this sure as hell wasn t what i would have had in mind had anything actually come to mind once i heard of its existence all i knew was that i had to own a movie called please don t eat the babies unfortunately i could only find a copy under its alternate title island fury looking back i guess i could call it a lose lose situation on one hand i still don t get to be known as the guy who owns a movie called please don t eat the babies and on the other hand island fury would ultimately reveal itself to be an awful pointless boring unwatchable piece of garbage yeah definitely lose lose i m not even sure what genre they re going for here just early s badness with a flashback that might actually be longer than the non flashback first up two teenage girls are being chased by two bad guys once caught the bad guys bring to our attention that one of the girls have a coin on a string around her neck and somehow these bad guys know of a lot more of these coins hidden on an island somewhere and this is where things start to get weird somehow these guys know of a trip the girls took to some island years earlier when they were only i guess this is supposed to mean that the girls should know exactly where this alleged treasure is so now we re in the past while the girls try to retrace their steps so these bad guys don t kill them although i wouldn t have minded if they had in the flashback the year old counterparts are on a boat trip with their sisters and the sisters boyfriends eventually stopping by an island for some air they get mixed up with some kid and his killer grandparents any potential suspense or reasons to keep on watching never shows up but the flashback was undeniably better than the present which still isn t saying much for a while there i had forgotten about the original story at one point i ithought maybe the director had too and when the flashback ended that would be the end which would have worked for me considering this disappointment would have been a half hour shorter this pointless movie within a pointless movie does eventually end and real stuff does happen but it s stupid i guess i didn t exactly expect a movie filled with infants being devoured or anything like that but i did expect some form of outlandish b entertainment mostly just a confusing inept storyline unsure of its genre my advice would be to seek out something worthwhile like attack of the beast creatures if anyone i would only recommend this one to serious b movie collectors who must have them all anyone else interested probably has brain damage what really gets me is that i still have no idea why they called it please don t eat the babies
this pile of sh t is tied in my book as the worst thing ever made i can t believe that someone actually relased this crap let alone acually made it horrible horrible horrible not even worth mentioning the damn story or any details about it that s how bad it actually is avoid it like sars
i have to admit that i stuck this one out thinking something would have to happen besides the dead body in the first scenes and her disposal of him i was wrong it was a cinema verite of betty hits the beach encased for the first part by mordant morven i really don t care what young lassies from scotland do these days who thy screw what drugs they take visually the stroll through the cabo de gata in andalucia was pleasant and surely the high point for me the nadir was the chop shop for her dead boyfriend as the movie came to a close i had two thoughts that s all there is now i see why her boyfriend killed himself rename it bare bitch boredom or what i did on my trip to spain i m such a sucker for sticking these things out
i m a fan of columbo especially on a rainy saturday and it was fun to see oskar werner after fahrenheit but this episode was very lacking the original plot and plot twists were obvious and could be guessed way in advance even years before the modern detective shows of today but it was amusing to see the crazy couch patterns and modern electronics equipment and of course the mandatory suburbanite humor poking fun at modern art for sale the high tech home is a jetson s or disney version of tomorrowland and fun to think of writers inventing those way out gizmos if its sunny outside go play as there are much better columbo episodes still we should be thankful for cable tv that these episodes are being broadcast
in an attempt to bring back the teen slasher genre that was taken away by spoofs like scary movie and shriek if you know what i did last friday the th valentine fails why did people like halloween because it was original new and went beyond anything that s ever been done why did they like scream because at least it made sense valentine is just a stupid slasher flick that has hardly any gore what so ever the plot is so similar to halloween and urban legend it s not funny and the moment the killer comes on screen you know who it is it s just sssssssssssooooooooooooo predictable the teen slasher genre is dead get over it out of
there are so many goofy things about this movie that i can t possibly name but a few bogart s character his name whip mccord too easy so i ll leave it at that boy it makes humphrey sound good his long curly hair and silly sideburns his black bart get up complete with spurs not sure what shade of lipgloss they ve got him wearing but it ain t none too flattering cagney s character jim kincaid his lipstick doesn t do him any favors either the man is being swallowed by his hat during the entire film could they not find a hat to fit him even a little his pants are too tight in the rear he blows the smoke off his gun one too many times if you know what i mean and i think you do if you are a casual bogart or cagney fan and figure it might be a change of pace to see them in a western do yourself a favor and forget that thought even the horses look embarrassed that is when they don t look bored in all fairness i admit that westerns are my least favorite film genre but i ve still seen much much better than this on a comedy level or as high camp the oklahoma kid works otherwise it s viewer beware therefore see this only if a you must see every western out there b you are a true cagney or bogie completist c any of the above comments appeal to you woah
who were they kidding with this there was just too much in this film that was hard to digest right from when arjun ajay devgan unknowingly wishes death on his father to when he arrives in london with his uncle played by om puri only to abandon him minutes later the only problem with that theory is that anybody who has ever passed through london heathrow knows that such a f te would be impossible to pull off and especially not by an indian but the film problems do not end there there s the issue of the two main leads salman khan and ajay devgan passing as rock stars on the verge of achieving their dreams i mean yeah we saw success come to susan boyle a woman in the uk achieving her dreams after age but that was a rare case it was really hard for me to suspend my disbelief because i felt that the casting of salman and ajay was just ill conceived they would never cast madhuri dixit and sridevi to play the same roles so why should we be forced to watch ajay devgan and salman khan men well into their s prance around desperately trying to hang on to their s let s not even talk about the most self conscious actress on screen today asin this is her second film that i have seen and she is just hopeless as an actress so conscious of her looks that she only concerns herself with looking good and voguing for the camera rather than giving in a good acting performance it s just hard to believe that she turned down all those other movie roles to star in this fluff and then be so fluffy as an actress nothing to write home about at all and to top all of that the film just boringly dragged on there s nothing special about it at all trust me you will predict every clich d thing that is going to happen in it
this film has its good points hot chicks people diethe problem the hot chicks barley get nude and you don t get to see many of the people dieing mostly just lots of fast movements and screaming though there were two good kill scenes also for those of you watching this for jenna jameson she is just a side chearator with a very small role and minor nude scenes what this film needed script and story would be nice but i will not complain about that simply put it needs more nudity and better kill scenes cuz lets face it that is why we watch these flicks i wouldn t waste my money on it and if you must wait until it s on the old shelves at your local video store
and a budget and this movie still looks like it was made for you can tell from the first frame to the last that he didn t care one bit about the movies continuity or plot he was just happy to be making a zombie movie what the end result shows is a lazy film maker who loves zombie movies it could have been great if he just had of given a care the end result is endless zoom ins on poorly done gore and even more poorly produced metal plays over it what happens when you combine high hopes big dreams a decent budget hard work and one idiot behind the camera
freddy s dead the final nightmare the sixth installment of the nightmare on elm street series and once again another bad sequel i think this is tied up with the last sequel of the dream child i was lucky enough to get the nightmare on elm street series box dvd set for my birthday so i got to see all the sequels may i say that i m just getting more and more disappointed though with these sequels at least the past two it just seems like freddy lost his edge it s almost like the writers were trying to give freddy a soul and they re just destroying it instead of reinventing the story this was a sequel that wasn t needed sorry to robert englund but this was very much below what freddy krueger represents freddy is back but he s got something we don t know about a daughter maggie she s not aware that he is her father but soon she finds out what his dark secrets are and he wants her help she has to do her best to resist his powers but it s hard with all the good memories she has of her loving father ironic isn t it but freddy isn t giving up without manipulating her into his ways freddy s dead the final nightmare is also presented in d radical huh note the sarcasm this is one of the worst sequels it s tied up with the fifth sequel of the nightmare on elm street series i d rather watch the second nightmare on elm street to be honest this just had bad acting stupid editing and just over all a bad idea for a story i didn t like the concept of it and it just ruined the whole idea of who freddy krueger really is the death master of nightmares not father knows best
where to start i feel violated thats right violated i just spent hrs of my life hrs that i could have spent doing something more useful like watching paint dry on this so called horror flick its not scary its not funny its not dramatic its no action its nothing its predictable its boring its tragic i might come of a bit harsh here but watch this movie and you will feel the same way or no don t watch it unless you want to feel violated also
some year olds behave like teenagers coping with the death of a high school mate trying to find their purpose in live and love the script is so lame that i had to force myself to even finish this movie stay away from it
first off this is no where near as bad as some of the other trash the sci fi channel has produced that isn t to say that grendel is a good film in fact it is very bad but it definitely had potential to be a lot better the flaws of the film come from character design character absurd additions to the story the visual effects the music and for the most part the acting when speaking of character design i of course mean the way our heroes and villains look beowulf and the other danes seem like ridiculous vikings rather than warriors of brute strength that helmet our main protagonist wears is just too silly grendel looks like the hulk but with strange tentacle attachments to his elbows the characters are very limited beowulf is same from beginning to end however finn a useless sidekick achieved some two dimensionality due thanks to his romantic subplot and unferth gets some notion as well as he becomes less conceited much like finn there are useless additions to this story to make it its own while still holding to the source material the crossbow that is gifted to beowulf is so ridiculous i m surprised the cast didn t walk off the set besides additions there s omissions such as the underlying themes of christianity and paganism as well as the consequences of lying the special effects are mighty terrible grendel and his mother hag are poorly conceived and as such they re portrayal on screen is less than believable the music is overbearing especially when a character dies all in all this is not sci fi s worst film to date no it is actually one of the better films though trash it still it is it is good trash making it a guilty pleasure at best the only thing that works is the dialogue which is still wooden here and there i highly recommend you skip this film and watch robert zemeckis take on the ancient story of beowulf simply because this film grendel is only half the tale and not the whole thing which garners this movie a three star review
i am a huge huge fan of john cusack samuel l jackson and tony shalhoub i m slightly less fond of stephen king but i like some of his work this said i should have loved possible spoilers after this point i walked in eager i walked out disappointed this is not the fault of the actors shalhoub and jackson both have very small roles because the premise of the movie puts cusack in the guy in a locked room scenario this wasn t a bad movie but i can t call it a good one either it was a muddied mess that had moments of ouch that s just wrong combined with moments of ouch that s just painful and moments of oh now that s just unfortunate with very little continuity connectivity between them eislin s father shows up once and there s no seeming connection to the rest of mike s personal life that we see displayed while he tries to survive the room a previous commenter described the olin enslin argument as worth watching and i very much agree but other than that aside from some clever musical cues the room almost playfully torments enslin a little bit and gives him one chance to get out before upping the ante at which point it gives him the one hour countdown clock and the titular line from the carpenters we ve only just begun it s mostly stuff jumps out at you when you least expect it type horror that was fun when i was fourteen and surrounded by friends my age clutching each other in the summer while jason stalked camp crystal lake the rest of the movie was let s make him relive some of his most painful experiences mindgaming with let s animate the paintings in creepy ways clich cheesiness end spoilers i expected better from this movie with stephen king s name attached to it as well as the actors i mentioned above we never find out the origin of the evil we never get to see the evil defeated though we can presume maybe it was defeated and the ending was just a jarring what moment wait for it to come on cable i wouldn t have minded paying for it as a matin e but i m feeling a bit shortchanged for having paid opening night prices for it
i have been familiar with the fantastic book of goodnight mister tom for absolutely ages and it was only recently when i got the chance to watch this adaption of it i have heard lots of positive remarks about this so i had high hopes once this film had finished i was horrified this film is not a good film at all goodnight mister tom was an extremely poor adaption and practically of the book was missed out particularly i found that a lot of the characters and some great scenes in the book were not in this there was not much dialogue it was rushed and far too fast moving but i was mostly upset by the fact that you never got to see the bonding and love between william beech and tom in this film which was a true let down the casting was not all that good either i thought this could have been really good but it was so different to the book anextremely poor adaption one of the worst i ve seen this deserves a decent remake that d better be times better than this pile of garbage
normally i m not motivated to write reviews but this movie was so excruciatingly painful i feel i must i cringed at the appallingly predictable plot the lame acting and laughed at moments which were supposed to be tense indeed most of the audience seemed pretty bored and chatty even at the most tense moment of the movie molly ringwald stood out as the only performance of any merit in a tortured production even the twist at the end wasn t i ve heard it said that the movie didn t take itself seriously but i could find little evidence of that in the movie cut should have been left on the cutting room floor do yourself a favour and spend your time and money on something else
i was sadly disappointed by this film due to the fact that it felt false and the characters were not strong enough to carry the films pretty weak attempt at horror the basic idea for the film was interesting but unfortunately it wasn t able to excite really scare or shock me there was one part in the entire film that i thought was gruesome but even that didn t redeem it i did get to like the character of kate by the end of the film as she seemed to soften and become a little more realistic by the end the character played by jeremy sheffield was not actually needed for this film and i think the director writer got carried away with the myriad of characters used for no purpose if he had left it at the basic characters making it more of a solo effort on kate s part it may have worked jeremy s acting was wooden to say the least and i felt uncomfortable watching the bad on screen chemistry or lack of it such a shame disappointing
i read tom robbins even cowgirls get the blues as a teenager i loved every word it was sexy funny and full of glamorous scenery and beautiful writing but when i saw the movie i could not believe what a dull sour joyless piece of junk it was how did this happen i think someone in hollywood read this book and filed it under gay pride women lesbians that s the library of congress subject heading now anyone over who reads the book will know it has nothing to do with real lesbians any more than star wars is about real space travel the book was obviously and i do mean obviously written by a heterosexual male who loves the idea of lesbians in the nude all the time but has never really met one still someone in hollywood said uh oh better give this to a gay director or gay people will make trouble so they handed it to gus van sant nothing against the man but however gay he may really be he has not a clue as to how to make a funny film gus van sant took a straight man s playful fantasy of guilt free girl girl action and male voyeurism turned it into a dull literal minded lesbian power recruiting poster it s like turning an oscar wilde comedy into an arthur miller tragedy not pretty the main clue that gus van sant had absolutely no idea what to do with the source material is the riotously bad casting his clout allowed him to hire the very best his ignorance of the novel s real subtext a straight man s fantasy not a gay pride recruiting poster caused him to make choices that were not only bad but bizarre let s meet the cast of even cowgirls get the blues pat morita as the chink okay there are few name recognition asian actors and pat morita in happy days was fairly funny but casting him as the chink was wrong wrong wrong pat morita has no idea that the chink is a very funny man gus didn t tell him pat also doesn t seem to know that the chink is well sexy in the book he s not wise old mr miyagi he s more like hugh hefner he s a randy old goat and he knows a lot about pleasing the nubile and responsive sissy and bonanza jellybean you see in the book they aren t really lesbians do you get that this is a straight man s fantasy yet john hurt as the countess okay he s a gay friendly man but he is a serious shakespearean actor you need someone who is fun and camp for this role for john hurt to be cast as a goofy guy like the countess is tragic and sad i kept expecting paul scofield to wander in all dressed up as thomas more and sadly shake his head now richard you know you ve lost your soul entirely for shame my former student and yes john hurt was funny and pretty gay as caligula but that was black humor not playful and breezy humor like the book rain phoenix as bonanza jellybean no talent no training no problem except that in the book bonanza is funny playful cheerful mostly heterosexual and loving in the movie she s sullen passive expressionless and dull as for her taste for women robbins in the book puts it like this god knows i love women but nothing can take the place of a man that fits uh gus did you read this book uma thurman as sissy hankshaw this is a tough role in the book sissy really is an unusually passive and timid heroine still a more accomplished actress might have manufactured a twinkle in her eye or a sway in her walk to imply some sort of hidden strength or hidden enjoyment of her adventures uma doesn t pull it off probably because gus never told her sissy is supposed to enjoy being a hitch hiker with a beautiful body and giant thumbs uma plays it more like she s in a tv movie about a girl dying of leukemia this movie is sour and dull and i accuse you gus van sant
reed diamond plays a man suffering from amnesia who s been in a mental asylum for over a decade after he was found wondering the back roads with blood on his hands the doctors want to test out an experimental new drug that ll return his lost memories if it works but when the drugs give him hallucinations of a demon he chooses to escape instead while outside he befriends a young boy whose stepfather greg grunberg mistreats his mother won t let her near the darkroom in his basement acts suspicious in general while the general mystery of the film is a tad easy to identify way before it s revealed i found mr diamond s acting to be enthralling enough to keep my attention throughout in the interest of full disclosure i ve been a huge fan of his since homicide and his brief but extremely pivotal role in the shield up through journeyman dollhouse not a great film nor a good one but serviceable enough although i did like it better than the previous films that i ve seen from director writer michael hurst room pumkinhead mansquito eye candy one fleeting pair of boobs in a hallucinationmy grade c
ok so it was written in before so you can give it a little credit for worrying about terrorists and the idea that the cia director makes a plot to blow this doomed plane out of the sky before it brings doom to the world is prescient that s it that s the good stuff the acting fair the plot silly the twist unnecessary dooooooooooom it isn t as though no one ever thought of what to do when a plane gets contaminated don t you think bureaucrats have a manual for plagues and how to contain them proper execution of such a plan is always a problem as we saw after katrina but they have a plan it isn t to send them off to iceland and then to mauritania and if the virus is carried in the air why was the plane door open and the shooters standing there with no protection in fact did it ever occur to anyone to shoot her legs that would stop her but not as dramatic i m a sucker i always watch a movie to see the end once i started it but this was a waste of time and for the most part predictable i saw it using a recorder so i didn t have to watch all the ads that was a plus it s a good example of why i watch so little network tv rubbish
a childless couple brooke adams jeff hayenga go to a doctor james karen to try to conceive it works but adams slowly becomes aware that there s something seriously wrong with the baby pretty interesting idea is thoroughly done in by a lousy script the basic idea is ok but becomes screamingly predictable towards the end i saw every twist coming the direction is poor he seems to have no idea how to shoot a basic scene the production values are to be nice lousy very shabby and the gore scenes are too unpleasant i almost turned it off when a pregnant woman started stabbing herself in the stomach with lousy special effects the film completely derails at the end when it becomes quite clear they had no idea how to end this film some good acting makes it somewhat bearable adams hayenga and karen are all good at their roles and kept me watching but that was about it this film barely got released in and still remains unknown it s easy to see why i give it a
first of all what the hell why in the world are they trying to sell a low budget piece of crap on late night tv with the promise of disturbing offensive sick garbage that any normal real human being with a soul couldn t watch what the crap is funny about a dog being injured a grandma getting her head knocked off a guy getting his hand blown to pieces and two girls going to the bathroom what in the hell has this world come to that people find comedy in some thing so completely sick anyone who thinks this kind of material is funny should not even be allowed to walk the earth but from what i hear its not even offensive so they promise comedy through demented piles of sick garbage and they cant even pull that off
after stopping by the movie store to find something to watch we stumbled on this it looked appealing from the summary at least so we gave it a try and here s the kicker the first minutes are interesting it s actually enjoyable oh wait spoke too soon somewhere in there the movie took a disgusting turn into fundamental right wing christian brain washing not entirely sure what happens but i think the screenplay writer found god somewhere in there finished writing this script and had no time to edit it because he had a kkk meeting to get to with his friends from the westboro church and his hood wasn t clean can they put warnings on this i refuse to support this religious idiocy much like video games have rating systems movies need some sort of symbol maybe a small cross in the bottom corner to show us that a movie is going to take a turn for the worse unless you share sentiments with whatever moron came up with this story and will have your bible open in your lap while you watch this and plan on how you ll convert your neighbors don t waste your time it s some of the worst junk that s come out in a very long time and the radical religious nuts don t need anymore funding
primal species dir jonathan winfrey international terrorists get a surprise when their cargo turn out to contain living dinosaurs the army commando team now have to think fast if they want to prevent the extinction of the human species instead of the reptiles you look at the cover and you gain your first impressions of the film that is pretty much it the acting is only just acceptable from a few characters the story is poor with the whole film based on the army and the marines trying to kill the dinosaurs this film came out three years after jurassic park instead this film looks to have come out years before jurassic park the dinosaurs costumes are so poorly made and i do mean costumes there are obviously people dressed up and this film makes no attempts at hiding this a scene when a dinosaur runs down a corridor is created in a way in which it looks like someone is riding the creature the is one good thing which comes out of this film the short running time at only hour and minutes it doesn t waste too much of your life but still try to avoid it altogether it s like a friday the th nightmare officer brian currie
the first home alone was one of the funniest movies of the s the second was just as funny with the same cast and jokes now comes home alone i was curious how they could continue with the same story considering kevin would ve been by he could take care of himself right so what does the director decide to do he takes a child just as annoying and makes him sick the kid is like years old and the mother leaves him alone in the house what kind of team of burgerlers are these idiots i don t really want to get too into detail if you want to sadly see this movie but please i d recommend that you d stay away from it it s not worth your precious time go fold a piece of paper do chores balance a pencil on your nose or take a nap it s better to do then to watch home alone
the plot certainly seemed interesting enough how can a real life brutal murder be turned into a truly boring movie well you can watch wonderland and find out i had heard of the wonderland murders before this film was released and found it to be an interesting true story of some genuinely sadistic people unfortunately there is zero character development so we never get a chance to understand why any of this was done or get a good sense of the interrelationships between the characters the pace of the direction was very tedious this all leads to an extraordinarily boring movie given that dawn schiller a central character as holmes s girlfriend was an associate producer and that holmes s wife was a consultant on the film we should have had the opportunity to gain some real insight into the characters
daddy s girls florence lawrence and dorothy west receive some terrific news at the local post office unaware they are being stalked by burglar charles inslee meanwhile father david miles receives a message from young robert harron which necessitates daddy leaving home so when the young women return they can be home alone as the vulnerable pair bed down for the evening the local grand ball of the black and tans gets underway and a dark skinned drinker portends additional danger for d w griffith s dynamic duo mr inslee has one of his better biograph roles stealing the film from the girls and daddy ironically director griffith appears as one of the black faced extras at the black and tans ball biograph girls lawrence and west are suggestive of later griffith girls lillian and dorothy gish especially in orphans of the storm and they are excessively affectionate in bed the racist tone is unfortunate since the story of a burglar redeemed by saving his potential victims from a greater danger is intriguing the girls and daddy d w griffith florence lawrence dorothy west charles inslee
this movie seemed like it was going to be better than it ended up being the cinematography is good the acting seemed solid the dialogue wasn t too stiff but then about twenty minutes in there s this long scene with a doctor who you know is actually a patient at the asylum pretending to be a doctor and it just goes south from there on top of that the demon is about the silliest looking hellspawn since the godzilla looking thing in curse of the demon there s also some odd demon worshippers who wear masks that look like the exploding teens from the beginning of logan s run in the end the cinematography couldn t save this movie despite some pretty solid performances by the actors the story just doesn t go anywhere i think hellbored would have been a better title for this
laugh clown laugh released in stars the legendary lon chaney as a circus clown named tito tito has raised a foundling a young and beautiful loretta young to adulthood and names her simonetta tito has raised the girl in the circus life and she has become an accomplished ballerina while chaney gives his usual great performance i could not get past the fact that tito now well into middle age has the hots for the young simonetta although he is not her biological father he has raised her like a daughter that kind of ick factor permeates throughout the film tito competes for simonetta s affections with a young and handsome count luigi nils asther simonetta clearly falls for the young man but feels guilt about abandoning tito out of loyalty not romantic love the whole premise of the film is ridiculous and i find it amazing that no one in the film tells tito what a stupid old fool he is being until he reveals it himself at the end the film is noteworthy only because of loretta young who would go on to have a great career while i adore chaney s brilliance as an actor this whole film seems off to me and just downright creepy
ned kelly ledger the infamous australian outlaw and legend sort of like robin hood with a mix of billy the kid australians love the legend of how he stood up against the english aristocratic oppression and united the lower classes to change australia forever the fact that the lower classes of the time were around immigrant criminals seems to be casually skimmed around by this film indeed quite a few so called facts in this film are on reflection a tad dubious i suppose the suspicions should have been aroused when in the opening credits it was claimed that this film is based upon the book our sunshine if ever a romanticized version of truth could be seen in a name for a book there it was this wasn t going to be a historical epic but just an adaptation of one of many dubious legends of ned kelly albeit a harsh and sporadically brutal version unfortunately ned kelly is nothing more than an overblown hallmark channel real life historical drama wannabe the story plods along at an alarming rate alarming because never has a film plodded so slowly the feeling of numbness after the two hours of pure drivel brought back memories of costner s awful wyatt earp all those years ago simply put nothing happens in the film but it takes a long time getting to that nothing this would possibly have been a tad more bearable if the performances were good because the direction sure as heck wasn t however unless you are looking to play a game of spot the worst oirish accent then you re gonna be disappointed between that the game of who has the stupidest beard spot the obvious backstabber clue they are all ginger for some reason and nature in australia including lions it is an experience similar to flicking through hallmark the history channel discovery channel and neighbours whilst suffering a huge hangover yup nature pops up a lot as to fill even more time possibly an attempt to look arty the film keeps showing pointless wildlife shots and once all the native species are shown here s a circus to allow for a camel and a lion which is used during one fight to try to make us actually feel more sorry for the lion than the massacred people this is a turgid emotionless piece of historical fluff which should have gone straight to tv there isn t even one good word i can say about this film even the usually fantastic rush seems embarrassed to be here when one of the characters comments that there is only bullets left for him and his pal i myself was wishing i had a gun to blow any memory of this film out of my head
to be honest this film is another in a series of huge disappointments most of these so called masters of horror films are only horrifying in terms of their sub par effects and laughable story lines aside from ron perlman everyone else in this film cannot act to save their life the gunshots sounded like someone was playing bop it under the boom mike or something and looked completely unrealistic overall this film is about as scary as home alone the only good masters are cigarette burns jennifer and maybe pelts i don t know how these directors can sleep at night knowing that they have ruined the very genre that some of them used to actually understand
this unpleasant film has little to recommend it dolph lundgren gives a performance that is better than either this script or his other action films have allowed and there are occasional snippets of dialog that suggest the film might have been able to provide some insight into a bizarre subculture but no motivations are either murky or trite most of the acting is sub par the script creates needless confusion and the director s needless fascination with focusing on gore is distracting it s hard to imagine who the audience is for this film
beyond dirt cheap this shot on video exercise in ineptitude was difficult to get through it s got the typical gore that you d expect in a zombie movie but none of the required atmosphere to make it worth while what s strange is that this is an amateur german video and the version i saw is english dubbed the dubbers seem to be american fans penpals of the germans who can t decide whether they want to play it straight or turn it into a comedy one character a white german of course is dubbed by a black guy apparently who speaks with thick ebonics kno wahm sayin comrad
my friends usually can put up with a lot of hopeless movies but this one was too poor for us to even watch it to the end it was just so boring and unoriginal not even the hot girls that starred in this movie could keep me watching everything was just predicable and annoying the acting was at times good but more times bad the most annoying character in the whole movie that you just wanted to die would have to be the main characters best friend the more i saw him the more i wanted to smash my screen you know what fat ugly kid i m talking about the plot has been done so many times before i think they should be sued by other movie companies ok it is a good idea but thats all this movie had overall this movie can only be watched if by your self to save any abuse from your friends or if you have absolutely nothing better to do

i admit the problem i have with the much celebrated ealing films i ve seen so far could be mine to my taste either they are black and rippingly funny or so light in tone to be unsatisfying as comedies or stories that s a self important way of saying i wanted to like the man in the white suit but found myself struggling to sit through its short run time textile worker sidney stratton alec guinness may be meek in manner but he is doggedly committed to progress in the form of his attempts to invent a strand of fabric that can t be broken or made dirty using a factory lab for his latest experiment he toils against limitations both material and human the latter being the benighted mill bosses who don t understand what he is up to then figure it out and become even more committed to stopping him it s small minds like yours that stand in the way of progress sidney complains practicing in the mirror what he struggles to say to the man one problem with man in the white suit is that sidney s vision of progress is awfully small minded too more so even than that of the bosses or the laborers who also resent his work my problem is more elemental for a comedy white suit is not funny it s a rather earnest script which too often tries to mine its feeble attempts at humor from spit takes double takes triple takes and dizzy takes the best joke is the sound of the machine sidney toils at going bleep blop bleep bop endlessly and fetching queer looks from every visitor until sidney either extracts his miracle from it or blows it up trying like every other bit of stray humor that functions decently in this film it s leaned on too long i ve never seen guinness less affecting in a movie even though he looks impossibly young and earnest though actually in his mid s he seems so bloodless even more so than the wax faced general he played in doctor zhivago he s the same cold fish whether he s ignoring the sad affections of the affecting mill girl who offers to give him her life savings when he loses his job pan faced vida hope as bertha or the more sultry charms of young daphne birnley joan greenwood his one real ally in his fight against shabbiness and dirt as she puts it making those words sound as impossibly sexy as only greenwood could supporting players make white suit work as well as it does ernest thesinger of bride of frankenstein fame plays a singularly nasty captain of industry who looks like nosferatu and makes a laugh like a death rattle howard marion crawford as another factory leader is as memorable here as he was playing a blinkered medical officer in lawrence of arabia then there s the undeniable charm of mandy miller as a little girl who steals her few moments on camera right from under everyone else but most of the scenes are played so straight that one wouldn t think director alexander mackendrick had ever worked on a comedy before his previous ealing comedy whisky galore doesn t reverse that impression alas roger macdougall s play posits the notion of scientific progress as potential disaster but fails to present dull sidney in anything other than the most blandly pleasant of lights ealing comedies are remembered for capturing the human side of comedy yet the ealings i ve seen never seem to do this working only when they play aggressively against our own sympathies kind hearts and coronets and the ladykillers mackendrick again go figure are classics this way white suit on the other hand is a pointless ramble that falls apart when it should cohere just like that unfortunate suit
note i will reveal a key part of the plot but if you ve looked at the dvd cover or any promotional material you ll already know it this movie seems to have been written by an eleven year old who isn t very bright and was probably very tired when he wrote it the writer doesn t know the difference between a chemical and an organism forget the fact the the un and the nsa seem to be running the show in hungary forget the fact that when these master intelligence agents go chasing after someone whose mere touch will kill you in about a minute they don t wear protective gear not even gloves these are quibbles in the context of this movie in the scientific world within this story and gravity goes sideways the fact is that the people in this movie do not with a few exceptions behave the way human beings behave almost every time a character responds to something it is inappropriate the love story of course there is one makes soap opera scripts seem like shakespeare i can t believe we wasted a free movie rental on this thing
a scientist on an island is in deep sorrow about the loss of his son who died of kidney cancer so he thinks why not turn my dead son into a hammerhead shark well who wouldn t it s a little hard to cope with the fact that the hammerhead shark that s killing everybody is constantly being called paul also william forsythe s cast as a macgyver kick ass savingtheday kinda hero lacks credibility on the other hand there are a few hot chicks who make you actually look at the screen while shark paul bites another one to death as a matter of fact i find bad b movies quite amusing but for my taste it would have been a much better movie if it was made for say bucks less then it might have been fun
well my goodness am i disappointed when i first heard news of a remake of robert wise s film the haunting i had a fear that it would be ruined by an abundance of summer movie sized visual effects but deep down i had faith surely with such a talented cast intact de bont and company will not ruin a film who s original was a fantastic and frightening movie that understood the delicate art of subtlety well subtlety where are you now my fears have manifested a promising movie has gone wrong yes eugenio zannetti s production design is jaw dropping the movie is wonderfully photographed and composer jerry goldsmith can never ever do wrong but the script puts it s fine actors to the test asking them to deliver the kind of stilted dialogue that is only spoken in movies in the end the always wonderful lili taylor is the only performer to escape with some dignity and that s just barely but the crime of all crimes is that the horror is shown to us we can no longer use our imaginations feel that horrible dread of fear of the unknown no we get some visual effects to show us what we re supposed to be afraid of and you know what as wonderfully realized as they are the visual effects come off as sort of silly and the climax is a phantasmogoric mess but things had gone terribly wrong long before that everything in the haunting is overdone and overblown i m afraid there are no real thrills or creaks in this old haunted house monstrosity only groans check out the original instead
well what can one say firstly this adaptation is far too long at hours for the complexity or lack of such of the plot the actors try really hard to make something of this film but there is too little content for the time available swayzee is really not a quatermain character at all after seeing sean connery s interpretation of the great man in the league of extraordinary gentlemen swayzee really does not make the grade this chap with the winchester repeating rifle has none of the strength stature subtlety or humour needed for the part and is upstaged by everyone including the witch doctor who incidentally seems from my point of view to be more convincing as an actor than the rest of the cast some of the vistas are pleasing but there are silly mistakes in the cinematography for example when the happy team arrive at the water hole in the middle of the desert their tracks are visible down to the oasis just waiting for them to walk in them climbing out of the mine leads to an exit on the next shot nothing like the exit seen from the passage they have climbed through et cetera i was waiting for doug mcclure to appear at any moment in some ways i wish he had the leader of the russians pursuing quatermain is a shoddily created stereotypical character who just shoots at everything swayzee does quite well as the sad father returned to london who is unable to obtain the custody of his son swayzee should stick to that sort of thing he is not able to carry the part of a courageous gentleman with a stout heart experience of life and sense of fair play out of barely
drawing restraint dir matthew barney how do you know when you re in the middle of a pretentious art film is it that there is only lines of dialogue in minutes of film is it when bjork is wearing what looks like a giant furry pita on her head in a pseudo asian ritual maybe when mammoth turds and spinal columns are used in a whale blubber experiment or when you re about ready to kill the composer for making a minimal and still annoying version of a philip glass score in any case drawing restraint is among the most pretentious of the modern art movies at minutes it adds to its pretension by being boring to boot i would call the use of color stunning and the opening sequence interesting but the rest of the movie looked like it was filmed for a discovery channel documentary that is until it looks like they were trying to film their version of p ss christ but that will be coming up later actually the documentary esquire portions were the best parts of it the surface plot is about a whaling ship and then there is a ritual about making whale fat then there are the guests in the form of bjork and matthew barney who are welcomed on the ship by being put through a ritual of humiliation which includes passed out head shaving think frat boy pranks nicotine patches and giant furry pita hats then there is mutual evisceration cannibalism and lets not forget the giant turd matthew barney has written that this is about the relationship between self imposed resistance and creativity that s almost like saying if you don t get it then you re not creative in your interpretation so sod off because i m an artist oh wait that s the post modern interpretation of that sentence and what the movie would be about if it was post modern but its supposed to be modern art which is about the art itself so let s start this whole interpretation bit shall we the following lines are only serious and should not be taken as any realistic attempt to interpret the movie the first half hour concerns pearl divers and the construction of a giant ramp obviously the ramp is symbolic of the need for self elevation to whatever standards you hold dear and the pearl divers are looking for pearls of wisdom then on a whaling ship they build a crate that looks like it is in the crude shape of a whale obviously a crude element of foreshadowing on the ship they make whale fat inside the shape of the whale and take out the fins portion they replace this with a spinal column and later a giant turd these are supposed to be the states of the movie itself when its fat its entertaining but bad for you when it is the spinal column its the important parts of the movie or the backbone so to speak then the giant turd is the bowels of the movie or when the movie is crap bjork and matthew barney the arrive on separate ships are put into strange humiliating outfits which aren t even well made or symmetrical one suspects that they ran out of money and barney was trying to quit smoking so they put patches on his head they go through a ritual and learn about the ship from a japanese wise man who tells them that the ship is scarred from when another ship hit it a crash or intersection if you will this inspires bjork and barney who are different on the outside to start cutting each other s legs off and eat them so they could turn into whales themselves and be the same person they intersect oh did i forget to mention that this has been done in a robbie williams video then the pearl divers come back with their mouths full of pearls of knowledge which they let fall to make a stupid venn diagram barney made it through th grade geometry obviously or maybe at least some social studies oh and did i forget bjork s ear gouging i want to kill her score at times it is hypnotic but at others you just want to assassinate her art film is one thing but when you just throw up all sorts of symbolism in the hopes of getting a reaction out of people it becomes a self destructive joke when do you cross the line between becoming a joke in terms of art dali and bunuel frequently made surreal pieces of nonsense but were more coherent and or entertaining than this piece of trash un chien andalou had the sensibility to cram as much symbolism as it could into less than half an hour so can i recommend this only if you like dull high art films with lots of symbolism and flat imagery d
a film crew is shooting a horror movie in an old supposedly cursed house where over the years seven people have mysteriously died one of the crew finds an old book of spells and it looks like it would be perfect to use in some of the ritual scenes in their movie it is reasoned that the spells in the book are better written than the script they are using but as the book is read the graveyard outside suddenly comes to life now the cast and crew are faced with real danger imdb lists a running time of minutes for the first of those minutes nothing happens far too much time is spent on the movie within a movie are we supposed to be frightened by the horror movie that they are shooting we already know that their movie isn t real these scares just don t work there are very few things to enjoy about the house of seven corpses the acting is atrocious most of these actors would have trouble making a elementary school play the score is terrible it is very reminiscent of a s television series and provides no atmosphere speaking of atmosphere other than a few moments at the end of the movie there is none to speak of character logic is all but non existent even in a movie you expect characters to behave in a certain way here i don t think i remember one scene where a character didn t choose the most illogical avenue available to them and finally there s those first minutes of the movie that i ve already mentioned can you say boring i haven t rated the house of seven corpses any lower because of instances where the movie probably by accident actually works my two favorite are the beginning and ending the opening title sequence presents the deaths of the seven previous owners and may be the highlight of the movie and the ending scenes on the massive staircase as the zombie menaces the film crew are somewhat effective what a ringing endorsement overall though these moments aren t enough to make this a good movie
i believe in keeping religion out of government and out of the movies when i want a sermon i ll go to church but i don t want one from a movie i don t mind some supernatural themes after all religion is about as supernatural as you can get but this movie had so much preaching in it that i was really annoyed the landlady reminded me of witches that of seen in other movies the bad guy even looked like he had horns and what a silly ending the hero went into the meeting and yelled at all of those old men and that broke the spell if only life were that simple i think that when movies are that stupid they ought to be distributed with a warning danger preaching contained herein
my family and i screened underdog the night before and as bad as underdog is my four year old loved it hot rod makes it look like oscar worthy material the only thing that could have saved this movie was if evel himself had come out of retirement to slap samberg in the face for making this movie i will admit however that the soundtrack was good i wasn t sure if the movie was set in the s but with the majority of the music coming from europe who knows if i were you i would take a pass and just stay at home and watch the test pattern on your local tv station or if you are dead set on watching this people under the influence might enjoy it
i can t say i m all that experienced in misty mundae flicks having seen only a handful but it s obvious that this was made on a shoestring and while it might have been respectable that the filmmakers were able to make a tomb raider rip off inside a garage it isn t because it s completely obvious that this is what they were doing the film only runs for forty five minutes and this is definitely a good thing as there isn t nearly enough plot here to stretch it out for any longer it has something to do with an evil nazi scientist who looks about as evil as a porn star playing a nazi scientist ever could a mummy which is clearly a man wrapped up in toilet roll and misty this film s version of tomb raider who keeps her top on for much less time than angelina jolie did in the big budget version i have to say that even in spite of its shortcomings this film could have been better it s got misty mundae for a start and even better than that if you ask me is the fact that it also stars the even hotter darian caine the pair gets to engage in all the lesbian sex that you would expect from a seduction cinema film and this is at the expense of the nonexistent plot although that isn t really a bad thing obviously this is a rubbish film but the fact that it s short is to its credit and if you re after a bit of lesbian sex you could do worse
the actors did a really good job playing their roles particularly the mom however as the movie progressed i found i was watching it more for their acting and not because i cared in the least for the people and at times i felt irritated by the irresponsible and hands off approach to parenting displayed again and again the daughter is a year old shallow skank whose main ambition in life is bedding famous men and becoming a dancing nyphette complete with lots of booty shaking the son is a guy with low self esteem that seems very desperate for a relationship and friends so much that he throws a drug party late in the film the husband and wife are both bored but rather than put energy into their stale relationship would rather seek out new partners though the wife picks poorly as the man she throws herself at happens to be gay oops i just felt that all the characters needed to grow up and had a hard time caring for such shallow jerks i think the author s attempt was to demonstrate the utter banality and hollowness of the capitalist system however given that these characters are not typical of the average western family it seems disingenuous
i think that most everyone wants to believe that extraordinary things exist and this film shows no restraint in trying to exploit that to the fullest the presentation is very interesting well presented and the graphics are state of the art but from a scientific point of view it just doesn t work hydrogen filled flying bladders they would need to be the size of a mack truck to be useful and then there s the ever present possibility of a catastrophic explosion i have no problem with fantasy just don t try to pass it off as fact some folks will always misunderstand all in all the film is entertaining but i constantly found myself saying oh brother what a load of if you want a fake documentary watch this is spinal tap instead or at the very least turn the sound off
phew i don t what to say this is a film that could be really good a with a bunch of stoned viewers some of the acting reminded me of john waters early offerings perhaps i should take that back i don t want to insult waters ability as a director storyteller i particularly loved the lawyer taking about the full faith and credibility clause it s full faith and credit by the way this also reminds me of the conrad boys where the main actor is also the writer director film editor etc those sort of multi involved undertakings such as that are probably best left to very seasoned film professionals who would have the technical ability albeit a stunt some might say to pull something off like that
first i am not really a fan of the whole things eating flesh in disgusting new ways genre of film but i am a bad movie afficionado so my next door neighbor said he had the worst movie ever this one so we start watching it first and foremost it is recorded on a camcorder sans tripod second the voice of the skinny white doctor is dubbed by a large black man third none of the dialogue makes any sense fourth the zombie scenes though unconvincing and chockful of poor makeup and tomato paste lead me to believe the director and my next door neighbor are in need of psychological help it s funny for about minutes but it gets old fast it s so amateurish it s like watching a poorly dubbed high school video yearbook with zombies a note to anyone involved with this movie i want the minutes of my life i spent watching this before i fell asleep back
weak plot unlikely car malfunction and helpless fumbling characters at first i thought this movie was made during the seventies since the picture quality as well as the storyline and drama seemed taken from an old kojac episode when i checked and found that it was really made as late as i was astonished this is by far one of the worst and least thriller movies i have ever seen if you read this be advised if you see it you waste time when you could have done something more exciting like watching paint dry
having seen triumph of the will i can only say this movie is ghastly even measured against the historically low standards of the time naturally it s all totally fabricated and prejudicial this is what one would expect of s german propaganda unfortunately the quality of the presentation itself is hackneyed and cheap it s also so blatantly ridiculous that even contemporary germans must ve left the theater holding their noses in a genre renowned for its base appeal lack of originality and unapologetic wrong headedness this film doesn t even qualify as bad it would have to improve significantly to attain that status
after highlander which i am still in denial about i thought is was impossible to make a sequel that could make me cry because it was so bad i was wrong i loved the original wargames however this movie is inaccurate with computer details and details about the original movie the original wargames at least had some hacks that worked whoever wrote this movie knew nothing about computers except how to use a word processor i doubt he or she even watched the original movie the acting isn t even convincing please save yourselves under no circumstances watch this movie i don t care if the channel is stuck on the tv and you can t turn the tv off this movie will ruin your life
this is not an all around terrible comedy but it is very dull it has barely any laughs and it wastes its lavish production values there is one poignant moment near the end when fu manchu offers a dose of his elixir to his nemesis and tells him that you ve been my one worthy adversary and now we can start all over again that scene however along with burt kwouk s amusing cameo in the beginning are the only memorable parts of the movie
there s no getting around it this movie is terrible i ve seen the old christopher lee fu manchu movies i m familiar with the characters and it s serial origins but it s still just godawful however peter sellers genius still shines through with his portrayal of nayland smith with echoes of sadness tragedy and strength simmering through a stoic facade it s a performance i place on par with peter cushing s portrayal of van helsing but done in a tenth of the cumulative screen time of all cushing s dracula movies if the movie was done in a more serio comic vein like bubba ho tep by way of the s avengers tv show this could ve been something special if you re a fu manchu or peter sellers completest this is something you need to see but it s a pass for anyone else
this film was absolutely ugh i can t find the word oh wait crap i mean when it started i was like yeah this looks good and then after it was so boring i nearly fell asleep and it had nothing to do with the fact that i caught a late showing because it was utter filth ram gopal varma has tried his best but the cast could never live up to the cast of the original sholay i mean what was he thinking doing a remake what was he trying to do be like sanjay leeli bhansani and win all the awards next year like he did for black ajay and that other guy were good especially the other guy who played raj because out of all of them he was the one to look at what was amitabh doing he s destroying his own dignity by doing all these stupid films first nishabd then cheeni kum then jhoom barabar jhoom and now this i mean hes got to gather a bit of his money and move as far away from bollywood as possible before he loses all his respect and i m telling you he s already past half his way i mean all this is really good for the other actors like shah rukh khan who s getting a really good name now because of the recent downfall of amitabh i never really liked him because he thinks he s god and i just knew abhishek was going to be in that movie if you want to save your and spend it on something good go watch heyy babyy because that s just the funniest movie ever and it s number one in the charts
follows the same path as most sequels first one was great second was average and this one full of bad acting and some stupid dialog and well as a lot of suspension of disbelief this movie was weak too predictable and i just couldn t stand that henry wrinkler like boss with that stupid eye there was so much more they could have done with this i liked the first one a lot i wish they would have went more down those lines rather than what they did here there was too much unexplained that needed to be explained what time period this was in and why why why is there an old fashioned phone in that room i understand there is another one in the works blah
i have always wanted to see this because i love cheesy horror movies and with a title like this i was sure the incredible melting man would be a lot of fun it really wasn t i mean the acting was entertainingly bad the script contained some classic bad lines and the special effects looked like someone had sneezed all over the lead actor so i should have loved it unfortunately it s really draggy between these highlights i decided to watch the last half of the movie while doing my tax return that s how boring this film is nevertheless if you love bad movies you will enjoy the dramatic exit of the fat nurse and the stellar acting of the guy who plays dr ted to be fair to the poor man he does have to deliver some amazingly inept lines with straight face like the conversation he has with his wife on tracking down the i m man i ll find him with a geiger counter is he radioactive just a little bit yes the plot has dr ted wandering about trying to find a superstrong zombie killing machine armed only with what looks like a mini dyson he s a brave man unfortunately his plan fails when he finds a big lot of goop on a tree oh god it s his ear says dr ted to the audience i m so glad he cleared that up i realise i m making this movie sound rather fun it would be if it were only minutes long but unfortunately it goes on and on and the incredible melting dude just dangles about making a sticky mess when he should be eating more people in my opinion i think if you were truly stoned you would probably love it just don t have pop tarts during the movie because the lead actor really does resemble one near the end
this movie tackles child abduction from the point of view of a mom lisa hartman black who acts like a man would in an action thriller unlike other movies where the focus is on the police here the mom is tracking down her ex husband who kidnapped their son she gets help from her lawyer who eventually falls in love with her before finally catching up with her son a lot of bizarre things happen the mom tries to take a child that looks like her son from a local children s play at a community theater she gets caught and then realizes it is not her child that alone would have gotten most people put into the mental ward or a few months in jail waiting for trial however in this movie the mom is release after a couple of hours because the victim s parents feel sorry for her a little while later mom breaks into her mother in law s house and then the police arrive and they have their guns aimed at her but they let her run away because they recognize her and feel sorry for her at another point in the story they have found the child but when the police arrive to search the house it turns out they left out the back door and got into the river on a dinghy that apparently the dad kept around just for such an emergency escape the mom gets someone to lend her a raft and even though it must have taken some time in a real world she and the lawyer boyfriend and the police catch up to the other raft pretty fast and it is upside down in the water by landfall instead of getting out of the raft to search for the dad on the land mom presumes he drowned the boy and she jumps into the water when she sees his life jacket of course she cannot swim and sinks like a rock the lawyer saves her but they miss a chance to run after the dad at one point the mom is told her son died at a clinic in mexico on and on it goes and where it stops nobody knows in some ways this movie really exploits child abduction and it is not very positive on the other hand seeing a woman do all the crazy things that men do in these kind of movies was fun or funny
how this film was made with so many big stars is beyond me this is a terrible clich ridden film with the worst acting any of these actors have ever done it really surprises me that so many of these a list stars would agree to this unfunny film what s even worse is the fact that is made almost million here in the states it does go to show however that big stars can pull in the bucks even if the film is terrible i felt sorry for everyone involved in this snore fest billy crystal tried his best with the what he was given and the rest of the stars seemed to be walking through the motions whatever you do don t fall for the excellent cast because no one could have saved this
this is not a good film the acting is remarkably stiff and unconvincing the film doesn t seem to know whether it is going for a real horror approach or to go down the camp and kitsch route i never saw the first film but this one doesn t stand up on its own merits there are several unconvincing plot twists and the viewer is never made aware of the importance of the lead female vampire not worth the effort of watching
terrible film made on a budget of about very obvious miniature sets used poor acting and an awful storyline concerning aliens who use discarded meat from a butcher shop as fuel for their spaceship the film contains some blood not enough to disturb and a character with an eggbeater replacing one of his hands yes you read that correctly one saving grace was a song performed at the talent show how s that for irony by a punk new wave band that i think was called i m a heat seeking missile other than that this is not worth your time not even on a so bad it s good level watch if you are into cheesy alien films but anyone else should steer clear rating out of
sitting down to watch the th season of the bachelor on the wings of love i knew i would be in for an interesting time i had watched some of the previous seasons of the bachelor in passing watching an episode or two and missing the next three or so i find that the bachelor is often appealing and intriguing though its quality and morality are often lacking on the wings of love details the journey taken by jake a year old commercial pilot from dallas texas to find true love as true a love as one can find in a season long reality drama dating show jake meets beautiful girls from all over the country he begins to get to know them a bit but it is mostly superficial how well can you get to know someone in a few minute conversations jake tries to make his true intentions known from the very beginning at least to the audience he noted that he doesn t just want love or a good time but he wants a fianc or wife we can only assume that he has made this clear to the women in the competition as well if that is the case it might explain to a degree some of the women s actions the women are super competitive while they don t even know jake at all yet they are still in it to win it no matter what the cost not only were the women competitive but they were also confident and catty threats backstabbing and warnings of watch out all show that these women weren t there for a good time either jake noted that he was not just looking for sex appeal but looking for a connection however the girls pulled out all the stops to try to impress jake with said sex appeal they arrived at the mansion in skimpy dresses either low cut or short while some girls seemed to maintain their sense of decorum others missed that memo altogether one girl channy noted that jake was a good guy to whom she could be a naughty girl she went on to say that jake could land on her runway anytime she got flack from the other girls for her provocative statement which showed their take on these situations so a reality dating show couldn t be that bad could it besides the obvious issue of sex driven attraction there are other issues that mar this seemingly harmless show is this the right way to find a future mate vying for someone s attention by flaunting oneself to extreme proportions unfortunately however that is what america has reduced dating to these days pleasure and sex without commitment and a little happiness on the side another problem is the premature emotional attachment by which many of the girls bound themselves to jake a few girls in particular seemed to be overly attached one girl said if i don t get that first impression rose it will kill me as mentioned before they don t even know him yet and she was talking about a specific rose not just one of the roses to keep from being eliminated michelle in particular seemed to have some issues with attachment to jake the other girls noticed it too after one particular michelle outburst vienna asserted that michelle had a mental breakdown and we ve only been here an hour michelle got the last rose of the evening on the first show narrowly missing elimination and was extremely emotional about it the other girls thought it was simply ridiculous another girl also cried but because she was eliminated it began with survivor and from there it just took off reality tv it shows our entertainment interests as a country if we weren t watching the shows and giving them good ratings the networks would not continue to run them the only logical conclusion that can be drawn is that enough of america is hooked one thing is clear america in general loves reality tv and its ensuing trappings this begs me to question why is it that we even like reality tv what is it about it that draws us to it is it because we see the similarities to our own lives or is it because we want to be sure that we are more stable and less pathetic than others whatever it is that draws us to it we should be careful of the media and entertainment that we allow to fill our minds i m not saying that all reality tv shows are bad however i am saying that we need to evaluate each one episodes used for critique season premier and episode
i don t remember the last time i reacted to a performance as emotionally as i did to justin timberlake s in edison i got so emotional i wanted to scream in anguish destroy the screen readily accept the hopeless cries of nihilism timberlake is horribly miscast in fact casting him is like casting andy dick to play the lead role in patton or nathan lane to play jesus but that is almost beside the point timberlake is simply a bad actor and he would be equally terrible in any role i used to have problems with ben affleck s acting talent but timberlake makes affleck look like sir ian mckellen or dame judi dench with his metrosexual lisp read lithp his boyish glances and emotional expressions which derive from something like the clich expressions for actors he poisons the screen upon which he is inflicted mercilessly and no matter how you slice it i do not and will not buy his role as an amateur turned crusader for justice journalist it simply will not fly however timberlake alone isn t to blame for his failure director david j burke puts him not only in the essentially primary role but also places him aside morgan freeman kevin spacey john heard dylan mcdermott cary elwes and i m surprised he was as good ll cool j i can imagine one almost physically suffering watching some of this cast interact with timberlake there is an upside to this of course the moment any of these actors interact without justin there it feels like a double relief a pleasure if you will freeman and spacey may not have more than minutes of screen time alone together but that ten minutes is blissful in contrast to their scenes with our so called hero dylan mcdermott is also a breath of fresh air but enough of timberlake bashing words aren t enough in this particular case to do the trick edison is a very very run of the mill corruption story it s plot ranges from clich to simply preposterous i do however admire the motivation behind making it which i interpret as an homage to films like serpico or donnie brasco or maybe even chinatown don t get me wrong edison is not even in the same ballpark as these films but i can stretch my suspension of disbelief to admire its reason for existence perhaps to justify my sitting through it the script in and of itself features some surprisingly bad writing yes it has some decent interchanges but any conversation between piper perabo who is wasted here and timberlake seems like it was lifted straight out of a dawson s creek episode it s your typical far too glib for reality let s impress the audience with how well we articulate and fail dialogue this dialogue mind you is punctuated by great music at the wrong moments sometimes it feels like edison wants to morph into a music video where the emotion of the scene is not communicated through acting but precisely through the badly chosen music and variant film speeds read slow motion thinking about it edison is a curiosity it s sure as hell got a cast to kill for but the performances are marred by timberlake who simply doesn t work in film as in most art if one thing is off the whole thing feels off directors must make tough choices david j burke missed the mark here some of the scenes play well in and of themselves but as a whole they don t seem to fit like puzzle pieces from different puzzles forced into one incoherent picture and it s not particularly an exciting puzzle to begin with
dalmatians dir kevin lima believed to be cured cruella de vil close is released from prison and sets out to make a new start in life things are going well for cruella who is busy helping homeless dogs off the street when the clock strikes on big ben things turn bad the hypnotic cure is reversed and cruella is back and this time she is determined to make that spotted coat she always wanted glenn close reprises her role as cruella de vil and once again is the highlight of the film every scene with her in is worth watching in this dull sequel which feels more of a repeat of the previous film rather than a new story she s changed ken sheperd ioan gruffudd
the spoilers in this review are offered as a public service because the only way to enjoy this costume melodrama is to know that our protagonist the lady barbara skelton gets raped and gunned down in the end and not a moment too soon i d have shot the screen myself but i was afraid i d hit james mason the original novel called the life and death of the wicked lady skelton i guess people didn t whine about spoilers back then was written by a woman an english navy brat who was either troubled or cynical or both her heroine is devastatingly beautiful and the author seems to think that if you have beauty nothing else matters but other things do matter such as the fact that lady barbara s immediate and only response when someone gets in her way is homicide she murders three men in five attempts a serial femme fatale she s got a case of dissocial personality disorder that should have landed her in either bedlam or newgate lockwood plays her as a narcissistic vamp wearing so much makeup that i thought of her as a restoration era joan rivers or a restoration era joan rivers ha yet lady b is irresistible to all three principal male characters michael rennie james mason and griffith jones all of whom do good work as does patricia roc of course all three admirers realize in short order what a psychotic bitch barbara is but the plot keeps them all in her orbit until one of them finally does gun her down accidentally in what is meant to be either irony or just desserts given the dramatic death scene with a boom lifting the camera out through the windows and heavenward i presume we re meant to give a damn about her death but hers is the first corpse we don t care about
first off there s absolutely no flirting going on in this film with anthony or anyone else these people don t flirt they just do it your first test of endurance is to wade through more than minutes of intense violence and sexual perversion this wouldn t be so bad hell i like violence and perversion as much as the next reviewer but without a context to put it in it is repellent so you make it through the torture and mayhem then we meet donna and the movie turns into something all together different not better just different a road picture without heart there are lame attempts at comedy thanks to cameos broadly written and broadly played by broads like judy tenuta and mink stole and a few hookers and drag queens too they all deserve better the photography is purposely disorienting so if you get motion sickness or really any kind of sickness this flick is not for you come to think of it i m not sure just who this flick is for except maybe gay and bi sexual s m fans who like poorly scripted poorly shot indy films about themselves
wow this was a very bad movie as read in other comments this movie has no plot no character development they possibly had some kind of script but it s difficult to tell based on the actual end result the editing of this movie was really non existent it tends to jump from scene to scene without any connection or anything to assist the viewer in determining what is actually happening all in all this is simply a low budget zombie flick that was not thought out at all has bad acting bad dialogue bad everything the only thing that saves this movie from a or is the gore factor i think this must be where they spent whatever money they had to try to justify making this unless you are like me dedicated to finding and watching all the zombie flicks you can find do not watch this period
i sat down to watch this movie with my friends with very low expectations my expectations were no where near low enough i honestly could not tell what genre this movie was from watching it and if it was a comedy the humor was completely missed the plot was nonexistent and the acting was horrendous my friends and i managed to watch approximately to minutes of this film before we turned it off and promptly begged the video store to take it back i do not recommend this movie to anyone unless you are purposely trying to watch the worst movies of all time i honestly don t know how this film lasted more than a day in theatres and moreover i can not understand why anyone would willing watch it considering not only it s very uninteresting title but also the lack of any famous actors actresses in it s cast this review is not a joke and i honestly think this could possibly be the worst movie ever made it s certainly the worst movie i ve ever had to sit through
how the hell did they get this made presenting itself as a caper comedy the misbegotten is essentially two hours of people mumbling sentence fragments the usually dependable warren beatty looks drunk and the usually hilarious goldie hawn acts like she s on depressants as for gert frobe his most famous role goldfinger was infinitely more admirable than his character here not even the guy with the champagne bottle of lsd can save this litany of worthlessness am i comparing this movie to plan from outer space i wouldn t do such a thing even if someone paid me p fos was idiotically made but ended up hilarious this was idiotically made and causes you to feel like your brain just melted out of your ears warren beatty and goldie hawn made up for this when they co starred in shampoo but then they co starred in the dreadful town country maybe they just shouldn t co star in movies all in all i would rather have my skin torn off than have to watch this again awful maybe they should remake it with jackie chan then i would pay to see it
what happened in the making of this movie so that it ended up as the total mess it is just one year after the breakfast club a brilliant movie with many of the same actors as in st elmo s fire who by the way looked and acted in the latter more like they were still the high school misfits from the former but without the grip or discipline in portraying their roles was it the directing or the writing since it was the same person joel schumacher it must be both but then schumacher has since given us the phantom of the opera phone booth a time to kill and two batman movies batman and robin and batman forever which range from good to great directing something went wrong on stef because it has no genius whatsoever no comedy worth anything and is very far off the mark on what is truly valuable in life example the character wendy a rich little girl with a heart to do good and help the less fortunate played by mare winningham reveals to billy an unruly slob who cheats on his wife and on his girlfriends drinks far too much and has no sense of order in his life appropriately played by rob lowe that she is still a virgin billy truly see a challenge and possible conquest but wendy is not ready wendy in fact is so not ready it is hard to believe she is in this clique of friends later in the story when billy whose wife has left him taken his child and married another has somehow drawn some of the strings of his life together billy is leaving for new york deserting and abandoning all parental responsibility for his baby daughter he convinces wendy that her virginity would be the perfect going away gift from her to him and wendy who works as a social worker helping broken families seems not to be phased at all by this despot give me a break the one thing she can only give once she gives to a loser who is leaving his family and friends schumacher frames this scene as a wonderful and touching moment many more example exist where there is a complete disconnect between what is real and of value being tossed overboard and the acts are made to look like virtue i suppose some may say that that was the s but i remember it was in the s that men began to be held responsible for the children they fathered whether in a marriage or out i think this movie is so bad because it is so out of sync with what it really valuable and right as for the technique not the story it was terrible as well it is disjointed and feels like a hour movie that has been edited to hour and minutes transitions and jumps in time simply do not make sense pick up what is on the editing room floor put it back in and the movie would probably flow much better but it still is a horrible movie maybe schumacher has become a better and stronger director since he must have or maybe he was over his head when it came to writing the screenplay for st elmo s fire or maybe this group of actors took over the set and went their own way that is what i really think happened
i couldn t believe some of the horrible dialog coming out of people s mouths and the end reel of bloopers attached to body of the film was a real hoot and we get titty shots of angelique pettyjohn sort of and loren crabtree to boot a teleportation device activated by psychic angelique pettyjohn brings an alien container to an underground lab out in the desert according to director fred olen ray they were leftover sets from the klaus kinski film android which gives the film an increased value beyond how cheap it looks inside the container is a midget alien played by ray s son who starts clawing people to death it was pretty funny watching this little creature in a black reptile suit with what looks like large beetle shells attached to it running around in the dark we even get to see the little thing stamp and tear at a poster of et which i thought was hilarious and then there s what looks like a snake that also comes out of the container that gets hammered to death by william fair after the mini creature chews into frank mcdonald s neck in the kitchen a low budget take on alien i suppose the whole thing ends abruptly looking like they ran out of film at the end before the blooper reel comes in with the end credits talk about a lack of funding fred olen ray also mentions in the director s commentary that they also weren t sure if aldo ray would make through the shooting and remember his lines he barely did low budget cheese sneeze it s fun to watch i ll grant ya that out of
one of the silliest movies of the s an unbearable haunted house comedy with music starring kay kyser kyer orchestra leader and radio star and eternal college fraternity goof off was sort of the precursor to spike jones hamming it up for his guests and backed up willingly by his merry troupe of musicians he s hired to play a birthday party in a gloomy mansion the kind where poison darts imported from africa are framed and hung on the wall the shindig is beset with a creepy judge a scary professor an ominous swami lots of giggly females and enough bad jokes to fill three bob hope pictures the songs by jimmy mchugh and johnny mercer are nothing to brag out and neither is over confident kyser yukking it up with elbow in the ribs material that turns back ten years from
jerry spies tom listening to a creepy story on the radio and seizes the opportunity to scare his nemesis i didn t find this particular episode that funny the humour seemed rather constrained and the whole set up was kinda lame jerry is essentially the bad guy in this one tormenting poor tom for no particular reason there is the occasional flash of inspiration such as tom s literal heart in mouth experience and the moment when his nines lives are sucked out of his body but on the whole this effort lacks the frenetic pacing excellent animation and sheer wit of most of t j s other cartoons
this movie was a disappointment i was looking forward to seeing a good movie i am the type of person who starts a movie and doesn t turn it off until the end but i was forcing myself not to turn it off theonly reason why i didn t turn it off was because i am a huge christian slater fan and i wanted to see him act in it i was really speechless after i finished watching the movie this movie was one of the worst movies that i have seen in my life thank you christian slater for putting some humor into it if you hadn t been in this movie i would of been bored out of my mind i also agree that anthony hopkins needs to stick to acting by the time the movie was over i didn t even get the plot i was both confused and annoyed
contains spoiler from both original and movie versions i am a huge fan of notre dame de paris musical i also read book this summer and i watched movie today in the beginning i was hopeful to watch a good film especially when i saw imdb point first scenes were good but i actually waited for theaters scene directly from book but it was normal but when esmeralda kisses gringoire i felt something is wrong they don t even kiss in book even in musical and there were huge gap why esmeralda being judged by sorcerer in the book she teaches her goat how to respond numbers of clock or write word phoebus wait there were a phoebus weren t there in this movie he is some soldier junk nothing more the creators made quasimodo s love to show around and they even canceled frollo s love but notre dame was frollo his thoughts his struggles between love of god and love of human in movie we cant find anything like that all we have is some villain who is really bad and kills people whose clashes with his thoughts and not mentioning phoebus not mentioning love of frollo not mentioning jehan brother of frollo not mentioning mother of esmeralda maybe it is ok the storyline would have chopped much they even not mentioned the real story another ps frollo wasn t a opus dei or some cult member he actually in interest with alchemy he tries to make gold he was stuck in science and religion finally don t watch this movie it is some kind of directors edition to real masterpiece and if you have watched it before read the book god have mercy on you you must read to book immediately this movie is worse than hunchback of notre dame ii the animated movie spend your time with watching notre dame de paris musical enough said
a note to all of you budding film writers study this film if your dialog reads like the dialog in this film please shred your script and try again i didn t have high expectations but was intrigued by the description indicating there was a mystery at the christmas ornament factory the mystery is resolved very early and the film becomes a straight romance i almost stopped watching it at minutes minutes and at the first break my spouse who is the hallmark lifetime fan gave up at the first break forest river is a company town the main business is aikens ornaments who make all manner of holiday decorations the patriarch of the company has recently passed away so the companies future might be in question we soon meet noelle who would rather be on wall street than main street and the mysterious justin who gets a date with noelle after a large snowman she is inflating crashes into justins car once we meet alison aikens doing due diligence for the board we have our story setup if you can t nail all the story arcs by the first commercial break you haven t seen enough of this kind of holiday film maybe that s a good thing
this movie is nothing but a religious tract promoting classic hinduism and new age occultism dressed up with western images to be swallowed by those who are ignorant of foundational religious comparisons basic tenants of hinduism contain elements of reincarnation some of the characters appear both in the present time and also in the s obviously reincarnated god is an impersonal force animal life and plant life are all the same this is pantheism redfield has tried to mix eastern mysticism with western christianty his attempt at syncretism may fool or confuse those who are not seekers of truth but this movie is a feeble excuse for any ultimate reality as the ad in the old berkeley barb used to say for will show you how to start your own religion as one famous prophet has said use the force luke
when i was i saw the documentary a funny thing happened on the way to the moon i actually liked and believed in it for a couple of years but then i grew up and began to think and when i had sought more information this is more info from reel sources and non biased sources when i started at university not so long ago i asked an assistant professor in astronomy about these conspiracy theories what he said shocked me he said that all those theories where lies that baffled me i did not believe it first but then he presented evidence for his claims he quickly debunked most of the theories about the subject humans did not go to the moon the most outrages claim was that the apollo craft could not travel through the van allen radiation belt without the crew perishing from radiation the truth is that the americans use a secret aluminum anti radiation alloy it is not that well known and the exact specifications are a secret and why is it a secret well why should they reveal it back then if they where in a space race with the russians then it would be very dumb to reveal that they had new technology that could shield crew against radiation and then there is the biggest evidence of all the moon stones when the apollo missions did go to the moon they brought back many rocks from the moon to give to geologists and similar scientists who are documenting all things about the moon these rocks and stones are in fact from the moon because the internal basic elements which all matter consist of are also made of special isotopes that are different from quarry to quarry land to land and especially planet from planet the isotopes of these rocks and stones have been proved that they do not come from earth the astronauts brought home hundreds of kilogram s of these rocks all of them have been proved to have come from outside earth and from the same planet ergo the moon landings where not fake nasa did go to another planet the moon though it is not a planet but a satellite to a planet a moon duuh these rocks have been distributed to laboratories and universities all around the world it has been proved humans did go to the moon it is a fact pronto but i do not worry most conspiracy theorists are generally unemployed and uneducated that is mostly why they do not know or lie about these facts the fact remains humans did walk on the moon
this stalk and slash turkey manages to bring nothing new to an increasingly stale genre a masked killer stalks young pert girls and slaughters them in a variety of gruesome ways none of which are particularly inventive it s not scary it s not clever and it s not funny so what was the point of it
there was nothing about this movie that i liked it was so obviously low budget with bad lighting and camera work almost like blair witch project only it wasn t supposed to be that way there wasn t really much to the plot and the movie just drug on and on i actually fast forwarded through the last of the movies but that did not help matters much it looked like it might be good from the box but i must say again nothing about this movie even resembled good no good actors the special effects were so fake the camera work was horrible and the dialogue was painfully terrible on my own personal scale i give this movie a of yikes
i was lured to see this movie by its starpower but ultimately that s all it delivers it plays much more like a greek tragedy than a modern thriller about big city corruption it s greatest flaw is its predictibability and utter lack of suspense we know who the bad guys are from the beginning and just follow along as they fall like dominoes the film to its credit does abstain from gratuitous violence and sex but has forgotten to substitute good clean romance or excitement in any other way all the flavor of a good flat decaffeinated diet cola q a which also takes place in new york is a far better alternative as is la confidential
i know a few things that are worst a few it had a couple of funny scenes it is a movie not appropriate for kids but only a child would find this movie hilarious this is definetly a movie that you would like to use a free rental coupon for don t waste your money just to laugh a couple of times
i saw it i agree with him but i didn t care for his delivery he just came off as an asshole in a poorly edited contrived juvenile smear campaign edit cuts galore etc the camera would be focused on him and you d see or edit cuts just over the course of a minute or two of dialog add in the constant boom mikes in the camera shot which is a film no no this documentary hits a topic with so many angles so many interesting stories that the movie is just so easily done picking on religious fanatics is like picking on the retarded kid it is so easy it is just wrong i mean how hard is it to make these people look like nut bags to make them contradict themselves you just let them recite more then a verse or two i do like when he jumped back in forth between people of the same religion and showed them completely contradicting themselves i just think he could have done something a little more creative the part with the neurologist talking about brain activity was never fleshed out it could have been interesting to show brain scans of people during religious fits compared to drugs or sex or he could have played more on the women all rejoicing over the passion play that looked more like a snuff scene in a new rob zombie movie more could have gone into the history of john smith the mormon founder who had quite the colorful past delve into science v s religion one is a very methodical very strict process for increasing the confidence in theories it builds on itself from a solid bottom up a new layer on top of a more proved layer an enormous burden of proof is required each step of the way the other starts at the top and comes down with unchallengeable claims it is so because well i said so done right i d say turn it into an hbo original series hit a different religion every week it was an eye opener about one thing i must have been blind good ole g w bush no wonder he got elected he had the religious majority and well now that is the blind leading the blind bill moyer well what can i expect from a guy who hands out at sutra in newport beach
i m not sure why spike lee made this train wreck of a movie and conned poor stevie wonder into eternally pairing his beautiful music with this theatrical mess i also resent the way he uses profanity as a part of the normal prose of professional blacks the abuse of his hold on ethnic movie goers is a shame scenes which seem to be contrived out the blue and have nothing to do with the theme or sub themes play as if some college kid wrote this i especially detest the ludicrous scene where the two leads are playfully sparring for no reason at all and the cops come and rough up snipes the overacting of the leads makes one feel as if spike has no respect for his viewers or he has no clue what a movie is all about the final scene appears to be thrown in to justify the use of a sledge hammer to tack a point in this movie also supports the myth that all people of culture use the f word in casual conversation i am hoping he will realize that the rest of his movies are in the same pool as this one where he is not growing as a film maker i think his union with scorcesee in clockers was a wise move he should stick to making documentaries like the four little colored girls shock movies do not an oscar make
i don t know maybe it s because i m brazilian but all that stuff was too much too much love for the music too much parties too much contrast between the nice lives of the main characters come on it s not so sad and the aspect of the city shown by the director everything looks too fake to me the families the relationships the music the happiness it simply sells a little taste of fake latinamerican culture i must be honest it did seduce me a little but who would not be seduced by that fake lives made of nice music sex and parties i m not that stupid what kind of world is this one in which people do not suffer of diarrhea profound sadness and stds i liked the scene with caridad s mother phone call and the discussion about the contract with all the musicians and the spanish people
the great ecstasy of robert carmichael is bad film in every way the script the dreary pace the lack of depth in any character the pointless sub plots the dreadful acting the needless climax all make this possibly the worst film i ve ever seen i found nothing likable enjoyable or intellectually stimulating in any way i imagine the film makers thought they were making something clever and dark with its moody lighting long protracted silences and vaguely haunting classical soundtrack if so they failed utterly it just bored me and i wish i had never watched it avoid at all costs
that jamie foxx would ever deliver such a wonderful oscar winning performance one of the reasons why i was so impressed with foxx s performance in ray was because from watching his hammy obnoxious acting in movies like bait and booty call i would never imagine he would ever hold the oscar if people told me five years ago that jamie foxx was one day going to win an oscar i would laugh right in their faces who knows maybe he s better off sticking to drama because if you watch bait it s clearly evident that comedy is not his forte i swear jamie mugs so much in this movie that i m surprised his face didn t fall off and why does he have to do those stupid voices at every chance he gets anyone familiar with comedians like bob newhart and steven wright knows that doing comedy doesn t require being loud and obnoxious if a joke is funny it s funny if it s not funny then doing some crazy accent is not going to make it any funnier the problem i have with some comedians who decide to try acting is that they favor getting laughs over being in character in real life normal people don t always have witty comebacks and quips like albert brooks said in an interview discussing his character in taxi driver it s important to be funny as your character rather than be funny as a comedian a prime example of jamie violating that rule is the nauseatingly awful scene where his mug shots are being taken and he starts posing for the photographs like a model if a regular person were being thrown in jail would he really be acting goofy while having his mug shots taken and wouldn t the police try to scold him if he was there are many scenes like that throughout the film another awful sequence is one where jamie is on the unwittingly on the phone with the villain and he starts doing a phony caribbean accent not funny not to mention jamie never seems to acknowledge the timing of a joke giving a comedic performance requires patience whereas he goes straight to the punchline whether it s the right time for it or not i m not even a big mike epps fan but even his performance is good in comparison to jamie s as a matter of fact this is the first time i felt somewhat relieved whenever he would appear on screen epps has the same flaws when it comes to comedy but at least he chooses a more low key approach one of the few bright spots in this clunker of a comedy is david morse a highly underrated actor mostly known for his supporting roles as villains he seems to be the only actor in the film concerned with grounding it in reality however fellow green mile star doug hutchison is disgustingly over the top as the villain a big surprise considering he gave a superb performance in the green mile also playing a heavy antoine fuqua has proved his directing chops in movies like the replacement killers and training day even in bait he shows he can direct a hell of an action sequence his only problem seemed to be in disciplining jamie foxx who probably improvised half the script with one bad joke after another unless you re a die hard fan of foxx please don t take the bait
model chris mccormack margaux hemingway is brutally raped by a teacher chris sarandon of her sister kathy mariel hemingway he is brought to trial but goes totally free he then rapes kathy objectionable and sick rape film this movie was advertised as an important drama dealing with rape what it is is a badly written and for the most part badly acted drama it purports to be sympathetic to the victim of the rape but shoves the scene in our face to be totally honest however hemingway s acting is so bad in that sequence that it loses any real impact it might have had the trial scenes were boring and predictable and the movie just went too far when year old mariel is raped thankfully that wasn t shown i do admit though that it did lead to a great ending when margaux grabs a gun and shoots sarandon dead but seriously having a young girl raped is just revolting acting doesn t help for instance margaux was no actress she was certainly a beautiful woman and an actual model i believe but her acting left a lot to be desired it lessens the film mariel was just ok but this was one of her first films sarandon does what he can as the rapist he wasn t bad but the terrible script worked against him i do remember hearing that at a screening of this back in some women stood up and cheered when sarandon was killed so maybe this works for some people i found this boring simplistic and really sick a all the way
to put it simply i am not fond of westerns and having never sat through one from beginning to end i decided to watch my darling clementine and see it all the way through no matter how painful it was for me at first it was excruciating as expected i found the acting to be laughable the scenery your standard dessert horses and cowboys boring and the music and its timing teetering on the edge of painful however after mentally pep talking myself to struggle on after the first minutes it began to be quite a bit easier for me to endure focusing in on the cinematography and how john ford managed to make even the dullest situations dull according to me that is look quite stunning at times made it a lot more interesting in conclusion i can t go so far as to say that i enjoyed the movie by the end of it however it was made well enough for me to sit all the way through to the very end and that in itself impresses me
let me start off by saying i am not a fan of horror movies i never watch them let me tell you about my experience the only reason i watched this movie was because my girlfriend and her friends wanted to see it over happy feet i never saw happy feet but i am sure it is better than this movie anyway we didn t actually expect it to be good we actually went in just to laugh at it cool with me i have a problem with ruining the movie for other people in the theater but since it was just other couples talking and making out it did not matter after minutes the other people left to go sneak into borat a movie i would have gladly seen again over this the movie was not scary and not stupid so it would be funny it was just boring it wasn t terrible like baby genuises terrible it was terrible like not entertaining at all avoid now i am no expert but it seems the problem with the horror industry these days is that you can have a pg horror that is boring and not scary or you can have an r gruesome horror movie that either is too bloody or too disgusting for people you want a pg horror that sucks but is funny see the grudge avoid this movie like the plague because it may literally bore you to death
no reason to bother renting this flick from the opening credits on i knew i was in trouble it was filmed as though it was a soft porn movie but there really isn t anything erotic about it the look into the world of sex addiction is intriguing but only to a point boring sex scenes bad plot and cameos by ed begley jr and rosanna arquette aren t enough to save this film
only reason i have seen dalmatians was its nominations for original song and costume design for the oscars i must admit that i was less than impressed with this film in this sequel cruella devil by the way glen close pulls off this role very well is released from the hospital due to her good behaviour she likes all sort of animals and locks all her furs away from that point we only wait until she starts having crises soon enough she does and tries to make the best coat of fashion world of course for herself and from fine dalmatian fur apart from glen close i found all cast quite silly but from a child s eye funny that is fair enough as its target market is i assume children under quite a good entertainment for children and families but didn t do much for me out of
tom wolfe s sprawling brilliantly observed satiric novel of life among new york snobbery gets a glossy look here but is nevertheless not well served the film suffers not merely from the miscasting of everyman tom hanks as an uncaring yuppie kewpie doll melanie griffith as a manipulative southern belle and bruce willis as the darling of new york s literati the most serious miscasting was in the director s chair robert altman might have breathed life into these unlikeable characters and made them interesting but brian de palma for all of his visual sophistication has never had an eye for the nuances of the human experience the resulting film looks good but seems blah toward its subject of dehumanization in favor of status honestly if a satire does not make the viewer angry what is the point
well i have to say this movie was so bad that i would have walked out if i didn t have to review it for work and the worst part is i wanted to see it so badly that i drove all over the city paid parking two times because the newspaper listings were wrong vince vaughn plays the guy he always does the only time i ve seen him play someone else was in that movie with john travolta anyways the plot has potential it sounded great in the preview but it is filled with totally ridiculous predictable weak plot turn points and i was hoping that this would be one christmas movie where christmas didn t have to be saved and that santa didn t need a replacdmetn but nope the only cool part was the sleigh rides and the little bladck kid was the best character i m sure this movie would be great for young kids but for adults it s so lame that it s chore to sit through
jim belushi is having a mid life crisis nothing is going right when his car goes out on him he goes into an empty bar where michael caine shows him what life wouldve been like if one event in high school had come out differently a good premise with some moments but mostly flat and uninteresting on a scale of one to ten
jean claude van damme plays twin brothers alex and chad both whom are martial arts expert who team up to take down the mobsters responsible for the murder of the parents in this empty headed martial arts actioner which doesn t have a plot that would make better use of the gimmick of having two jean claude van dammes some okay actionscenes but this is not one of van damme s best
raymond burr stars as an attorney caught up in the murder of his best friend dick foran thanks to his affection for his friend s wife angela lansbury this was a full year before he started doing perry mason so the movie might be of particular interest to his fans if it was the inspiration for his casting there isn t all that much else here that s interesting though lansbury is always good but her character here is very one dimensional and the motives for her crime in the mystery are totally obvious there s an interesting performance by lamont johnson as a painter who s also in love with the femme fatale but the burr character is pretty straightforward it s frankly bizarre to see an actor like burr doing these romantic scenes with lansbury and his halting delivery does not match his character here very well as it does in most films i ve seen him in there s no mystery at all really and the whole suspense is supposed to be around the title of the film and the way that burr s character is setting up the lansbury character to implicate herself double jeopardy prevents her being tried again for the original murder presumably he does so with a very large tape recorder which she doesn t notice when she comes into the room i guess a few perhaps unintentionally fun moments and basically the rest of the thing could have been done for tv
george brent is a reporter sent to interview an heiress she is supposedly the heir to a face cream fortune he interviews her on her yacht they fall for each other in bathing costumes it turns out quite early that she is not an heiress she part of an advertising campaign for the cold cream the movie follows the ups and downs of their romance the supporting cast does little to buoy it up davis and brent carry the picture though it s fairly predictable it is also fairly entertaining it s far from her best but especially considering its obscurity in her oeuvre it s not one of her worst either
watching this last night it amazed me that fox spent so much money on it and got so little back on their investment it s the kind of disaster that has to be seen to be believed i m sure that the first morning of filming raquel welch dusted off the shelf over her fireplace to prepare a spot for the academy award she would surely win for this daringly original movie oops that s not what happened the infighting on the set was detailed in print by rex reed and this helped the movie attain a reputation before it was even released when it was finally released there wasn t the usual three ring circus of publicity if i remember correctly in houston it opened at drive ins and neighborhood theatres and never played any of the big venues i lay most of the blame on director michael sarne who was hot after having directed the not all that good joanna a film with music about young people in swinging mod london if i recall correctly fox wound up firing him and piecing the film together the best they could that s why scenes play out in no particular sequence and characters appear and then vanish an impressive supporting cast kathleen freeman jim backus john carradine andy devine and others is wasted with nothing to do to expand it to feature length there are numerous clips from fox movies featuring stars like carmen miranda in amazing footage from the gang s all here andlaurel and hardy who never dreamed they d be playing in an x rated movie the x rating is due to occasional language numerous sexual perversions however none of the characters seem to be having any fun maybe somebody involved with the film had a warped puritan sensibility and figured that if they could make these things unappealing it wasn t bad to exploit them this was one of the youth pictures that nearly bankrupted hollywood in the s one writer joked that easy rider which was made for pocket change was the most expensive movie ever made because so many films followed which tried and failed in the worst way to duplicate its success sixtyish once honored directors like stanley kramer and otto preminger made movies like rpm and skidoo in an effort to attract a young audience white directors and writers attempted to make films to attract a black audience those movies are locked somewhere in a vault and the two named and many others from that genre have never as best i know been out on home video or cable they re the studios deep dark secret raquel welch s performance in this is all things considered very good with the right direction and script she could played the type of sassy liberated women rosiland russel and barbara stanwyck specialized in she looks great and has awesome costumes mae west is the liveliest seventy something actress i ve ever seen on the one hand it s kind of heartbreaking to watch her attempt to capture her glory from years gone by but i m sure she needed the money if you want to see a big budget x rated movie from this era check out beyond the valley of the dolls also from fox because it doesn t take itself seriously it s crazy kids playing with the equipment at a major studio myra breckinridge tries to say something there just wasn t anyone who wanted to listen
it wasn t the most pointless animation film experience ever but it certainly can t be admired as much as it tries to be good combining dreamworks animation and computer graphics this is the story of a mustang later named spirit matt damon providing the first person narration and his journey through across the frontiers of the old west basically he is born free amongst all the other horses in the beautiful countryside then he is kidnapped to be used as a saddle horse he manages to throw off all who try to ride him however when he escapes his cage along with little creek daniel studi the two of them form a friendship oh and he obviously has a thing for little creek s female horse in the end after a few more escapes being chased by the colonel james cromwell and his men and making a final big leap across a gorge little creek lets spirit go and he also releases his female horse and they run home to their countryside and fellow horses also starring chopper bernet as sgt adams jeff lebeau as murphy railroad foreman john rubano as soldier richard mcgonagle as bill and matthew levin as joe i was expecting to see the horses talk in this film but it turns out to be more like a dumbo thing throughout and the songs by bryan adams aren t the most engaging but it isn t a terrible film it was nominated the oscar for best animated feature and it was nominated the golden globe for best song for bryan adams here i am okay
ever this is the bottom i am not joking the theater should ve had a warning of some kind abandon all hope ye who enter here would ve been fitting i don t have the words to describe accurately the hell that this movie is its debilitating stupidity even fails to amuse this movie is definitely aimed at some of the slower turtles in the sandbox the story was blatantly stolen from a minute bugs bunny cartoon and then stretched like mr fantastic to excruciatingly painful minutes i remember when the wayans s were funny i guess the pressures of hollywood for them to produce produce produce are to blame for the poop that churns out at a consistent rate i m sad and offended that they think we are stupid enough to enjoy minutes of kick in the balls jokes with a thin plot based on a cartoon i disliked nearly everything about this movie i won t spoil anything but the baby is actually a midget with marlon wayans s face poorly superimposed over the midget s body what i did like was the ending not the movie s resolution but the actual end where we all stood up and walked out i gave this movie one star but it clearly deserves less i don t feel that the six minutes they spent writing the script is worth a star this does deserve a razzie and i pray to god it gets it when are people going to learn if you stop paying to see this idiocy they will stop pooping it out seppuku is a reasonable alternative to this film avoid it at all costs you have been warned
why oh why don t blockbuster movies simply stick to their selling point everyone in the cinema young and old was there to see talking animals make jokes and whilst they did that we were all happy and then as with lost in space came the two killer blows plot and sentiment who really cared what happened to the tiger or whether eddie murphy made up with his daughter not me that s for sure
i just saw if i can remember the advertisements for the movie from so i was interested in finally seeing it it may be the perspective of an american who never went to a british public school and misses some of the social references but i thought the movie was awful for one thing as others have pointed out it takes almost the entire movie for the much ballyhooed at the time revolt to break out for another whether the last scene is real or imagined what occurs isn t a revolt but a shooting rampage there s quite a difference i know it may be bad form to judge a movie on subsequent events but one cannot avoid doing it here one person wrote a message board posting asking us not to compare the end of movie to the incidents at columbine high school and virginia tech but if there s a scintilla of difference between klebold harris and cho on the one hand and travis malcom mcdowell on the other i simply can t see it all four of them were under the delusion that their gunfire is going to purify a f ed up world that they arrogantly take no responsibility for which brings me to why the hell are travis and his chums even in a school they so despise they are adults or close to it they re not in a military prison like the inmates in the hill a much better british film from about the same time no one is forcing them to go to college and take beatings from the the whips except maybe ambitious parents in need of a wake up about the nature of their sons i had the opportunity in college to join a frat except i couldn t stand to be given silly cruel orders by delinquents claiming to be my prospective brothers i took the consequences of not having the in with the establishment that frats provide and i can t say i regretted it if travis fancies himself the second coming of lenin whose unbearded picture hangs prominently in his room he s free to go out and organize a fitter s union or work for michael foot in the next election if he wants to be jack kerouac then get on the road and start writing what possible benefit is he giving the world in joyriding a motorcycle and getting drunk in his room sometimes reviewers have to be like the person who responded to the scene in last tango in paris where brando mopes about having had to go on a date with cow manure on his shoes in the real world the person said a listener would say why didn t you scrape it off change your shoes don t allow fictional characters to lay a self pity trip on you because you don t dare point out an common sense alternative course of action for them so it is here
the oddly named vera ellen was to movie dancing what sonja henie was to movie ice skating blonde girlish always delightful to watch but not an especially good actress and usually lumbered with weak material when i watch vera ellen s sexy apache dance with gene kelly in words and music i can t help noticing that her blouse yellow with narrow red horizontal stripes seems to be made out of the south vietnam flag for some reason the very american vera ellen starred in two musicals made several years apart set in edinburgh a city not noted for its tap dancers let s be happy and happy go lovely in the latter cesar romero plays an american impresario who for some reason is staging a musical in edinburgh there s a vague attempt to link this show to the edinburgh festival which is nonsense the festival is not a showcase for splashy leg shows we also see a couple of stock shots of the royal mile apart from a few highland accents there s absolutely no attempt to convey scottish atmosphere in this movie the funniest gag occurs at the very beginning when we learn that the title of romero s show is frolics to you this is a cheeky pun that britons will get and yanks won t vera ellen is as usual cute and appealing and an impressive dancer but the very few musical numbers in this movie are boring and bad the plot mistaken identity between magnate david niven and reporter gordon jackson is brainless though no more so than the plots of several dozen hollywood musicals romero is less annoying than usual here probably because for once he isn t required to convince us that he s interested in bedding the heroine the single biggest offence of this movie is its misuse of bobby howes the father of sally ann howes was a major star of west end stage musicals his wistful rendition of she s my lovely was a big hit in britain in here he shows up in several scenes as romero s dogsbody but never has a chance to participate in a musical number nor even any real comedy it s absolutely criminal that this movie with a title containing the word lovely sure to evoke howes s greatest hit would cast a major british musical star but give him nothing to do the delightful character actress ambrosine phillpotts whom i worked with once shines in one restaurant sequence and there s a glimpse of the doomed beauty kay kendall as vera ellen s confidante somebody named diane hart speaks in one of the most annoying voices i ve ever heard it sounds like an attempt to imitate joan greenwood and glynis johns both at the same go but doesn t match either val guest has a story credit but this movie doesn t come up to the quality of his brilliant comedies the colour photography is wretched though i realise that postwar britain could not afford hollywood s process work happy go lovely is at utmost best a pleasant time waster with waster being the operative word i ll rate this movie just out of
the worst film ever made after watching this supposedly gay made film i suspect someone rounded up a brain damaged half blind neo nazi and had him make the worst gay film ever all in some deluded attempt to attack gay culture i had to stop the movie and call a friend to come over just so i had someone to scoff at when i paused the movie out of shock disbelief and outrage at such sheer stupidity on top of all the horrible writing and acting and illogical and stupid plot its just a poorly made film a dog with a handycam tied to its tail could have churned out better seriously after reading the few positive reviews this movie has here i suspect the writer must have a half a dozen imdb accounts anyone who says this film is even watchable as anything other than a joke is a liar or being paid heavily to say so
this film was the worst film i have ever viewed it was like a homework assignment for a film class it totally misses the mark when it comes to the message it is trying to relay characters are over exaggerated poor acting and as for a plot well it is utterly ridiculous the cover shot is what made me think it may be a decent film the co actor is handsome and that s about it moral of this movie never judge a movie by it s cover save your time money and energy and make your own home movie and you will be far better off than i it was painful to watch and quite frankly i am surprised that anyone would spend money to make and distribute it
sorry but i will spoil both the plot line and the ending for you in hopes of avoiding a holiday fiasco like the one that i now face the father dies and the mother asks santa in a letter to bring him back to the family for christmas and santa does dad is peachy happy healthy and totally unaware of the fact that he had died all ends syrupy sweet but as a parent who recently watched my five year old lose his best canine friend it was a horror flick now my son is convinced that all he has to do to bring his buddy back is to ask santa do not underestimate the willpower of a young heart no amount of persuasion will convince him that it was only a movie and that his dog is not coming back for christmas it has been heart breaking to watch his joy only to know that christmas eve he will have to face his loss afresh shame on you on behalf of all the believers that have lost a loved one recently it is hard enough to deal with the loss one time for a child but there are some wishes that we shouldn t even portray as a possibility
don t waste your time or money on this one the half decent cast might fool you into thinking that this teen thriller whilst hardly about to break any records might lightly entertain for minutes it won t it won t make you scared laugh cry or even challenge your intellect it will leave you wondering how on earth this movie ever finished production yes it really is that poor
in the questionable comedy vein of mel brooks wholly moses tries to take the bible story of moses and make fun of it resulting in the unfunniest biblical spoof ever filmed there is no real plot here just excuses to trot out stalwart comedy talent in underwritten roles dudley moore and laraine newman are on a bus tour of the holy land when they stumble across an ancient scroll in a cave there they read the story of herschel and zerelda also played by moore and newman herschel s life parallels moses he was sent down the river to be found by the pharaoh s family at the same time moses was herschel s birth father the late james coco becomes herschel s slave after herschel is rescued by idol makers and works as a sculptor eventually herschel comes to work for the pharaoh as an astronomer is banished and ends up tending moses flock of sheep herschel and moses are brothers in law marrying sisters and herschel thinks god has chosen him to free his people in egypt of course moses was receiving the divine word but herschel misunderstood i ll pause here to laugh hysterically pause anyway the rest of the film is a series of badly written scenes involving moore and actors who are making special appearances these scenes do not propel the plot forward they bring what little story there is to a grinding halt jack gilford plays a tailor dom deluise has maybe three lines when he meets herschel in the desert john houseman is an archangel just giving the same line readings he gave in the paper chase david l lander is a fake blind man healed by herschel andrea martin is one of zerelda s sisters i was not sure who madeline kahn was supposed to be she gives a ride to herschel and has about a minute and a half of screen time john ritter plays a very unfunny devil richard pryor has one scene as the pharaoh but it was obviously shot at a different time than moore s scene because the two do not appear onscreen together in the end zerelda turns into a pillar of salt after looking back on new sodom s destruction ha ha herschel writes the ten commandments and gives them to moses who is basking in all the glory in the final scenes the screenwriter decide to try and salvage this shallow film by having herschel bait god into an argument god comes off as an all powerful bully who was leading herschel around for his own amusement speaking through him only to give him the ten commandments we even have zerelda quip god works in mysterious ways thereby excusing everyone s very unchristian behavior during the film this film is not funny there is nary a laugh to be found anywhere at least monty python made fun of many established religious mainstays in life of brian in addition to their questionable take on jesus life but here the humor consists of poo poo jokes and characters constantly bumping their heads this makes mel brooks look like merchant ivory churchgoers will be offended not by the film s attitude toward religion but by the smugness the movie exhibits impressed with their own hoitytoityness i know not a word on a subject they obviously know nothing about wholly moses is wholly bad and an embarassment to all involved i suggest you read the book instead this is rated pg for some physical violence profanity sexual references and adult situations
i hate this movie it was nothing like the book and just thinking about it makes me mad if you watch the movie before reading the book then yeah it s a good movie but king s book was amazing and this movie was nothing like it i mean the general meaning might be sort of similar but most aspects of the movie are completely different the ending for example so in the book it is extremely intense and danny and wendy escape seconds before the hotel explodes but in this horrible movie version jack like takes them through a stupid maze yeah there is no maze in the book and there is no reason for it another part that made me angry was that jack just kills mr halloran what the heck he is basically the hero of the book and they just kill him off like he wasn t important overall it was just bad that the movie was so extremely off
a novel by remarque a cast that looks great on paper a left wing refugee struggling to remain in paris between the wars a gestapo officer undercover it s a pity there s no synergy here the bits and pieces never coalesce stories about left wing refugees in france don t have to be this dull read arthur koestler s memoir scum of the earth if you can find it or his chilling dialogue with death ditto to me the only interest in this film lies in some of the incidental details the leads spend a lot of time drinking calvados the norman apple brandy i welcome any prompting to have a nip of calvados myself it certainly made this film appear to pass more quickly but according to the film it s only sold in cheap low class saloons vive le tabac parisien that s what i say references to intoxicating liquors do abound here that would seem to be a preoccupation of the scenarists i enjoy films set in france because it can be amusing waiting for the inevitable full size alcohol ad to pop up on a wall in the background i wasn t disappointed this time it was for byrrh a very unusual choice this film would rate a if only we were judging it on the refinement of its booze murals the film s indifferent score is by louis gruenberg gruenberg is best known if you can call it that for his opera the emperor jones based on the o neill play it premi red at roughly the same time as the film version starring paul robeson the opera survives today in a recording or two by lawrence tibbett it should surface again soon though they re running out of potentially marketable operas to revive opera seems an appropriate subject to mention here since charles boyer s character operates under his czech aliases two of them are wozzeck and gunther both prominent roles in german opera is that just coincidence name dropping just seems to be part of this film notice that they call up himmelstoss on the phone himmelstoss happens to be one of the main characters in remarque s earlier all quiet on the western front well the in jokes are all in place guess there wasn t time to develop any drama
the director outfitted in chains and leather warned the audience at the sf frameline film festival friday night that we were about to see an experiental film experimental leave the video camera on the back seat of the car let the tape roll and edit in all the pointless dreck within eyesight a meandering pastiche road show manqu that starts nowhere and takes the audience no place the gratuitous violence that opens the movie drove more than one patron from the castro theater i would have left too but my cine buddy needed a ride home and has this thing about seeing even the worse merde through to the end by the time the lights came up the audience had thinned considerably tepid applause pro forma questions of the director who seemed pleased with the product avoid this film
it is incredible yes someone before me wrote that it was a time wasting to seat and watch this film it is don t do so i m totally rankled i liked wesley snipes and i founded funny that he played his name s meaning in a movie anyway i wanted to see this film at home only of course but now just after i am absolutely disappointed it was his worst movie ever inwatchable bad actor play bad cameraman bad scenario only one good think that wonderful girl must be a manikin surely eeeeh mb lines minimum i don t want to waste you re time anymore to read my opinion i hope i was clear and under stable because english is not my native method of speaking so have grate time and see good films like i try too peace
did the movie makers even preview this before they released it the script jumps from place to place without giving much explanation the beginning doesn t clarify if its a prequel or not it starts with superman s beginnings on earth and then jumps to a point after the last movie but doesn t really alert the viewer of this very confusing superman himself is weak and in need of prozac he is portrayed as a potential home wrecker a stalker and someone who is clearly depressed and confused this type of character rarely makes for an interesting hero the ending is absolutely ridiculous superman ending up in a hospital just made me want to kill him off myself i m seriously waiting for a snl skit where superman appears on maury povich and maury says the results are in in the case of the child superman you are the father to sum up ok acting by this superman and kevin spacey but horrible script the movie is basically unwatchable
this movie was worth five punches on my hurter card i saw this while stationed in virginia in the mid s i saw it alone so i was not distracted while i watched it it sucked it was the most ridiculous total waste of celluloid i ve ever seen i know that others who have reviewed this movie have thought that it was awesome i offer you this if it was so awesome what was it s box office take end of discussion
so don t even think about renting this from the shops because this is one hell of a bad movie you d think that jj abrahams had written this movie basically a rat is flushed down the toilet and somehow has to get back out fans of the completely terrible shrek might enjoy but wallace gromit fans will probably turn away in disgust also why didn t they do it in plasticine or clay i mean cgi animation for an aardman movie obviously aardman lazed around while they let dreamworks do the whole thing wrong wrong wrong nearly every single character is awful apart from that freaky frog guy who is just right for a movie villain but everything else about the movie is dull dull dull i almost fell asleep with boredom watching this movie no wait actually i did fall asleep with boredom watching this movie it s just terrible but thankfully it s not as bad as shrek
this is one of the worst horror movies i have ever seen unfortunately i am a horror movie buff and will rent any horror movie unless it s not made for t v when looking at the box it says it is rated r for gore and some language where was the gore was their one good death scene where you actually saw gore i could have overlooked that if there had been some brief nudity or some good dialogue there wasn t even one remotely witty or amusing line in this lame movie sometimes horror movies are awesome because they are so stupid but this was just sad
robert colomb has two full time jobs he s known throughout the world as a globetrotting tv reporter less well known but equally effortful are his exploits as a full time philanderer i saw vivre pour vivre dubbed in english with the title live for life some life robert seems to always have at least three women in his life one mistress on her way out one on her way in and the cheated wife at home it helps that robert is a glib liar among his most useful lies are i ll call you tomorrow and my work took longer than planned he spends a lot of time and money on planes trains and hotel rooms for his succession of liaisons you wonder when this guy will get caught with his pants down some may find his life exciting but i thought it to be tedious his companions including his wife catherine are all attractive and desirable women but his lifestyle is so hectic and he is so deceitful you wonder if he s enjoying all this adding to the tedium is considerable footage that doesn t further the plot there are extended sections with no dialogue or french only dialogue we see documentaries of wars torture and troop training interspersed with the live action when robert s flight returns from africa we wait and wait for the plane to land and taxi to the airport terminal annie girardot is the standout performer in this film hers was the most interesting character and she played it to perfection it was also nice to see candice bergen at the beginning of her career i can t find fault with yves montand s performance of what was basically an amoral bum i enjoyed some of claude lelouch s novel techniques in a hotel room scene the camera pans around the room as robert and his mistress argue we catch sight of them briefly during each pass around the room in another scene set on a sleeping car of a train robert is lying on the upper bunk while his wife is on the lower robert is giving his wife some important but distressing news but we hear only parts of it because of the clatter of the train i sensed that his wife was also unable to absorb every word due to the shocking nature of the news i also liked the exciting safari scenes in africa the cinematography of those scenes and of those in amsterdam was superb i reviewed this movie as part of a project at the library of congress i ve named the project fifty notable films forgotten within years as best i can determine this film like the other forty nine i ve identified has not been on video telecast or distributed in the u s since its original release in my opinion it is worthy of being made available again
this one of the best celebrity s reality shows a ever saw we can see the concerts we can see the life of britney i love the five episodes i was always being surprised by britney and the subjects of the show i think that some people don t watch the show at all we can how a great person she his she his really funny really gentle and she loves her fans and we can see how she loves her work i just don t give a because of k fed he his a real jerk he doesn t seem to like britney at all i they make a second season of this great show because it shows at some people how britney really is go britney your the best and you will never leave our hearts
i should have never watched this movie the style of filming may be considered artsy to some but it is considered migraine inducing to me i think it may have had an interesting plot but since i couldn t watch it for long stretches at a time i missed a lot the flickering pictures and stop motion filming branded my brain i stopped watching mid way through and won t be back for a second try i suppose if i were home alone in my own lighthouse some dark and stormy evening this might be just the ticket ps not sure if the lighthouse film style thing can be considered a spoiler but i don t want to be blacklisted on my first review
effort aside this isn t a review about good intentions its about the final product this film is poorly written overacted and poorly directed the story obviously had potential but that story is nowhere present in this film clara barton was a human being she had passions desires love pain embarrassment weakness and self doubt just like the rest of us you would never know that from this film of the lead actress s performance in fact apply that to every character in the film but in barton s case every sentence is a speech an epic over the top speech as though from an inhuman robot in fact the only scene that plays well in one in the board meeting and i realized thats because she s making a speech every idea she has is unbelievable in its context and she comes up with ideas that sound like they take a lifetime of soul searching right on the spot for example when she sees a wounded man she ll start pontificating about the needs of the battlefield and to protect soldiers and putting up white flags etc as played in the film there s no way she could come up with such a detailed well thought out idea in seconds in conclusion this film robs clara barton of her struggles it robs her of her humanity and it inherently cheapens all she did because the script is written in clich s the writer doesn t know clara barton and seems to have based his script on an encyclopedia britannica article yes they had those back then but hey nice technicolor who cares
bad plot though good for a b movie good fast paced fight scenes at most a out of but something has always bothered me about this film how come mariska hargitay never speaks in the tv version she shares several intimate moments with jeff speakman even a kiss in a garden yet in the regular video version most of her scenes are cut and she never speaks at all this bothers me because it not only takes out a female though cliched point of view to the film it also makes the final shot seem creepy this film would have been better had they kept her scenes in because in those scenes at least she has a personality one that undercuts whatever speakman says
yet again one of the most misunderstood goddesses of my country has been twisted by westerners who cannot understand the esoteric symbolism of the mother goddess in her dark forms the mother takes on the frightening form of kali mata to destroy our inner demons and to terrify our egos and though blood sacrifice is given to kali and durga the events depicted in this film are just absurd the mother takes on a wrathful form to be wrathful to our inner demons limitations and ego when no other form will suffice it s also in her wrathful form that she burns away all your karmas in the smashan fires that you cultivate in your heart for her to dance on if you love her and she will bring you to reality and truth reality and truth has a dark side as well as light which serves a purpose the mother is the embodiment of the physical universe as well she is nature nature can be cruel and destructive to maintain balance you cannot have growth and life without death and destruction kali represents the force of destruction for the purpose of new growth and life both mundane and spiritual in the universe it s very outrageous to me that people who know nothing of india or it s divinity can just take one of our beloved goddesses and use her like a cheap prostitute to make some low budget talentless horror film how dare they take our beloved mother and portray her as a horror that makes people chop their eyelids off she is only horrific to those who are attached to their ego and who live in delusion greed anger and other inner demons it s very clear to me that the person who wrote this movie must have a very serious self deluding ego and serious inner demons to see kali as so horrible and terrible when the ego drops away she becomes a form that is enchanting beautiful and young a beauty that is so enchanting to behold that she enchants the entire universe with it kali maa is an ancient mother not to be trifled with for the sake of entertainment let s just hope that in her endless compassion and mercy that she does not take on wrathful form to those involved with this movie the audacity that westerners have in using religions like my own or the religions of the caribbean islands such as santeria and vodou which are actually very positive and other such religions to twist and exaggerate misunderstood elements that the western mind cannot comprehend is totally ridiculous it s clear that there is no respect for what people live breathe and believe in when it comes to these kind of flicks kali maa in reality is a caring and compassionate mother whom we shed tears at her beautiful feet in devotion and love for and i am happy that my mother takes on wrathful form sometimes to protect her devotees from themselves and from outside forces many praises to the real kali maa who has shown many the path of god and realization
this film had a lot of promise and the plot was relatively interesting however the actors director and editors seriously let this film down i feel bad for the writers it could have been good the acting is wooden very few of the characters are believable who ever edited this clearly just learnt some new edit techniques and wanted to splash them all over the film there are lots of quick flashy edits in almost every scene which are clearly meant to be symbolic but just end up as annoying i wanted to like this film and expected there to be a decent resolution to the breakdown of equilibrium but alas no it left me feeling like i d wasted my time and the film makers had wasted their money
this is perhaps the creepiest display of santa claus ever committed to any medium whether it be a book a picture or a movie santa looks like a perv looking down on the children and the twisted story of bringing merlin in to help him defeat one of satan s minions pitch doesn t make things any better it s laughable to say the least with bad effects even for standards if a kid were to watch this movie he d have nightmares and never want santa to visit they d be scarred for life imagine the kid s in a christmas story when they start screaming after being put on santa s lap that s how this would turn out if kid s see this movie
i had such high hopes for this film because i loved the original so much it seems that disney however is trying to perfect the art of crappy straight to dvd sequels they deserve a razzie several in fact i thought the idea had merit but the music was absolutely awful and the story wasn t much better what happened to the great music disney used to have in their films mary poppins aladdin beauty and the beast the lion king even hercules and the hunchback of notre dame they ve made so many great movies over the years that it s really sad that they ve sunk to point of making sequels that aren t even good enough to put in theatres i hope this movie is not an indication of things to come for the walt disney corporation
boring long pretentious repetitive self involved this move felt like a bad date worse the tedious art school direction with a heavy handed use of the whirling shot that gets so overdone it almost made me throw up is constantly screaming to be noticed add the thinnest of plots and virtually no dialogue and the film begins to feel like a four hour epic about minutes in it gets worse instead of dialogue there are poorly written voice overs and quotes and songs that comment all too obviously on the characters really loud opera music too blame it all on the director the actors are all quite good the lead actor miguel angel hoppe is particularly suited for film stardom he and the other actors have some tender erotic moments even these start to get boring after minutes however and one wonders if the director is auditioning for a bel ami porn job the stunning college campus architecture as a location in mexico city is inspiring how come universities in the us are so bland sfsu uc etc but wait for the dvd on this film you ll want to use the fast scan button a lot
ohhh man now this is what i m talking about as far as bad cheesy horror flicks go this movie was truly in a class of its own a real gem first off the film wasn t originally in english that s okay because the voice dubbing was truly exceptional here is my favorite excerpt from the dialog and there is plenty more where this came from i m feeling a little better i m just thirsty for your blood and what drama here is a play by play recap of the interaction between the military and scientists scene scientist you can t do that it ll be a disaster military officer that s just science fiction he then proceeds to cause a complete disaster just like the scientist predicted scene scientist if you do that many people will die military officer you don t know what you re talking about he does it and many people die scene scientist don t do that it ll kill everyone military officer that s nonsense he then proceeds to kill everyone scene you get the idea if that wasn t enough there were a few scenes that really stood out as instant classics in one scene the military has literally guys pointing guns at two unarmed men the leader yells go get em and all army guys one at a time drop their guns and fist fight the two adversaries instant classic and don t worry no attention to detail was left out this movie even had a hip upbeat s keyboard synth soundtrack to set the mood and trust me i realize this review might contain some spoilers but there are so many goodies in this epic i really only scratched the surface a movie of this caliber only comes out once a decade a true movie watching experience a masterpiece wow
the one sheets and newspaper campaign suggested as often they did a far more lurid and violent piece than showed up on the drive in screens claude brook is actually an americanization of claudio brook who worked in films for years this one s quite hard to find anymore i d love to see it again to compare it to other international horrors of the day but don t remember particularly impressed way back when chances are it was a chopped up version that made it to u s theatres and video but oh that one sheet still a gem of my later horror collection
i loved the batman tv series and was really looking forward to this but they tried to do too much why they had the story of adam west and burt ward trying to recover the batmobile was beyond me i don t want to knock burt or adam for the way they look now it s been years since they appeared at batman and robin but to see them dressed in dress suits and fighting badguys was kinda sad i would rather of just seen the ex stars do commentary the batmobile side story was stupid as for the flashback movie i think it was too short and left out way too much it was really just a quick overview in my opinion i d like more background they showed the penguin and joker for about a minute each just to tell the same stuff i already knew the joker had a mustache under his makeup and the penguin had to smoke even though he hated it and was an ex smoker that was it on those i d love to read the book i am sure it has more in it that this showed like why was there riddlers or why catwoman s or mister freezes where was commishioner gordon cheif ohara alfred mister freeze king tut etc the list goes on like i said even the ones that were in this one were barely in it very disappointing and really corny
bad movie for sure it s such a ridiculous fantasy with a lot of poor special effects a lot of hasty scenes the airport one for example and a real unfunny time charles dance is awful as the evil guy and he is much better in last action hero eddie murphy is doing a non comic joking and i heard that this sunk had already succeed big time success i ll never understand why or how in one tv interview i ve heard eddie murphy himself when he was nominated for an oscar regretted it in a comic way one of the comments said hey it s the s well no my friend it s the cinematic foolishness which made a lot of razzie movies all over the years whether it s the s or the s there are reasons made me write about this movie the first is that i ll never forget the long tan fascinating legs of charlotte lewis especially when she was on bed before the bad guys attack her house wearing just a blue shirt and oh boy the camera was versifying about her naked legs as it should be but how odd as i ve watched her in following movies and she wasn t that beautiful again anyhow the second reason is that i ve found this movie s title lately at my list of the worst movies ever the bottom line bad movie greeeeeat legs
i saw this movie once and i thought it was ok then my friends at work said watch it again it s better so i did and to my surprise it was worse on the second time there s a word limit so i m going to get the ball rolling here the bombing scenes were all so stupid why on earth would anyone wait to trigger the explosion none of the characters here are even remotely likable not on the first time not even the second oh and last time i checked a car does not explode from a single gun shot nor can a fire that huge be put out with a tiny fire extinguisher did the above viewers actually watch the movie the camera is so shaky i can barely tell what is going on that opening scene with the robot had my stomach off put the rest of the movie was not much better the sniper scene the mcmanus brothers from the boondock saints would roll their eyes it was so stupid first off why did the guy plant his gun where one person had gotten shot furthermore why would he spend that much time cleaning the bullets reloading aiming and not get shot when there was so much chaos going on around him sas types running instead of staying and fighting back huh are the soldiers gay i didn t mean to sound homophobic but honestly that scene was so ridiculous too long for its own good yet too short for the amount of material crammed into it bigelow seems to think that the more action the better looks like she is wrong the movie is full of superfluous action scenes thrown in there to distract you from the lack of a central plot i know watchmen is longer at minutes but at least that movie didn t drag this movie on the other hand does and for it feels longer the only good thing was renner who was satisfactory at best but do yourself a favour just skip this and don t give into the hype
iowa wants to be requiem for a dream for midwest meth but it comes across as a hard r rated reefer madness yes drugs are bad and meth is horribly pernicious as an addiction and how it destroys people families and communities but these characters who are either dumb or ridiculous and the eye rolling plot won t teach that lesson to anyone while writer director star matt farnsworth has some charisma on screen his partner diane foster plays a wincibly silly wide eyed innocent corrupted by drugsas was already satirized by susan sarandon in the rocky horror picture show i really felt sorry for her for all the totally unnecessary nudity she was put through it wasn t until the end of the film that i realized i was supposed to think these two were recent high school graduates to explain some of their naivet as we are bombarded by their school photos but if so they even looked older than the folks on the o c while they have good chemistry on screen they are a pale imitation of a badlands type couple the guest stars are badly used michael t weiss who was so good in tv s the pretender is completely ludicrous as a corrupt parole officer and his brutal violence is just plain crazy as his character pretty much ruins any social significance for the film rosanna arquette has to be even sleazier than she rolled around for david cronenberg as a very low rent livia soprano john savage even has to mouth the old baby boomer excuses about i did pot but this is worse a goth chick shows up with the odd explanation that she s a stripper from des moines the obligatory latino drug dealer appears in iowa with a limited budget the interior view of meth use is portrayed quite vividly with quite scary hallucinations we certainly see them go crazy while the iowa locations are used very well including an amusing scene of a propane gas robbery the accents and church references are confusingly southern baptist guns seem to be used by law abiding and law breaking citizens here more than in any inner city drug dealing movie the songs of iowa s best known bard greg brown are used throughout but oddly are not listed in the credits i hope they were used with permission i caught this at its commercial run in nyc because i missed it at the tribeca film festival where it got considerable and inexplicable buzz
this movie is weak the box cover says east la s toughest gang and it is really santa ana s james cahill acts like a closet queen taking down all the tough guys in the tough chlo gang it is fake boring senseless and whack i tried to get my money back from the video store this movie was so bad it was also on the homo erotic tip far from what the video box proclaims james cahill should act in gay porno james is in every scene he cannot act to save his life the film features eva longoria who is hot but james can t even score with her i felt at times i was watching gay porn and was turned off by the whole film james clearly want s to be with men but rather then submit to his gay desires he beats up gang members over and over and over again his martial arts skills are minimal at best some real gang members would take him and his weak skills and rip him a new one
this film sold for one dollar at wal mart on a dvd and so i do not feel like i lost anything for watching this film except my time enjoyed the acting of tom hanks robbie wheeling who was very young looking and gave an outstanding performance considering it was a horrible script the story is about college students who decided to play the game mazes monsters only in a very realistic setting robbie wheeling has had problems in the past playing this game at other colleges and is advised by his parents to leave the game alone and get good grades robbie meets a very nice gal and has a romantic fling with her and once he starts playing the game he stops making love to her and acts like a monk there are some scenes in the film which are taken running around the former world trade center and also in the observation floor and roof area it is rather sad viewing this part of the film where so many human beings died because of evil in the world this is not a very good film except for tom hanks trying to keep the film above the sinking level of entertainment
after being a big fan of the ten minute t v episodes of stella street i awaited this film with excitement and anticipation unfortunately i was left feeling very disappointed i was dismayed by the way that nearly all of the gags and one liners were directly lifted from the t v episodes and delivered with much less enthusiasm and comic timing as if the actors had said them once and couldn t be bothered to say them again i bought my copy on dvd and felt cheated that i had parted with my hard earned cash to watch the same jokes over again spoilers the plot of the film starts with stella street a normal english street in surrey gradually being populated by some of the most famous people from stage and screen of the last forty years including michael caine al pacino jack nicholson and the rolling stones all the celebrities in the street end up being conned out of their entire fortunes by a local fraudster and are forced to live like tramps and common working class people there are some nice moments but on the whole the writers manage to take an interesting idea and make it pretty boring end of spoilers in the t v episodes all the characters are performed by john sessions and phil cornwell including females but in the film ronni ancona is added to the cast i think this was a mistake her impersonations weren t funny and it felt like her characters were included in the story just to give her something to do if you were not a fan of the episodes of stella street you may find this film entertaining but if you were a fan i think you may walk away feeling a little bit cheated
bernard rapp passed away last year and was a very cultured journalist cinema was one of his biggest passions he penned a vast worldwide dictionary of films and so he was bound to wield a camera at least one time in his life but the films he left garnered lukewarm reviews tir part in spite of terence stamp s sensational performance was very caricatured in the depiction of the characters une affaire de go t was a slick affair even if bernard giraudeau delivered a perverse performance pas si grave was another let down and un petit jeu sans cons quence is as underwhelming as its predecessors its comic potential is exploited in a flimsy way and however the starting idea let predict a twirling spiritual comedy a couple held by yvan attal and sandrine kiberlain who invited their friends is in full moving in a lascivious mansion to play with their guests they pretend to part company with each other and things don t go as planned because the announcement of their separation doesn t surprise them the two lovers start to ponder about the validity of their couple in spite of lush scenery and the promising material he had at his disposal rapp s undistinguished directing can t manage to give life to this game with unexpected consequences the plot follows a well worn pattern with characters who have specific well known functions and masks that are unveiled about who they really are verbal or situation comic effects often fall flat a bad editing fades a little more the film with this bad habit from rapp to abruptly cut many sequences even the actors sincere input in the venture is debatable they seem to be bored and to recite their texts than to live them especially sandrine kiberlain the audience is soon caught in a deep torpor it s regrettable to say it bernard rapp s films never lived up to his intentions as un petit jeu sans cons quence bears witness
spoiler warning first of all i rated this movie out of the idea is good but there are too many stupid errors in the movie failing to make it the psyching drama that it might have been first of all she never fights alone after an initial very strange doubt from her mother which is not believable when the mother proves to be so supportive and loving later in the movie the rape victim is not alone she is also unbelievably naive always falling into the crew s strange traps her friends are unbelievably nasty the thing that i find most unbelievably is that ethan fails to control the crew when he changes his opinon ethan is very much the leader of the crew hey they even say so and people seem to think the other guy is a jerk but when ethan changes his opinion he just doesn t manage to convince even one single person in the crew that he is right and that his former friend is wrong everyone just simply hates him why the movie provides no explanation how did he ever become the leader a funny note is that my girlfriend thought i was watching beverly hills when she came in two actors from the same successful tv series a cheap way to get viewers
offering a killer combo of terrible writing terrible acting and terrible direction it s a tossup whether kinjite forbidden subjects is offensively bad or just hilariously bad it s almost as if someone ran a competition to make the sleaziest seediest cannon film as if a glance at a cast list including characters like lesbian pedophile perverted gentleman porno actress weren t enough it s your only chance to see charles bronson s cop throw a lowlife on a bed and grab a dildo but don t worry it s okay as the offscreen screams make clear he s only torturing him for information after all even if he is a bit overprotective of his nice catholic daughter he s a nice catholic cop who regularly brings local catholic priest william o connell a packed lunch and who believes in poetic justice or at least ensuring that the bad guys end up in the slammer with the horniest inmates maximum security can provide to give them a taste of their own medicine but then that s what you get for telling him look i think you re a little bit unstable still when later offered a bribe he may snarl i d like to shove this up your ass but i don t want to get my hands dirty he s clearly learned where to draw the line instead he just makes him eat a watch and sets fire to his cadillac the anal obsession even follows through to the film s title despite the poster featuring a naked japanese girl on a porn film set the film s only direct example of kinjite forbidden subjects as alex hyde white s english teacher explains to a group of japanese businessmen is er talking about your bowel movements in polite society bronson isn t just too old for this as the opening fight makes only too clear he s too old for love interest peggy lipton and she looks old enough to have grown up kids a better actor than he ever got the credit for when given the right material here s he s given less a properly thought out character than a series of outrageous reactionary quirks when he s not widening the circles of suspects he s accidentally dropping them to their death off the sides of buildings he s definitely not a p c copper with a special loathing for the japanese as if it wasn t bad enough that they re buying up american businesses what s worse they double park on a public thoroughfare no racial minority goes unassaulted be they black pimp or pakistani hotel clerk no cop clich unrecycled be it a boss who bangs his fist on the table or a dead meat partner perry lopez and his spectacularly bad hair dye that s so prominent it deserves screen billing all its own the twin plot strands bronson s l a cop trying to take down juan hernandez s pimp who deals in underage girls and james pax s porn obsessed japanese businessman take forever to intertwine and then in the most unlikely of ways after copping a feel of bronson s daughter on a bus some oriental guy touched my holy of holies in the film s idea of poetic justice pax finds his own daughter kidnapped by hernandez you half expect the writer to pop his head round the corner of the screen and say how d ya like them apples somewhere underneath all the laziness is the germ of a good idea even if it is too muddily developed to ever be clear quite what that idea really is but the execution is pure rising sun the archie bunker version shot like out takes from an r rated s music video with an outrageous and rather lazy dockside shoot em up and blow em up finale that sees a small army of machine gunning sidekicks suddenly appear to up the gratuitous body count the last of bronson s mostly bad to in different collaborations with j lee thompson and sadly thompson s last film as director it s a poor signoff for two undervalued players who increasingly never seemed to be that discerning about what pictures they said yes to
i was searching through hollywood video last night with a friend trying to find a good looking horror movie to watch over the new year s weekend as i was looking through the shelves severed spotted my eye and i grabbed it off the shelf and it looked like it might be a decent b grade horror movie the cover looked fairly good the plot sounded semi interesting so i rented it what a mistake don t be fooled by the cover which actually looks decent i m thinking that more money was spent on the cover artwork than the movie itself the film follows two police detectives who are tracking down a voodoo inspired ritualistic serial killer called the head hunter who is decapitating victims left and right in some unnamed city probably los angeles and they become drawn into his world of ritualized murder story sound somewhat good well it is and this movie could ve been halfway decent but good god it was bad almost everything about it was laughable the opening scene features some redheaded actress in a car trying to talk on this huge outdated cell phone and for whatever reason she goes outside and talks to some guy then a shadow comes up behind them hacks off his head and the girl drops to the ground and starts crawling for absolutely no reason while trying to dial sound ridiculous yep you bet it is the entire movie looks like it was filmed on a vhs quality camera and i m assuming it was the acting was mostly awful and the special effects were far from believable and the scenes with the policemen on the phone were awful the voice on the other line was echoing and it sounded like it was being recorded in someone s bathroom everything about this movie was simply amateurish and tedious and it didn t hold my interest for very long and i often found myself bored and tired mostly because of the bad acting and the horrible cinematography the pacing was bad everything was just bad overall severed is a failed attempt at what could have been a decent b movie the plot was good and i think if this film had been handled better and had a higher budget it could ve been alright but this movie fell flat on it s face if you re expecting something semi decent you ll be sorely disappointed only recommended if you can tolerate d grade horror flicks otherwise you ll probably want to stay away from this straight to video garbage it had a little potential but it was beyond a mess
i must say that during my childhood i m quite proud of a lot of the movies i ve rented the exception being theodore rex talk about the all time swindler movie in any actor s resume could you just imagine what whoopie s fired agent must have told her to sign on to this piece of crap hey whoop you ever seen that show dinosaurs yeah well they re making a movie out of it and you get to see germany after that that agent must have referenced star wars a lot this movie was so bad i figured whoopie must have bought out every copy of this film and had it destroyed i just wish she could have done the same thing to my memory because my sister still gives me crap for watching that movie i mean c mon i ll even admit i watched mr nanny and kazzam in theaters good reasons why i gave up on both hulk hogan and shaq for awhile yet this one sticks out in my mind as the worst of my childhood and the biggest rental regret of my life and that was years ago i m now if you want to do the math whenever i think of my all time list of worst movies i don t even mention this one because like a raped step child i try hard to repress that it ever happened screw you whoopie just be glad people only acknowledge eddie and sister act as your worst you lucky stiff
today i wrote this review in anger at uwe boll and hollywood hollywood has produced movies based on one of the darkest days of our nation changed everything it changed our perception of security it changed our understanding of the evil of man and humanity most importantly and devastatingly it changed our world however i can t not stress how utterly repulsed disillusioned and angry i am at the careless blatant ignorance of hollywood seeking to make a lucrative profit out of death and destruction this film and those like it are bound to cause controversy amid word of mouth among moviegoers and critics alike most surely to be echoed by the mainstream press hollywood has sunk to a new low even lower than the low down bastards who perpetrated the most barbaric acts of savagery and unrelenting cruelty behind it all is uwe boll i am very angry at this movie how dare they disrespect the memories of families of those lost how dare they mock the lives of the brave men and women who risked their lives to save those trapped in the doomed towers on that fateful day of infamy how dare they try to satirize and at the same time capitalize on a national tragedy in the mist of a mourning and weary post world how dare they to those who have the gall to even think of seeing this morally appalling travesty i say this with a heavy heart with all my strength remember think back to that day and ask yourself whether or not you are a sane and moral person think back to that day ask yourself whether or not this film is a disgrace and dishonor to the lives lost on that day think back to that day of the outcry of families of loved ones think back to that day of the lives lost on those two planes think back to the further carnage it caused following the attacks ask yourself if you have a soul think remember respect the memories of the lives lost on by not seeing this film at all

this kind of inspirational saccharine is enough to make you sick it telegraphs its sentiments like the biggest semaphore on earth it removes from the audience its own interpretation and feeling by making the choices for it the big finish is swimming in weeping orchestration that must supposed to work like jumper cables on a dead car i guess you d need such prompting to feel if you re stupid enough to watch a film as simple minded and sappy as this streep glows and you wonder if she really has the depth of feeling on display or if it s just that a display switched on and off like a light because i can t for the life of me see how she could possibly find life in such a dud of film even though it s based on a true story and an inspirational one at that i m sure the set up execution and performances play like a third rate tv movie or half witted high school drama
what can i say a kamal hassan movie being horrible he acts very well but it is a horrible story along with horrible direction in my kind opinion the director gautham menon must give up directing there is a lot of tragedy throughout the movie apart from that one can just not believe how true were those horrendous crimes there was no practicality in the movie gautham is just running out of stories but both kamal hassan and jyothika act really well the villains look too ugly though their performance was not bad i do not think this is a sunday afternoon movie like padayappa which you can see with the family you will not get sleep seeing this movie however harris jayaraj again did a great job and that is why i have given this movie out of his song partha modail nallae is soulful and soothing apart from that great cinematography on the whole this is just a bad bad movie kamal hassan i think should have rejected this movie
what i think i ll probably like best about the new star wars film phantom menace is that it will likely blow titanic out of the water if you ll pardon the pun when it comes to sheer devastating box office receipts and thereby knock it out of the number one spot every time i hear someone declare titanic is the greatest film they ve ever seen i think to myself you don t see a lot of movies do you what a travesty you could make good films that are a lot better than titanic and for the same price tag well it won lots of academy awards lots of people really loved it as someone might say in its defence well lots of people like the spice girls and billions and billions of people eat at mcdonald s but that doesn t mean it s high quality yes millions of elvis fans can be wrong i ll be the first to admit that part of the problem for me was the mega hype over the film i waited a month or so to see it and ultimately it didn t live up to the expectations set upon it which simply called more attention to the appallingly stupid love story it s true phantom menace will likely suffer a similar fate but james cameron s titanic is a a cheesy action flick thinly disguised as a serious period piece b a three hour epic that has it s finest moments given away in the trailer c a sappy love story beyond belief or entertainment d something left better to documentarians which i would ve enjoyed much more e a film with arrogance that lives up to the level demonstrated with the real ship f a robbery of hours that i will never get back therefore the greatest motivation for a time machine i can think of when i meet someone who hasn t seen it yet i say i wish i could trade places with you g a slap in the face to any genuine victim of hypothermia how long are we supposed to believe that people can be immersed in freezing cold water and still form intelligible sentences h thankfully a film that wasn t recognized for any acting achievements at the oscars i a technological achievement in filmmaking and little else the only reason i post this as a anonymous comment is i do not welcome the rebuttal of thirteen year old leonardo dicaprio fans who ll no doubt come to his defense and i am not really interested in hearing a defense of titanic s story acting or length
words can t simply describe how awful this film is i watched it on video last night and i simply could not believe what i was seeing basically snakeeater is about an ex military man lorenzo lamas and his search for his kidnapped sister who has been held captive by deliverance style rednecks the film s acting writing direction photography and editing are deplorable along with a song called soldier that has to be one of the worst theme songs of all time however there is one treat horshack ron pallio from welcome back carter is in the film playing a laughable bad guy otherwise please avoid this mess at all costs
i wonder if there is any sense of sense in this movie its a big joke good its entertaining you get to see the most stupid plot played very seriously in the form of a film i wonder which audience group this movie is basically targeted to priety a pros plays a surrogate mom for a happy couple salman rani who want a child but can t i wonder how it would be if this drama was a real life take off from a real couple s life rani appears happy with another pretty lady in her house who has been brought in to make a child for her salman she cares for priety and tries pushing her husband salman to preity so they may have some romance when will the audience get fed up of salman s nakhras though a good past time this movie is unbearable absurd
an attempt at crossover to appeal to those who don t appreciate opera exploiting the fame of one of the greatest opera singers of all time it fails badly all that is desirable in this movie is the opera and one can best find a recording of pavarotti doing what he does best the plot revolves around a romance with a doctor who heals his throat which has suddenly become troublesome only because it came out so long ago is it largely forgotten like most opera stars pavarotti is a decent actor and has stage presence aside from his singing talent and nothing that he does in this movie negates that opinion his culpability lies in not rejecting the horrid script perhaps because great operas can have silly stories he tolerated this one who knows except those involved do we need to know the plot is weak and trite this movie is like trudging through cold mud to pick off a few juicy tidbits the opera music hanging above the mud we have other ways in which to appreciate the great pavarotti and this one isn t one of them just get one of his many superb opera or vocal concert recordings and recognize the master tenor where he is most suited it would be one of imdb s worst films if more people remembered it and gave it some votes it would fit neatly in a list including several efforts of singers actors models and athletes to exploit their popularity through film very often it all goes badly wrong due to incompetent acting or a horrible script pavarotti would have been a decent actor had he not shown such a superb voice however effective he is as an actor opera requires it not even jimmy stewart could have rescued this turkey of a script i give it a polite of because someone may have become a fan of pavarotti s singing and of opera because of this movie
first of all as a long time student of the titanic disaster and member of several titanic clubs i feel entitled to comment on the film i don t really care how many awards and accolades the film won but to me it is still an absolutely awful film cameron had the resources to make a proper semi documentary film of the disaster but unfortunately chose to turn it into a po faced romantic mush the fact that so many people around the world fell for it only shows to my mind the sad state of taste and common sense that movie critics and audiences have these days whoever said that all movies should have a hero and heroine falling in love in fact most real events are anything but romantic and the titanic disaster certainly was not one i feel that it needed a better script and director with a semi documentary approach and as little artistic license as possible i almost threw up in the last sequence where the dead lovers meet among the other lost passengers and crew who break out in applause is this an intelligent film ask yourself
this movie is worth watching if you enjoy marvelling over special effects there are some interesting visuals aside from that it s typical nineties aughties hollywood fare of dazzle without substance true to the title it s not worth picking apart the story that s like performing brain surgery on a dinosaur there s not much there to begin with it s nothing original and not very special so don t go in for the story at all just look at the effects as has been mentioned it got a little flashy at the end diluting the purity of great fx treatment of an invisible and at times half invisible man however if you ignore the standard pyrotechnics it s a sight to behold or not to behold all in all it s a decent fx film worth seeing for that purpose and that alone
this movie is incomprehendably bad it begins with several random explosions and then cuts to a sock puppet of a t rex that talks to the audience it goes back and forth between sock puppetry and animation throughout probably because the film makers couldn t afford live actors i ll spare you the long tiresome relentless plot that drags this pitiful film on for a brutal minutes one of my friends found this very rare video at a hobby shop somewhere that sells out of print b movies and he bought it for the sole purpose of making fun of it but as it turns out our intervention was not neecessary this film makes fun of itself better than we could i thought that ed wood s plan from outer space was the cheesiest movie in existence but leave it to japanamation lego cars sock puppets to outdo him if you see this movie anywhere buy it without hesitation it is very rare and worth many many good laughs
let s be honest here the only reason anyone bought this the only reason anyone reviewed this and the only reason anyone could possibly claim to enjoy this is because david lynch made it and because you want to have david lynch s children but guess what even david lynch can produce a piece of crap maybe lynch wanted you to transcend normality and experience absurdity in itself as a pure subject of knowing maybe the atrocious cacophonist sounds and chicken scratch visuals are supposed to imply something about humanity s place in the world about our relation to the real about the absurdity of it all instead it just says one thing to me i just lost if i wanted offensive for the sake of offensive i could crank hansen on high and let me ears bleed if i wanted absurd for the sake of absurd i could just take a dump on a plate and watch that for minutes there is a single redeeming quality to dumbland it is meta meta funny that is it is so bad that it isn t even funny because it s so bad this fact however is a little funny if you hate yourself and hate your money then buy dumbland if not spare yourself the agony
i may have seen worse films than this but i if i have i don t remember or possibly blocked them out who knows if i was to undergo hypnotherapy i may remember them along maybe with been abducted by aliens as a child or other traumas if so i would happily exchange those memories for the ones i have of watching this film i should give the film some credit it did produce an emotional response i actually started to become angry at scenes that spoofed other films and tv programs that this travesty was dirtying them by association i am terrified that i may be unable to watch films like dr strangelove again without this film flitting across my minds eye
this film is just plain horrible john ritter doing pratt falls of the actors delivering their lines as if they were reading them from cue cards poor editing horrible sound mixing dialogue is tough to pick up in places over the background noise and a plot that really goes nowhere i didn t think i d ever say this but dorothy stratten is not the worst actress in this film there are at least others that suck more patti hansen delivers her lines with the passion of ben stein i started to wonder if she wasn t dead inside even bogdanovich s kids are awful the oldest one is definitely reading her lines from a cue card this movie is seriously horrible there s a reason bogdanovich couldn t get another project until years later please don t watch it if you see it in your television listings cancel your cable if a friend suggests it to you reconsider your friendship if your spouse wants to watch it you re better off finding another soulmate i d rather gouge my eyes out with lawn darts than sit through this piece of garbage again if i could sum this film up in one word that word would be suckotrocity
one of the worst romantic comedies nay worst movies i ve ever seen boy who works as a phone psychic must pretend to be gay to move into apartment with woman of his dreams hilarity does not ensue boredom light gay bashing and horrible dialogue do if you read brad meltzer and like his crappy dialogue you ll like this movie be smart avoid this if you see it destroy the copy
i ve rented and watched this movie for the st time on dvd without reading any reviews about it so after minutes of watching i ve noticed that something is wrong with this movie it s terrible i mean in the trailers it looked scary and serious i think that eli roth mr director thought that if all the characters in this film were stupid the movie would be funny so stupid it s funny wrong he should watch and learn from better horror comedies such as fright night the lost boys and the return of the living dead those are funny cabin fever is the reason why i registered to www imdb com so i can release my thoughts of discontent about it i ve decided to watch the movie a second time aaargh and make notes for my partial review to show how foolish the movie is resident evil horror or dude where s my car comedy i can watch over and over again and still enjoy but this how bad can a script and a director be this bad here are the awful scenes in chronological order in the early scenes we see henry who doesn t realize his dog lying on the ground with its tongue hanging out of its mouth and dead glazed stare is dead the movie doesn t explain anything about the blonde long haired kid who like to bite people and my answer to marcy s unanswered question what s wrong with the woods is nothing the script has that bearded guy warn them about the woods just for suspense then the smartest of the pack bert almost gives us an example of how to start a forest fire he meets now infected henry who begs for help and from here on the movie wants to break the record in using the f word bert starts to freak out because henry looks awfully ill bert don t make me shoot you he forgets to add with my bb gun bert heads back to the cabin but how about that he meets marcy and jeff who were having sex but now suddenly decide to go out for a walk marcy wisely takes out the unguarded campfire bert had started earlier a moment of clarity for a change bert doesn t mention a word about henry because the fool thinks he has killed him with his bb gun later as the five estupidos sit around their campfire another weirdo shows up with his dog maybe that s what the warning about the woods is all about it s filled with weirdos and their dogs they let him sit with them only because he has a huge bag filled with cannabis their brains are completely intoxicated no wonder why they are all so dumb this is the last time we ll see this forgettable character alive henry shows up at their cabin note he was lying all the time a few yards from their cabin looking worse almost like a zombie covered in goo he says he needs a doctor but the young einsteins refuse to help the poor sucker he gets into their unlocked truck which of course also has its key in the ignition henry almost seems smart enough to drive the hell away from there but instead starts puking blood all over the dashboard seats and windows the fantastic five come out running armed with a bb gun a knife a baseball bat huh ever tried playing baseball in the middle of the woods a poker and a insecticide spray can ready to combat the single unarmed and terribly sick man clever script bert manages to kill the car with one single shot of his bb gun which is only possible in the mind of director eli roth what else am i supposed to do bert yells in his defense jeff and paul try to knock henry down with their bat and poker but miss and crash the truck s windows instead henry walks up to the dumb girls who say he s coming towards us thanks for the info dumb broads i can see that but i don t think he wants to do you any harm marcy sprays in his eyes making henry yelp and our hero paul touches henry s arm with a burning log from the campfire which they recklessly left burning while they were inside the cabin where has all that wisdom gone i guess the cannabis had started to take its toll henry turns into the human torch and runs away screaming the following day bert and jeff head out for a mechanic and marcy decides to go for help all by herself in the woods as paul stays behind with karen doesn t that sound idiotic marcy could have stayed with karen and paul because jeff and bert were already going for help i skip my comments now to how we suddenly see marcy in a canoe rowing over a huge and winding river how did she get a canoe does she even know where she s going anyway she goes to the riverbank and finds a very big and seemingly abandoned cabin and like in most horror movies walks inside the cabin saying hello is anyone there bert suddenly pops up from behind a furniture and scares her and me at first and along comes jeff as well how did they get here did they swim across the river do you see how brainless the script is deputy winston meets paul at the cabin he somehow doesn t notice the blood on their truck this happens around minutes of viewing and i have decided to stop torturing myself anymore and popped the dvd out before i take my own eyes out now that s funny if you liked this movie do yourself a favor and watch fright night the lost boys or the return of the living dead then you ll see they are more entertaining than this thing even the toxic avenger part which is also a lousy film is way more funnier than cabin fever
such a long awaited movie but it has disappointed me and my friends who had gone to see the movie on the first day from the trailers it looked like a action movie but it turned out to be a out out comedy a bad comedy but one thing that deserves appreciation is the acting by these professional actors they ve done their part of the movie very well good acting but i don t think that can save the movie india has been shot beautifully kerala rajasthan ladakh were all saturated with color alright nevertheless the way the intrinsic beauty of these places was shot made me want to find out exactly where those places were and when i could go there action sequences were shot very shabbily no one could make out head tail of the stunts they ve used akki akshay kumar very well but could ve been done much much better animation is the worst i ve seen in recent movies s movies had better animation scenes i guess initial scene where the car is falling off flying should be better word the road into lake and the movies name has been mentioned nearly every to mins just to make sure audiences don t forget the movie name i guess
the brothers quay are directors judging by conventional thought should have stuck to making short films i myself actually really liked their first feature institute benjamenta but judging by their sophomore effort the piano tuner of earthquakes i m willing to agree they don t come close to equaling their past genius at feature length piano tuner is without a doubt a gorgeous film to look at and often to listen to unfortunately it s borderline painful to sit through with its convoluted narrative and glacial pace reading the plot synopsis it sounds like a pretty good story but the brothers fail miserably to bring it to life one thing they should consider avoiding completely in the future dialogue my god it s awful here a huge bust
i wondered why john wood was not playing dr falken until i watched the film bad plot bad science bad acting and overall a bad film please don t watch this film rent the original war games if you are feeling nostalgic i didn t like the bending of the plot to beat the terrorist threat idea either in the first film w o p r was built because russia had s of warheads pointed at the u s a in this film the idea behind the computer was to kill terrorist in training before they are a threat politics aside one of the good thing about the first film was the highlighting that even a stupid computer could grasp the idea of the pointlessness of war in the end no such insight is offered in this film
this was an atrocious waste of my time no plot the acting was so far below par it should be used as an exemplar in acting classes of what not to do it is merely a commercial rip off of the earlier universal soldier which also scrapes the bottom of the acting barrel its sad that vd needs to assert his ego every few years and sadder still that people will pay good money to sit thru it this kind of schlock gives martial arts movies a bad name by comparison it makes segall norris and arnold look almost talented perhaps vd should take the leslie nielson track and do send ups of his genre at least then we could be laughing with him instead of at him
oh it s the movie i thought i waited too long to take out the dog i can t believe i watched the whole thing i guess i was optimistically anticipating that it was going to get better horribly disjointed dialog pathetic acting and totally improbable events like toby s mom hanging herself in the time it takes col to walk upstairs and back down in a room with a ceiling and no chairs counters or anything around her motionlessly suspended body that she could have possibly used to climb on to do herself in the little girl that played the daughter of the last family was the best actor in the whole movie and the puppy of the first couple was a close second the basic storyline has potential and with a good script and director could be a seriously creepy flick but this version sadly is not it i get more scared when i open my electric bill every month
what you were not aware that scooby doo battled zombies well you might also not be aware of this little film that was directed by victor halperin who had also directed white zombie four years earlier that would probably make it the second zombie film made no don t go looking for dorothy stone to expose her breasts as you would expect in most zombie films and don t even look for any brains being eaten this is you know so what you will see is typical of the period lots of talking you do get to see dean jagger twelve o clock high and bela lugosi s eyes but that is about it zombies in cambodia indeed
watching a videotaped replay of about various spider man cartoons made me realize why i couldn t stomach it when it first came out i m from the old school where the spider man cartoon was the best and still remains the best i won t get into the psychedelic version which is terrible give me traditional villains please the acting in the new stuff is lousy read off a sheet with either no feeling or overacting paul soles where are you now this guy was the best at voice acting for spider man no one comes close watching secret wars a great idea for a cartoon mini series made me wince dr doom sounds like a comedy version of bela lugosi in a scene with red skull and doc ock red skull has no german accent while ock is heavy russian the old marvel comic hero series from had much better voice acting iron man sounded like he was wearing an iron mask captain america sounded authoritative not like some teenage kid paul frees as the thing in the s was the best thing ever the old voice actors were pioneers and there will never be anyone like them ever hear mel blanc s son no way can he replicate his dad the animation is clunky okay so they have all the fancy character shadings and nicely painted backrounds sometimes you can say more with less movement if more movement looks bad sometimes when you let the computer take over the movements they become robotic i really don t think any of these animators know what in betweeners are the stories are badly written and some of the lines they give the heroes are horrible why for example when heroes are teamed together for the first time they start fighting with each other in secret wars it was a lame excuse that got them in disagreement i can see if the hero was dark unknown and mysterious like the punisher but why the thing and iron man can t hold their tempers with each other is ridiculous then the torch joins in this is just another of the later comic trends to get heroes to square off at each other for a few seconds because everyone wants to see that stuff give them a better reason to fight and maybe it can be pulled off but hey what are you doing here and you don t tell me what to do are lame reasons another badly written scene is in the wedding where harry osborne unmasks himself to spoil peter s wedding that whole scenario was awful last but certainly not least is what another critic calls juvenile violence meaning no punches at all in secret wars the lizard carefully ducked the thing s charge but the thing punches the bad guys across an entire block in the comics he must simply revert to lifting heavy things and subduing a bad guy by grabbing hold of him in the cartoons sure these cartoons were not made strictly for us adults but for kids under that s why they can t have punching because mommy and daddy don t believe in that type of violence but you can blow things up these cartoons will include that as a kid before political correctness came in fashion i saw cartoons punching each other what s wrong with a punch to the chops is there really less violence in the world today because those slick and crafty new cartoons took out the punch i find this the most insulting of all when i watch the new stuff they ve written out the punch because we could all hurt ourselves kids enjoy these cartoons all you want i ve seen enough rating
so i rented this from netflix because somebody gave me roger ebert s book i hated hated hated this movie and he gave this one a rare zero star rating in the book and said at the end of his original review mad dog time should be cut up to provide free ukulele picks for the poor so i figured from ebert saying that i would see if it was really as bad as he said it was i know most society says not to listen to critics and to judge for yourself but i could not express how much i hated this piece of junk like ebert did and never since ebert s review of rob reiner s north where he said he hated that movie ten times had i ever heard such a brilliant hatred movie review here we have richard dreyfuss as a gangster which i don t think it would be terrible to see dreyfuss as a gangster if the screenplay for this movie were written well but above all the other things that were awful about this movie i can certainly tell you the script was not written well at all while the movie starts off with jeff goldblum saying that he enjoyed watching dreyfuss s girlfriend while dreyfuss was at a criminal hospital the movie starts off with some decent dialog after the opening credits but after that first or minutes the other minutes just consists of dumb characters talking pointless garbage for seconds then someone gets shot then there are a whole bunch of jokes about dreyfuss being mentally ill haha not funny then we get an unpleasant and unfunny scene parodying frank sinatra s my way sang by gabriel byrne apparently to insult dreyfuss of course because the screenplay was written on the level of a sixth grader dreyfuss shoots byrne over five times and byrne just will not die are we as the audience supposed to even care or find that mildly funny i can certainly tell you i did not care or find that funny not only am i disappointed in dreyfuss who i admire much as an actor for producing and starring in this tripe but i am also extremely disappointed in jeff goldblum because this was released the same year that independence day was the top grossing film of the year and ultimately one of the most successful films in history did goldblum feel that independence day would be a flop and then just take the next role that was offered to him to make some money if independence day were a bomb what did an oscar winner and the star of two of the biggest money making films in history find remotely enjoyable about this the opening sequence of mad dog time says that the movie is set on another planet i only wish now that i have wasted minutes watching this trash that it would have stayed and opened in theaters on the planet where it supposedly takes place so that way everyone on this planet would never here of this ridiculous waste of minutes out of my life that i will never get back ebert saying the movie should have been cut up is not good enough i am afraid every copy of mad dog time should have gasoline poured all over it and be lit on fire i have yet to top a worst movie i have ever seen because this one has won it s honor as the worst movie ever
rosario dawson stars as a girl who is date raped and then begins a decent into darkness until given a chance at revenge while its clear why dawson took the role its a chance to show her acting chops and to make a small independent decidedly un hollywood film its also clear that aside from stunning good looks dawson seems out of place in the role forgive me i simply couldn t find her thats not a mistake thats how i felt i had no idea where she was yes i know she s on the screen but even though i spent the better part of two hours looking at her she left no impression on me whats so ever i blame the script for this since other than the ending not a whole heck of a lot that happened on screen seemed to make any real sense the people seemed to be more posture than real and what happens didn t seem to fit together forgive me for being vague but nothing in this film other than the end which i would love to talk about but can t cause it would spoil it and the image of rosario dawson as nothing more than an image stayed with me what can i say this may click with you it may not for me it s time i can t get back for rosario dawson fans only though be warned there s several real reasons why this is nc and rosario please you re a better actress pick better scripts
this movie is horrible if you pay attention to it it s a perfect movie if you just watch the colorful images dance across the screen each one with no apparent connection to the next i rented this movie because i m a david bowie fan and i really appreciate musicals in finality bowie was in the film for a total of ten minutes and the songs and dance sequences were sparse and left something to be desired the moral of the story was really befuddling i couldn t tell if it was about racial issues in london in the s or about not selling out for the first half of the movie i was chuckling at how cheesy it was but i liked the campiness of the no selling out message when blacks started being murdered i thought my tape had gotten messed up maybe i rented half of two different movies nope there was a keep britain white song and dance sequence i m sorry but wwii is not something you can write a musical about at least not a musical that could conceivably be described as campy as i have several times in this review overall i d say this movie could do a whole lot better if it made up its mind and cast better actors and put david bowie in it for longer goddammit my grade c
while the overall idea of escape from atlantis was intriguing i found the film to be far less than what i had hoped for upon reading the plot summery perhaps i am too much of a child in the technological age the movie was made as it is now an official five years ago after viewing fantasy epics such as lord of the rings and science fiction feats like star wars as a whole it could not compare to other movies of similar line such as dinotopia or homer s the odyssey my beef basically is that i couldn t relate i am just about the same age of the children a young adult and have no trouble putting myself in the place of a middle aged man if that is the character available but the picture did not take me to a different mental plain of existence i didn t find myself saying ack i would have done the same thing it did not open the doors to my imagination even without comparing it to high budget films or other tv movies standing alone certain aspects of the feature i found to be cliche the character development in the children occurred too rapidly for my liking seeing too much of the stereotypical selfish teenager bitter after divorce image changing into the we re a big happy family let s never separate again feel that can ultimately make or break a picture in the long run even the characters themselves could have undergone improvement a typical set of one or the other stereotypes there was the ever present selfish beauty looking to be rebellious accompanied by mr perfect image of combining athletics good looks and intelligence yet a brooding attitude and lastly the smart aleck little brother we find to be so common these days while i know the personalities pushed the story along i think that adding more individuality as far as nuances and more unique differences would have made it a more enjoyable and believable as far as character movie i do have to raise my glass to the costume and set design that made it worth finishing to the end for me don t get me wrong all movies are worth seeing for yourself and the opinion of one could never account for the opinion of many but i think that with a little more depth to the script and a little more i cannot believe i am saying this realness i dare say escape from atlantis could have been magical
i saw this movie last weekend and it is silly and mindless an ancient curse turns a man into a mummy in his pajamas the victims are scared senseless and can not run from a slow moving old man they drop their torches and shiver instead of attempting to ward him off or duh burn him quentin alias mr fabersham of the honeymooners is married to diane brewster alias miss canfield of leave it to beaver fame who is unhappy in marriage wow love plot the rest of the cast just follows each other in the tombs and wait for screams to react and run to their aid the egyptian girl is not bad looking but does not lend much to the film where is the mummy really just a curse unleashed this does not hold a torch to universal mummy films in the least watch this movie if you need sleep because you will dose off
is a film about a club with that very title in the setting of the s era it features the classic good looking bartender the sexy females the high powered owner the partying when all entwined together chaos ensues and the bartender played by phillipe seems to be at the brunt of it all i m going to be as blunt and honest as possible whilst avoiding any outright unfair or untrue comments like it s an ok film i really do find it a completely dire film complimented by it s dire cast every time i sit down to watch a film casting salma hayek i am always awaiting to see her beauty radiantly expressed simultaneously with a great performance but reality invariably reminds me quite abruptly how utterly talentless she is i mean really what has she ever bequeathed the masses with other than her immense table dance in from dusk till dawn the same goes for ryan phillippe another poor actor who gives nothing to the screen but his good looks and insanely dull facade otherwise known as acting mike myers isn t quite as bad as these he does at least give the film something worthy playing the seedy extroverted co founder of the club the type that the majority watching would hate i e job well done he puts in a somewhat convincing performance that gave me rare enjoyment from the flick but alas it is not enough to rescue the film from it s baseless and flat nothingness most bad bad films i find something to take from the film but this has nothing to it really neve campbell isn t too bad but she is just there the storyline is dull it appears the writer was more bent on making a film of this style and embellishment and forgot to add anything else any meaning any class anything at all because like most ornaments they are just hollow pointless objects that are merely pretty to look at much akin to the basis of this disastrous film genuinely an hour and a half of time i could have spent better doing something much more exciting like talking to year old relatives on the phone about the weather
the egyptian movies has a lot of filmes with high level of drama or romance or comedy or action even sports ziab la ta kohl al lam was banned in egypt because it content nudity full frontal female nudity and this kind of nudity is prohibited in the egyptian movies when i saw this movies i felt down fool story nude actress bad action some horror awful colors dear friend if you wanna see a great egyptian movie simply stay away form ziab la ta kohl al lam we have great movies in egypt we have a great actors who won a global wins like omar el sheriff or gameel rateb we have great directors like yousef shahin so believe me pall you don t need to see this movie
this movie is so awful it is hard to find the right words to describe it at first the story is so ridiculous a narrow minded human can write a better plot the actors are boring and untalented perhaps they were compelled to play in this cheesy film the camera receptions of the national forest are the only good in this whole movie i should feel ashame because i paid for this lousy picture hopefully nobody makes a sequel or make a similar film with such a worse storyline
this movie is really bad the acting is plain awful except michael ironside i don t get the story richard grieco is the only survivor after a fight between two mc gangs he comes to a town and suddenly he is choosened to fight against the bad people who wants indian land at the cover it said he was a indian himself that returned too his home town i didn t hear that in the movie if so it wasn t clear richard grieco was one hell of a bad actor stiff and ugly he said his lines like it too and we wouldn t talk about sean young she hasn been any of my favourite actors but in this movie she plays a indian women who falls in love with bolt grieco she is awful when i rented it i choosed between this and subterfuge with amanda pays i choosed this one because of michael ironside was in the cast maybe i should have taken subterfuge don t see this unless you think richard grieco looks tough on a motorbike with sunglasses i will soon uptade the cast list because i have it at home i wrote it down after i seen the movie
as a fan of science fiction movies i have been aware of the matrix since its release in from the little bit i would allow people to tell me about it i assumed it was highly original and sophisticated i am also a devotee of alice in wonderland i could never quite figure out how i missed the matrix when it was released with the imminent release of the matrix reloaded it was time to buy the dvd and watch it the disappointment was too great the premise of the matrix the controlling device as opposed to the movie was clever the philosophical premise of parallel worlds alternate realities is shopworn however i could still have bought into the film as science fiction if it stayed firmly in that genre unfortunately it turned into a standard will they or won t they escape break through rescue those in need of rescue etc to make matters worse it turned out to be another martial arts exercise the problem is that science fiction and martial arts films are really two different types to the purest the devotee of one or the other mixing the two doesn t work it is like mixing science fiction with romance you can have one or the other but not both in the same film or at least not both to the same extent in the same movie if there were such problems with the matrix the matrix reloaded really compounded the problems at least thirty minutes of the film were either martial arts sequences or the protracted car chase this observation ignores the question made in every professional negative review of the movie if neo could do the superman thing why bother to fight at all the answer of course is that s what draws the young male demographic group into the theatre then there is the redemption through love aspect that plot device was worn out by richard wagner over a hundred years ago it was actually handled better by him in die gotterdammerung so where does that leave those who saw the matrix reloaded martial arts fans probably groaned through the trite but arcane sci fi philosophizing science fictions fans were wondering why they were sitting through a kung fun fest most of the males in the audience where probably bored by the silly romance aspect of the film just what are you supposed to be getting for your bucks when you see the matrix franchise films science fiction martial arts or soap opera a bit of each does not make for a whole lot more of any of them nor for a satisfying film for the afficionados of each
well it was funny in spots this film is a or maybe a its a film that sits on the video shelf and gathers dust rent this one after you seen everything else beats boredom but not by that much my wife like like this film better then i do maybe its not that bad
this is a very cheaply made werewolf flick the video is dark and poorly lit the audio is uneven and poorly recorded and mixed the script is cliche ridden junk with the usual characters like the tough detective who shoots werewolves with his silver handgun filled of course with silver bullets the acting is as wooden as the characters the fx are non existent lots of extreme close ups of werewolf jaws and biting the only thing that is shown is lots of soft core t a instead of dropping for this tripe check out a really great recent werewolf pic dog soldiers with sean pertwee
but thomas ian griffith just doesn t have the polish that a big bucks actor has granted this was made years ago some of the humorous lines could have been timed to make this not only action but comedy and how do you get kc out of katia koslovska anyhow plummer s character was so corny he would have fit better in a bullwinkle toon personally if action flicks are going to show skin i d have liked to have seen equal time between female male otherwise don t show any
back in my days as an usher private lessons played at the plex i was working it was a sleeper hit selling out friday and saturday nights for several weeks i never got around to seeing it but saw that it was on cable this last weekend so i decided to give it a shot what i witnessed for the next minutes was one of the worst movies i have ever seen and one that made me terribly uncomfortable to watch the basic story is a teenage boy lusts after his sexy maid sylvia kristel she too seems to feel an attraction towards the boy but for more sinister reasons so we get scenes of the boy watching her undress and her inviting him in to watch and it goes from there eric brown as the teenage boy has to be one of the worst actors i have ever seen his scared reactions to every time sylvia takes off a piece of clothing or when she touches him are horrible i didn t laugh a single time during this piece of junk and let s not get started on the subplot of the maid and chauffeur planning to extort money from the kid let s just say it involves faking a death burying a body i could go on and on but it gets more ridiculous the sex scenes are the worst i have ever seen even though eric brown was older then he looked the fact is he looks like a baby it appears he has no idea how to kiss a woman if that was acting then maybe i should re think my criticisms of brown and it just came too close to bordering on child pornography to be erotic i have never been so turned off by a sex scene even though miss kristel is quite beautiful with and without clothes spoiler warning i must make mention of the last scene to me it s just plain sick but i can remember audiences cheering as the film freeze framed and dissolved into credits our hero returns to school and begins a flirtation with one of the female teachers he asks her out for dinner and she gives him a look as if tom cruise has just asked her out she nods affirmatively and he walks away smiling at the camera in triumph give me a break yes i am sure teachers all over would just risk everything for a plain looking teenage kid i will never understand the appeal this film had in certainly it was more then the nudity because there were plenty of teen sex comedies with nudity that bombed at the box office and to think that these same teenagers that cheered that movie years ago are now working their way up corporate ladders and possibly helping to run this country that is a scary thought
i used to be an avid viewer until i personally spent long cold hours helping build a home for the white family only to be sickened to see the house a year later all of the beautiful rock landscaping has been removed the gorgeous rock sidewalk and front fountain have been removed all the pine trees and pecan trees in the front have been cut down sprinkler system has been ripped out it now looks like a disaster area they don t even live there any more they live in town and come out only for the weekend it sickens me to think of all the hours that the great people of oklahoma donated to these people and to see the result the story that we all saw on tv wasn t completely the truth don t believe every thing you see and hear
the fallen ones falls under the waste of life wol category i am sad that i am now two hours older was not entertained my other family members also watched this movie and threw demeaning comments at the screen and rooted for the mummy i felt sorry for the actors wagner i have read other negative reviews and cannot add anything else to this movie other than it could be reduced to minutes so it could take a minute slot on tv without any loss of plot it reminds me of a dish that has several good ingredients but when served is bland with no flavor at all in my humble opinion the foot mummy should have been feet and improved the plot by taking out the mystic and replacing him with several people who want to denigh the facts and want dna samples for evil reasons the heroes are discredited and tossed on there ear by their colleges later after everything was screwed up by the evil people the heroes would save the day and prove everyone wrong
standard procedure for swedish movies today seem to be to start by throwing plausibility out the window and continue down that path for the rest of the process r narna is another fine example of a movie making very little sense banks in stockholm are being robbed by a highly efficient military styled gang of robbers two police officers start investigating the case that soon becomes more complicated than it would appear at first as usual in swedish film the cast is mostly made up of the same people you have seen over and over again mikael persbrandt must be in every swedish film from the last few years but that s ok i guess since persbrandt is one of few that performs solidly here like he usually does the problems with this film mostly revolves around the story itself first of all the robberies feel mostly like background rather this is more a movie about a young policewoman fighting to prove herself in a male world like that has not been made a thousand times before with a decent actress instead of sofia helin also there is a completely unbelievable plot twist near the end that seems about as plausible as aliens landing but still i did think it was a quite nice touch considering i was half asleep right about then it spiced things up a bit and actually saved the rating from dropping another step in the end the main problem is the same thing as with most other swedish movies of this kind simply that the action and suspense doesn t live up to the standards we are used to from other movies of this kind mostly hollywood it feels cheap and rather weak in comparison in my opinion swedish filmmakers should try to focus more on plot and acting and forget about trying to make hollywood action light like they do now because this becomes yet another forgettable effort from the swedish movie industry i rate it
i cannot for the life of me explain what the popularity of the children s television show power rangers is all about i never understood why unsuspecting children liked this show in the first place since the characters seem so idiotic and not worth caring about whatsoever the costumes look completely atrocious like multi colored spandex that people wear to go to the gym what exactly is the purpose of this show anyways but for kids to learn how to fight to solve their problems what is up with the awful hair cuts and clothing on this show anyway not to mention this show is still playing on cable television just to make money to teach kids how to fight each other when they disagree on a certain problem there s far better entertainment for today s children hopefully they aren t as gullible as kids of the s who watched this show oh and what is up with the homo erotic tension between the red and green rangers anyway
the direction struck me as poor man s ingemar bergman the inaudible dialogue was annoying the somber stoicism that all characters except banderas showed made me think they were drugged i think the director ruined it for me
i am very tolerant of really bad sci fi and horror movies i ve been watching them since i was or so i ve seen some really bad stuff but i deal with it i ve even watched a lot of scifi channel movies so i know not to expect much a usually promising movie that has no ending to speak of hope springs eternal i guess or the triumph of hope over experience as they say unfortunately this is a dog right from the beginning and i knew it but like a moth to the flame i kept thinking something anything interesting would happen it doesn t all of the actors give a decent performance given the script i don t know how they all kept straight faces it has something to do with collagen starved worm parasite creatures who are slowly taking over the human race one body at a time there s an evil plastic surgeon who collaborates with the enemy by giving them the outward appearance of humans don t worry he gets what s coming to him the slug people themselves don t really know where they came from they think they might have thumbed a ride on a meteor that landed on earth but somehow they know about the members of slug royalty among them the slug princess has managed to breed with a human being who knows that she s the worm queen and loves her for her self oh must i go on please i implore you do not waste hours of your life watching this anything would be better think of the worst least enjoyable way you can spend two hours it would be better than this
i can barely find the words to express how utterly utterly awful this film is i was sold on the promise of action with segal and stealth aircraft which normally make for an entertaining action movie i can honestly say i d rather gouge my eyes out with a cocktail stick than have to see this film again the acting was so awful that it was almost funny the story was insanely weak with plot holes so cavernously wide you could fly an f through them the script was so poor if i found out that a year old wrote it i shouldn t be in the least surprised the direction and production is so amateur i wouldn t even hire these people to shoot my worst enemies wedding video utter utter drivel those responsible for making this movie have cheapened the art and they should be ashamed of themselves steven segal should never ever show his face in public again i can t imagine what made him agree to star in this the worst film i have seen in my entire life
sure it had some of the makings of a good film the storyline is good if a bit bland and the acting was good enough though i didn t understand why olivia d abo had such a pronounced australian accent if her character was supposed to have been raised in the us my biggest problem however was with the wardrobe i know as rule the average american is considered a frumpy dresser by any self respecting european but this was beyond that anna s colour combinations were positively ghastly and that potato sack like sad excuse for a coat she wore throughout the film made me break out in hives i suppose the idea was to be as realistic as possible how many school teachers walk around in prada but simple doesn t mean an absolute lack of taste a word to the wise
i honestly had somewhat high expectations when i first began to watch this movie but it turned out to be probably one of the most boring films i have ever seen first of all the pace is incredibly slow so it seems much longer than it is and it s not short i m sure when jane austen wrote the book she made it several pages long filled it with description and didn t intend for people to read in in one day or it might drag and lose it s appeal which emma most certainly did now sense and sensibility had this flaw of a slow pace but at least it had lively lines to make up for it as well as some good performances that brings me to flaw which is of course the acting while i don t happen to care for basically anybody involved in this film i am sure they are capable of good work but i didn t see much of it in this movie it was like people were trying too hard to be witty too hard to be upper class too hard to be british well some of them so they all just came off as a bunch of actors and not as people the cast as i said seemed only like actors and not actually like the people they were playing maybe that s a good thing because the people they played really weren t all that nice why did everybody like emma for example sure she was nice to the rich handsome people in front of them but she was an awful gossip behind their backs if her friends were ugly then she didn t even bother to go behind their backs so why is this girl so great why do people have to tell stories just to make her laugh of course the snob couldn t even do that right i have enough problems with gwyneth paltrow as gwyneth paltrow and her emma did not exactly change my opinion well it s easy to see that i did not care for this one i m sure it s a lovely book and all but some books are really not meant to be made for the big screen and emma is one of them
redline is a knockoff of fast furious without any of the redeeming qualities it doesn t need to have a convoluted plot with multiple twists and surprises but it needs something this is the equivalent of a porn film where the storyline and dialogue consist of seconds at the beginning and the same at the end except that this is worse because you don t get your money s worth mind numbingly boring impossible race sequences and a terrible waste of expensive beautiful cars which almost acquire negative points for having appeared in this movie sure she s hot but who s that desperate for an on screen female i feel like the director sat there with a hat full of dialogue and plot snippets and shook an ball every time they switched scenes no serious person who races or knows anything about it would watch this movie and enjoy the race scenes
this review may contain some spoilers just when you thought they didn t make them so extremely bad anymore along comes rae dawn chong as a space vixen and willie nelson as a native american witchdoctor it s even worse when you factor in that these two are the better aspects of starlight a film that should only be viewed for laughs chong is an alien sent to earth to seek out the only remaining half breed part man and part alien apparently the earth is in dire straits something is wrong with the genetics of mankind and in a few decades the world will be turned into a polluted wasteland only by duplicating the dna of the half breed can the kindly alien race save the planet don t ask me how that is since the movie gives the impression that the world will be destroyed by pollution which is caused by humans you would think earth could only be saved by getting rid of the polluting creatures not saving them anyway the half breed turns out to be billy wirth a man living in a small southwestern town and is part native american from his mother s line despite the fact that his mother is a red headed caucasian and his grandfather is willie nelson wasn t this the sort of malarkey that made the bombastic carmen electra bomb the chosen one such a howler chong arrives in her ship just as wirth nearly drowns after driving his motorcycle into a lake in a fit of recklessness being the result of just breaking up with his girlfriend before you can say utter the word hogwash chong is revealing her secret to wirth who isn t surprised for a moment and spreading the word to wirth s family chong also makes pals with wirth s mother who seems to have lost a few of her marbles over the years well this is because wirth s father was an alien that abandoned her of course he is the standard rogue alien that has conveniently picked this moment to come to earth for wirth so he can use wirth s dna to make the people of earth his slaves huh his laughable attempts to use his telepathic powers and capture wirth suck up most of the screen time and are the worst scenes in the movie not only are they boring but they are the scenes where you will be spotting the flubs the most the ideas might be nice on paper but they are handled here with the utmost of stupidity particularly in the aforementioned scenes with the rogue alien but the effects are the bane of the movie the opening scene involves chong on her spaceship communicating with her superior someone who we do not see but that chong communicates with through a vat that emits pink light they use no spoken words but telepathy so we are treated to subtitles trouble is both chong and her superior s subtitles both look alike and the director gives you no indication as to which of the two are actually speaking at any given moment which makes the whole conversation nothing but gibberish the spaceship is the worst effect to come out of hollywood this side of an ed wood film now i am usually lenient on effects when dealing with a low budgeted film such as this but these effects really got to me the most offensive was the most simple one a fake night sky the stars in the sky are so phony they almost sound off a dial tone most notably are the moments where chong tells someone she comes from pleiades and we get a shot of the seven stars thing is the seven stars take up about half the night sky in the movie but any stargazer knows that pleiades is a star cluster between the constellations perseus and taurus and the cluster doesn t take up much room in the sky at all these effects just get so lousy that your jaw will hang lower and lower with every passing moment be careful for it will go right through the floor during the finale when the effects have willie nelson turn into a human spotlight and oh it has to be seen to be believed starlight star bright last star i see tonight i wish i might i wish i may not have to watch any more of this trash today zantara s score out of
disappearance is about a couple who take their family on vacation in new mexico and find themselves in deep trouble after taking a detour off the main highway to visit a town that was seemingly abandoned in for unknown reasons the town of weaver seems harmless at first and has tourist appeal until the family is stranded there overnight and they begin to have good reason to suspect that others have experienced their same predicament with fatal outcomes the henleys watch a blair witch project esquire video diary left by the town s last victim which ironically demonstrates the best performance of anyone in this movie although hamlin and dey s performances are much better than the supporting casts their emotional affect seems flat to me throughout the movie disappearance has appeal for most of the movie as there is much suspense and good direction however the plot takes unexpected and implausible turns that seemingly make no sense worse yet it that there really is no understanding of what exactly is going on in the movie which makes the bizarre ending less tolerable it appeared to me that the movie makers were so focused on making a stream of suspenseful scenes that they threw away all the elements of good story making plot development gradual explanation of themes and symbols that lead to a cohesive solution outcome the most difficult aspect of the movie for me was that the first three quarter of it was spent building up tension and curiosity about certain aspects of the plot that were then suddenly disposed of as if we didn t deserve an explanation what was the significance of the indian symbols on the walls what happened to the original people of weaver what was the connection with the people at the dinner what did the sheriff know what did the missing boy discover if anything this was i believe a bad move since it engendered some resentment i had invested quite a bit of brainpower into hypothesizing some plausible explanations for some of these plot turns and strange events only to have the movie makers simply end it without giving an answer to any of these things these are some nice cliffhangers for the ending of a miniseries that is about to pickup again next week but a totally frustrating and inappropriate ending for a stand alone movie
i am a big fan of old horror movies and since i am middle aged old to me is a movie made before with most being made in the s to s period i am not a big fan of more modern horror movies with one exception being creepshow which i thought was great i could reminisce about the stories there but i really really enjoyed the monster in the box story with hal holbrook and also the one about the really clean guy was a great ending all the stories were great though so why did i like them so much the characters had some decent development the lines were very plain about who was good and who was bad the horror bits were heightened with a close up of a face aghast with fear and the funny bits were really funny this sequel is either greatly lacking of these elements or they are totally absent i am writing this only having watched it partially because the movie was a complete waste of time and i turned it off to do other things like write movie reviews on imdb com lol when george kennedy and an old dorothy lamoure get top billing it s telling you something of also romero s expertise is hard to find here they must had told him to tone it down to a pg standard i don t know what this was rated at but it looks pg to me and that s not a good thing for a movie with nothing else going on it s shown on the encore cable channel if your dieing yuck yuck to see it
this is your typical priyadarshan movie a bunch of loony characters out on some silly mission his signature climax has the entire cast of the film coming together and fighting each other in some crazy moshpit over hidden money whether it is a winning lottery ticket in malamaal weekly black money in hera pheri kodokoo in phir hera pheri etc etc the director is becoming ridiculously predictable don t get me wrong as clich d and preposterous his movies may be i usually end up enjoying the comedy however in most his previous movies there has actually been some good humor hungama and hera pheri being noteworthy ones now the hilarity of his films is fading as he is using the same formula over and over again songs are good tanushree datta looks awesome rajpal yadav is irritating and tusshar is not a whole lot better kunal khemu is ok and sharman joshi is the best
greetings again from the darkness what ever happened to the great barry levinson he directed two of my all time favorites in avalon and diner he had some fine movies as well rainman but always provided something of interest until now i believe the worst thing you can ever say about a comedy is that it is boring envy is the definition of boring never of big fan of pure slap stick dumb and dumber i was just stunned at how god awful this movie is there are maybe chuckles in the whole thing if you can pay attention that long the best part of the film is the running gag of the title song by a redbone sound alike if the film had been written as well as the song it would have been tolerable rachel weisz is a wonderful actress and i realize they all want to do comedy even julianne moore but the real world exposes one weaknesses snl cast member amy poehler is her usual over the top in her role as trailer park trash turned princess the disaster of the film is jack black and ben stiller the first work commute together flashes some promise but after that their chemistry disappears due to the poor script this script is like most of jack black s character s ideas not a bad thought but no hope for success
i have heard about this novel a long time ago many of my friends have recommend me to read it i searched it in every place and finally found it this is a book that every man should read because it is genius and because of it s vision i enjoyed every page i knew about the movie and could not wait to see it when i finally did i was very disappointed many things that are in the book are not in the movie i do not think that this is a spoiler that just makes the movie not logical michael radford might be a good director but a bad writer especially as a book adopter the movie is not dark at all the writing is really bad the only thing that is good even great is the acting john hurt is an amazing actor and the only face i myself could see as winston smith what angers me the most are the people in imdb that called this the best adaptation ever without even reading the book or knowing anything about screen writing you can only understand the brilliance of the story by reading the book do not consider this as an alternative as a fan of the book i was very disappointed the points i gave for this movie goes for the acting
the major flaw with the film is its uninspired script it plods back and forth between vignettes of bettie s story and re creations of the klaw short films while the klaw re creations are well done it is unnecessary to recreate them in their near entirety page richards while not an amazing actress does a decent job overall and at times she does bear a remarkable resemblance to bettie also of note is some faithful attention to detail costumes and clothing well done as is some of the set direction the sets are generally sparse and feel stage y but do feel of the era it is sometimes surprisingly well lit and the color palette was clearly thought out to give the overall look a vibrant retro feel
i was never so bored in my life hours of pretentious self obsessed heroin addicted basket cases lounging around whining about their problems it s like watching lizards molt even the sex scenes will induce a serious case of narcolepsy if you have insomnia rent this
this film is terrible the story concerns a woman trying to find out what has happened to her sister the film struggles with its identity lurching from noir thriller to erotic with elements of horror thrown in for good measure the film has a very confused structure for example with frequent use of flashbacks without tying these into the story the plot is poorly developed and the characterisation made it difficult to distinguish between who was who and the part they were playing some implausibilities exist in many films but the scene where the main protagonist willingly accompanies a virtual stranger to his home then agrees to go upstairs alone to where he says she will find a phone minus the gun she had brought with her to call the police was too hard to believe some of the cinematography is very poor we were watching on a tv so how anyone with a smaller set could work out what was happening in the scenes taken in almost complete darkness is beyond me overall a chaotic mess
celia johnson is good as the nurse michael hordern is good as capulet though it s his usual neighing and whinnying and not a patch on his king lear john o conor reads the verse well as friar laurence though he never takes it anywhere alan rickman is good as tybalt in the first of his yuk roles that would make him famous christopher strauli s benvolio is sympathetic the sets are pretty if not stunning as in some of the other bbc shakespeare s and that s it the rest is weak to dreadful rebecca saire turned during production and hasn t a clue about how to act juliet she opens her eyes real wide and whines every line in exactly the same way patrick ryecart is poorly matched to her and his self regard is inexplicable the balcony scene flows smoothly and uneventfully with zero emotional or erotic impact their deaths come as a relief if i had a dagger i would have offered it to them hours earlier anthony andrews is unspeakable as mercutio a great shock if you remember his fine work in brideshead revisited he breaks the mirror of shakespeare s verse into a thousand shards of two or three words each and then shouts the fragments in as disconnected and unintelligible manner as possible in this production queen mab abdicates awful the director alvin rakoff shows only an intermittent gift of putting the camera where it will show us what we want to see the opening brawl is notably incoherent however there is humor when in a later fight romeo apparently knees tybalt right in the cobblers tybalt then grabs the offended region however did that get through r j is a long play this version is not recommended for classroom use or much else
i didn t know it was possible to release a movie this bad the labeling sounded so promising but you would think that with a cast of at least one of them would be able to act my wife left me and went to bed after the first minutes she made a wise decision
spoilers the unfunny radio quiz show host kyser and his mediocre band are the excuse for lugosi karloff and lorre to pick up a paycheck in this bland sporatically watchable haunted house spoof lugosi is a mystic whose seances are exposed as a fraudulent attempt to bilk an heiress fortune karloff is the butler and lorre is a professor who exposes fake mediums but it turns out that they re both in conspiracy with lugosi of course kay kyser and his band of something year old kids uncover the truth with the minimum of possible humor along the way not recommended to any but the absolute horror completist
complete waste of time this movie is not comedy it s not drama it s not romance not even teenage comedy at least story it should be some turn over one end but it s so disappointing when movie has a turn over on end i expect that turn over to make movie even better exp fight club but this turn over makes movie even worse when i watch teenage comedy and i don t do that very often i expect lousy jokes and bunch of nudeness jokes are too lousy and there is no nudity you got only one very good looking i must admit girl and that s that and she s fully dressed whole movie acting is bad like soap series don t waste your time there are porns with better story and acting sorry on my bad english
my mother keeps a cassette of this film as a general threat to any film loving person who annoys her everything about it stinks as such it is a true classic who gave it were you inadvertently watching a good film and accidentally voted for this one everyone involved in the movie making process should be forced to watch at least a small section of this film it should be an indelible stain on the minds on all that hold film sacred and be revered as the tide mark of the cinematically dire
and i never thought a movie deserved to be awarded a but this one is honestly the worst movie i ve ever watched my wife picked it up because of the cast but the storyline right since the dvd box seemed quite predictable it is not a mystery nor a juvenile catching film it does not include any sensuality if that s what the title could remotely have suggest any of you this is just a total no no don t waste your time or money unless you feel like watching a bunch of youngsters in a as grown up kind of gothic setting where a killer is going after them nothing new nothing interesting nothing worth watching max makowski makes the worst of nick stahl
the ladies man is a funny movie there s not much thought behind it but what do you expect from an snl movie it s actually better than most snl movies i e superstar or a night at the roxbury tim meadows and will ferrell were both very funny chris parnell was also funny in his short scene one of the funnier ones in the movie other than that the rest of the cast is average and is just there to support meadows i ve definitely seen funnier movies but i ve seen dumber ones too again it s not exactly a deep movie but it s good for a few laughs it was funnier as a skit though but still if you re looking for a pretty funny movie i d recommend this one just don t think about it too much or you ll hate it rating
i gave this movie a and though i consider myself a science fiction fan i found this movie very difficult to take seriously it was on amc one late night and i m glad i saw it for free this movie is probably good for a few laughs but not much more the special effects are about average for the time period not awful but not great either of course we know more about mars now than we did back then but we really can t hold that against this film the main reason i did not like this movie is because of the story there were several parts of this movie that i wish would have been explored in a little more detail the astronaut s injury condition the city on mars the creature in the lake etc overall the movie is much like a lengthy episode of the s version of the outer limits complete with a cheesy ending
this film is easily one of the worst ones i have ever seen and i don t mean that in a good way we wanted to see a crappy horror thriller so we picked the one that seemed to be the lousiest in the store for once the film was everything we d expected and more or should i say less the actors look like they are reading their lines from posters behind the camera the so called special effects are created by putting red see through plastic in front of the camera to give the impression that we are seeing through the eyes of the killer rats and the script don t even get me started on the script and just when you thought it couldn t get any worse it turns out that the first part of the film was oscar material compared to the ending take it from me this film is hilarious if you re into crappy horror films but if you want a good film keep on looking this is not for you
i ll say one thing about this film there are no lulls you can t get bored watching this the problem is that it is too intense there is too much action and it needs lulls that is the risk you take in modern action films you want it interesting but not overdone this is way overdone even though the acting is fine and features a couple of names in gary busey and roy scheider it still has the feel of a b film the best part of it is scheider s dialog the only a part of this b film the rest of the story is strictly rambo mentality but did have a few standout scenes one in particular was a very innovative scene featuring land mines that was memorable not enough of the other scenes were to make this a keeper for long
i have read all of the love come softly books knowing full well that movies can not use all aspects of the book but generally they at least have the main point of the book i was highly disappointed in this movie the only thing that they have in this movie that is in the book is that missy s father comes to visit although in the book both parents come that is all the story line was so twisted and far fetch and yes sad from the book that i just couldn t enjoy it even if i didn t read the book it was too sad i do know that pioneer life was rough but the whole movie was a downer the rating is for having the same family orientation of the film that makes them great
how can a movie with amy posey and raechel have nothing funny in it believe it or not house bunny did this better and funnier hopefully the principals had a good holiday and got some money this movie is an embarrassment to all of them it is a clich from beginning to end clich s can work well with a script or at least an idea this movie does nothing but use clich after clich rather than ideas or script it uses the preexisting persona s of the actresses rather than develop characters bad sad and rubbish now i apparently have to have ten lines of text for a comment really why as an it ops manager this is another example of sloppy coding
this short spoof can be found on elite s millennium edition dvd of night of the living dead good thing to as i would have never went even a tad out of my way to see it replacing zombies with bread sounds just like silly harmless fun on paper in execution it s a different matter this short didn t even elicit a chuckle from me i really never thought i d say this but night of the day of the dawn of the son of the bride of the return of the revenge of the terror of the attack of the evil mutant alien flesh eating hellbound zombified living dead part in shocking d was a very better parody and not nearly as lame or boring my grade f
this one is bad a really bad and boring crime movie that has nothing out of the ordinary in it a series of crimes the killer that you do not see throughout the whole movie the classic investigations and also the classic tale about a cop who figures out what s going on and isn t believed by anyone so he has to fight by himself to reveal the truth not too much in this one vote out of
this seemed an odd combination of withnail and i with a room with a view sometimes it worked other times it did not tragedy that they changed the name for the us release though keep the apidistra flying is much better than the nothing title a merry war acting was okay script was okay overall it was a mediocre film
i was seriously looking forward to seeing this film because it seemed truly promising from the coming attractions jim carrey with godlike powers was an idea that most definitely worked for me as a huge fan i was sure he d be supremely in his element with such a promising premise and what could go wrong yesterday my bubble got burst big time boys and girls because i saw the movie the first act where it s set up that he hates his life he s a disgruntled employee and a majorly unhappy camper with an ax to grind against god is serviceable the second act where he s summoned by god via telephone and receives powers almighty is great carrey gets to have fun with his new toys and it s a pleasure to watch really funny but the third act is wretched beyond belief the rot starts setting in after the dinner scene between bruce and his girlfriend grace jennifer aniston who comes off exceedingly well in this movie considering her part is merely a plot device even her name reeks of unsubtlety she thinks he s gonna pop the question but instead he tells her on bended knee yet that he s finally getting his news anchor job and isn t it so exciting she doesn t think so she wants him to marry her see so she winds up leaving him see even though she still loves him very much see and the rest of the film is spent banging us over the head with one pathetic beyond heavy handed spiritual sounding cliche after the next until by the end i was praying too for it to be over i didn t mind the lack of subtlety in the first two acts one example in the nd act after he gets his powers bruce prances into the room singing what if god were one of us just a slob like one of us blah blah blah and i was even willing to overlook the amazing amount of contradictions being hurled at us for openers morgan freeman a k a god tells bruce he can t violate anyone s free will but he does this a lot those choices were forgivable this is a jim carrey comedy directed by tom shadyac it aint the remains of the day or rather it was supposed to be a comedy when the script writers lose track of that in the dreaded act and try to turn the proceedings into some sort of gag message movie what we get instead is hell on earth bruce realizes the error of his selfish ways he realizes that grace is his saving have to say it grace and that his priorities in life had been severely misconstrued all this could have been conveyed in a far less heavy handed way however the film didn t have to go into the dumper to make these points unfortunately the writers and shadyac apparently had no idea how to resolve the story in any sort of clever light handed way so they went the bang em over the heads route in hopes that we wouldn t notice they even tacked some surprisingly unfunny out takes at the end in the further hope that this would lessen the bad taste it didn t work for me
it s often said that tobe hooper just struck lucky with his grisly horror film the texas chain saw massacre and every time i see another hooper film that view is only reinforced it would seem that hooper wanted to make his own version of films such as scanners and firestarter in and so we end up with spontaneous combustion a film with a couple of good ideas and a whole load more that are borrowed from other films put it all together and you get a messy boring film that most people would do well to miss the film leads the audience to believe that it might be half decent initially with an intriguing back story that focuses on some experiments carried out on two young people in the fifties the couple have a child and shortly thereafter burn to death as a result of the experiments done on them fast forward some years and the baby is now an adult named sam but naturally he s not a normal person and soon finds when it s discovered that he has the ability to set things on fire at will the film stars brad dourif who must have seemed like a good casting choice given his success with child s play two years earlier but actually was an uninspired decision as the central performance is really terrible and not helped by the terrible supporting performances the turgid direction and dull script also don t do the film many favours and the trend of lacking in favours is continued by the special effects which are very unrealistic and have nothing on the films that this one is ripping off all of which were made some years earlier the plot is really slow and it s almost an hour before anything of note happens and i didn t care for it even then it soon becomes obvious which direction the film will go in and it all boils down to the sort of tedious ending you would expect the final confrontation is a big disappointment and nothing is really explained during the film not that any revelation would have been interesting anyway overall this is a rubbish film and another reason why tobe hooper is a long way from being a great horror director see firestarter again instead
before i watched this film i read a review here stating that this film could possibly be one of the best films ever ha ha scene by scene the tension grows alright from the annoying characters in this movie from the little girl talking gibberish and trying to drown the little boy to the killer just running about without any notice and who was the guy at the beach talking to the little boy things just seem to happen and then go unanswered in this film as i watched it seemed like the film was going in one direction then just doesn t go anywhere but into a new direction and on and on the acting is great but the writing is horrible each character in each scene says or does something so unbelievable unrealistic and the reactions of the fellow cast extras are simply strange there are no resolutions to the problems developed throughout the film making it confusing and ultimately a big waste of time
yes this movie is bad what s worse is that it takes no advantage whatsoever of its own title in the entire movie zombies and vampires fight each other once or twice on top of that we re never really sure if the main character in the movie is definitely a vampire one might argue they were trying to tone it down or make it realistic but it ends up just boring more than half of this movie takes place in a car the scenes that take place anywhere else aren t much to brag about either also there s no clear antagonist and in the end you have no idea what really happened for the last minutes of the movie however i will say that for a film this low in production value the soundtrack was surprisingly appropriate and instrumented with either an origonal score or sampled music from elsewhere i m all for independent films but it doesn t look like this was ever intended for a mass audience if any worse than scarecrow slayer
saw this on tv i m glad i didn t go to the cinema to see this or spend the money on rental the movie is totally predictable from the corrupt owner and planner to the snaking electric cables the plot is really weak and unbelievable the avalanche expert guy gets hit by a foot wave of bone breaking avalanche using actual footage and all he has to do is get up and shake himself down the avalanche thunders down at a million miles an hour and stops dead at the side of the road some of the actual avalanche material is impressive and shows its devastating power but the contract between the real avalanche and the staged stuff makes this film look even flimsier do yourself a favour don t bother with this one not even on t v
whatever happened to british tv drama from john major through tony blair the focus of the genre appears to have shifted from social realism to smugly normative women focused tales about the piddling domestic problems of nice middle class professionals or perhaps tvnz doesn t buy the good stuff please let that be what it is the writer s long career in soaps probably explains why the dialogue is made up mostly of stale clich s niamh cusack s performance is strong on meaningful looks each held by the director for at least half a dozen beats longer than they deserve baleful looks however are a poor substitute for depth of character if the writer has failed to provide such material for actors to work with of course this is theoretically a thriller about a murder investigation but that s not as important as the central character s failing marriage and its attendant problems is cusack s character s husband a complete bastard will her son be utterly traumatized by the marriage break up making these the central issues isn t a sign of insight it indicates a profoundly narcissistic identification by the writer and director with a character who should be getting on with her job lynda la plante knows how to write this stuff so that it feels as if it matters and involves viewers other than housebound neurotics evidently paula milne isn t up to the task
ok aside from the psychedelic background imagery the info presented here was good the music i could have done without not that it was bad music just that it didn t fit this film at all as for the content of the film the director brings up the often lacking pagan perspective on christ s existence and a startling comparison of the deeds and events of christ s life vs the lives of mythological figures deities such as mithra and dionyses then he brings up the chronology of christianity s origins and presents an ok case but not one that blew me away if the director had stuck with the facts and continued on with them this film would have been good however at this point in the film it disintegrates into a group of personally gratifying attacks on mel gibson s passion of the christ and a christian private school which the director attended in his youth during an interview with his old principal which during the course of it comes to light that the director set up under false pretenses i felt that the director was acting sort of childish he was asking good questions but like the film itself the interview crumbled into an attack on this particular private school s rules not christianity all in all if you re just interested in some info watch the first minutes or so and then shut it off
i shudder to think what people must have thought of environmentalists after viewing this piece of overbearing preachy cinematic trash larded with enough indian wannabe nuttery and space brother buffoonery to stock a new age shop starlight makes anyone who gives a damn about the planet look like a feather wearing crystal fondling idiot the plot alien rae dawn chong arrives to guide a flute playing underwear model in a mystical quest to avert earth s impending environmental collapse but first they must defeat an evil alien who looks nothing so much like a refugee from a castro street bar fortunately they ve got mystical grandpa willie nelson along to help who looks faintly embarrassed by the proceedings as well he ought to be along with buckets of cheap f x and reams of pointlessly swelling music sure the clunky script helps to obscure the film s trite plot and staggering pace but that s just the tip of this melting movie iceberg everyone concerned with this film should have their union cards revoked until they complete a real course in environmental science
right up until the end the bad guys have the upper hand always which kind of put into question the competence of the good guys a couple of innocent man accused of a crime plots are irritating some unnecessary dialogue in which various dull legal issues get debated this is just a mediocre dumb old western so what s this nonsense about trying to keep things realistic cagney s atypical presence in a western is one of the few if not the only entertaining thing about the movie somewhere around the middle there is a ridiculously timed marriage proposal sort of like where is the kid hiding where is he oh and by the way will you marry me
this movie was pretty absurd there was a few funny parts its goes right in to the bin of movies in my memory where i think hmm that movie had a few funny parts but overall pretty ridiculous plot or lack of i thought it seemed like ben was trying a little too hard to be a cooky funny guy and i didn t understand how he was a self made multi millionaire and still such an idiot anyways i like ben affleck he makes some crap but hey i can forgive him i mean i liked jersey girl i didn t think gigli was all his fault i like him overall i guess he s kinda like the kid you feel sorry for cuz he just can t seem to get it right my advice would be to avoid this flick it didn t really develop in to a workable plot and catherine o hara and jimmy g weren t used as well as they could have been they deserved better overall this movie is not home alone it s not a christmas story its not christmas vacation or any of the other classics forever forgettable
i think everyone was quite disappointed with this sci fi flick for one thing it was directed by tim burton another thing it s a remake of what is supposed to be a classic i found it boring gross and ridiculous if you ve seen it you know what i mean just about everyone at imdb say it s crap and boy are they right if you haven t avoid it it s a snorer out of
this film was so bad i had to fast forward most of it to get to the good bits hah what good bits the only bit that was worth it was the ending those who have seen the film will know what i mean i expected a lot from this film like a underworld meets dawn of the dead meets freddy vs jason but what i got was this crap story was forgettable the cast was used badly and what was the director thinking when he made this this could have been a great but i turned out to be the most boring film i have ever watched ok so what if there was a nice bit of t and a i was after the gore and i was bitterly disappointed don t expect a film thats good but if you want a bad cheesy horror then by all means watch this and see how a horror movie shouldn t be done
gwoemul the host due to pollution in the han river a mutated beast goes on the rampage the youngest member of the park family is snatched by the beast and it is up to the rest of her family to find her before she becomes the beast s latest meal firstly i love monster movies mutated bears over sized alligators packs of ravening komodo dragons the whole lot creature features are my favourite kind of horror film so i really wanted to like the host but it wasn t to be there were three major problems with it the first can be seen with a quick look at it s imdb pagegenre action comedy drama fantasy horror sci fi thrillertoo many damned genres it took itself too seriously to be a comedy and yet was too light hearted to have any real message though it did seem to be trying to make some kind of statement anti pollution anti american or anti government the drama was misplaced and mixed in a confusing mish mash with all the other styles secondly after the initial monster attack nothing happens for almost the entire film the central family wander about looking for one of their own while the governments of korea and america apparently do nothing and that s it they just wander about occasionally hitting one another presumably for a bit of comedy relief this lack of action made my attention wander and apparently it did the same for the director as whole plot threads go unresolved a mystery plague invented by the evil americans is completely forgotten about and is never resolved and lastly the film is clumsily political it paints the americans as being stupid and evil but gives us no american characters with any more depth than a cartoon villain the opening scene has the most obvious stupid american vs wise korean moment with a korean morgue assistant asking his boss the coroner not to pour chemicals into the han river the american coroner all but cackles maniacally as he orders the assistant to carry on as well as being racist it s lazy film making and there is no excuse for that on the plus side the monster is good kind of a mix of the relic and deep rising some of the movement effects are quite cool and the initial monster chase through the park is a lot of fun there are also some nice shots in the film some of which remind me strangely of the way firefly was filmed shuddering cameras out of focus shots etc there is also a nice scene at the end where the hero and a little boy he has saved are sitting in the family s mobile food stall it s night time and snow is falling the street lamp is giving out a cold light but the food stall has a warm glow coming from it overall i was really disappointed by this film i d been looking forward to a decent creature flick and instead i get some pseudo political horror comedy lite looking at the comments on imdb i can t help but think that if this had been a us production it would have been slated just cause it s a foreign flick doesn t mean it s any good there have been some great movies out of korea in recent years the vengeance trilogy and brotherhood for example but this certainly isn t one of them for once i m in favour of a remake tighten up the directing improve the scripting and this could have been a nice film as it is it s not worth a couple of hours of anyone s time
i think jason lee has huge potential but this was the wrong vehicle in which to attempt to break out as a star the plot is awful the comedy is awful i laughed twice i think for relief because in retrospect they were fairly lame jokes i found myself scared for the future of fletch and had to console myself that it was the film that was flawed not lee julia stiles and selma blair are hot but i recommend looking at the still photos on this website to figure that out instead of this film save your time star
this is quite possibly the most retarded s slasher ever realized but how can you be harsh on a film that features non stop images of dozens of gorgeous ladies with exhilarating bodies doing aerobic exercises taking showers and wandering about in tight gym outfits prior to being a horror film aerobicide is a minutes promo video to encourage the use of steroids silicons and other body stimulating fitness products if you d leave out all the footage of hunky boys lifting weights and yummy girls wiggling their butts and racks to insufferable s tunes there probably only have about minutes of story left plenty of time to improvise a plot about a sadist killer slaughtering young health freaks with a big safety pin yeah the film opens with an unintentionally hilarious scene of a girl getting fried between an electric sun bathing device several years later people turn up dead in the same spa you don t really need to be an experienced horror fanatic or a rocket scientist to figure out there s a link between the murders and the burning incident now do you investigating the case are a seemingly braindead police officer and charles napier look alike and a beefcake private detective who gets lucky with the bustiest s beauty i ve ever seen looking through the credits her name s dianne copeland apparently and she didn t do anything else apart from this turkey and an imbecile troma movie called surf nazis must die what a wasted opportunity she may not have been a great actress but she sure had two other big advantages that would help her move upwards in show business the amount of gore and the quality of the make up effects are nothing special neither we re treated to a couple of bizarre stabbings with a pin and some barbecued human flesh the plot twists near the end are ridiculous and predictable but by that time nobody is taking the film seriously anymore anyway aerobicide a k a killer workout is recommended in case you want to switch of all your brain functions off for one night but nevertheless feel like watching a film it actually would make a terrific double feature with death spa both films have a lot of sexy and scarcely dressed babes and both films are pretty dumb
plot melissa is a new girl in town she s fifteen years old and her birthday is coming up in one week since melissa is beautiful every boy in town wants to hook up with her but the few that manage to catch her interest mysteriously die to be honest the real reason i wanted to watch this film is because dana kimmel of friday the th pt was in it which isn t a proper reason why to rush out and see a movie when i started watching it i realized that sweet sixteen isn t a very good slasher it s really dull and boring and just doesn t go anywhere after over an hour only three murders have occurred and the story hasn t really developed in any possible way the movie is nicely shot with quite nice photography and good directing but just as with many other slasher flicks from the s the movie suffers from being too dark at times the acting is actually pretty good though and melissa s character is easy to sympathize with even though she s a complete slut the story line isn t completely rubbish but it s just way too dull to keep you interested the only things that kept me interested was melissa she was stunning and dana kimmel whose really sweet and cute in this movie all in all pretty dull slasher flick that doesn t go anywhere i d definitely wouldn t recommend it to slasher fans
those familiar with the two previous cube films pretty much know what they can expect a small group of people trapped inside a bunch of booby trapped rooms paranoia bad acting this one is a bit different though roughly half of the film takes place outside the cube where we get to watch the people watching the people inside the cube or at least five of them i guess cube zero aspires to explain what the deal with the cube is but you really don t get to know much more than what was covered in the two first films sure there s sort of an explanation in there but it feels pretty lame compared to what was suggested in the first film cube zero looks rather cheap as did its predecessors and the fact that it shows more than just a couple of empty rooms only emphasizes this feeling i also fell pretty confident in saying that there s no risk that any of the actors will win any awards in the foreseeable future they have brought back the traps from cube though by that i mean that they re almost the same ones which is a bit of a shame i know that many people kind of appreciate this film and its ties with the first one but i just feel that it s a completely unnecessary contribution to a franchise that wasn t that great to begin with
okay i m not going to critique this film in depth i note the many elogious reviews in advance of me and as i generally like maria de medeiros i have been long hesitant to make a disparaging comment and in such fashion nearly a year has passed but each time i see that dvd on my shelf i sense an inner groan anyway let the elogious voices override me but for other cinephiles like me beware expressed in simplest and gentlest terms here s my stance the political turmoil and overthrow providing the backdrop for this film also served as a backdrop for a certain period of my life via newspapers i read daily in my local middle european pub at that time i followed the newsreports but never fully grasped what the heck was transpiring the reporters tended to report either in non partisan terms or with a conservatism which frowned upon any groups disturbing the peace or fomenting rebellion against the establishment those were times when other winds of unrest swirled through paris berlin prague and various places in the u s all of whose issues i understand clearly at the time but dictatorship or not my papers tended to treat the govermentment of portugal simply as the establishment not as a well fleshed out evil empire to use flippant star war terms so week after week i read of disturbances but never found an intelligent editorial that might provide the history behind them or evaluate the practices and social economic impacts of the dictatorship etc so in purchasing this film i had at least two hopes to finally understand the details leading up to the social unrest and to enjoy a well conceived drama this film gave me neither the film presupposes that viewers already have ample knowledge and deep emotions regarding the historical facts and the drama well as i said i want to encourage maria de medeiros and the portugues film industry but it was trite and shallow i obtained my copy of the dvd from france selection official cannes un certain regard the box shows smiling clean shaven actors the lead giving the victory sign in a fashion that reminds me more of the playboy bunny after seeing the work i wondered what the french could have thought of it though as a shallow piece of cinema verite with sensitive ethnic content i can understand their natural inclination to praise it for its honesty but look at the back of the box un regard chaleuruex sur la revolution a warm regard try describing allende s overthrown and murder with a a warm regard try it with czechoslovakia in try it with the whole line up of overthrows and civil rebellions another review maria de medeiros a renoue avec son pays son enfance et son histoire rubbish rubbish rubbish at least for me i love portugal in all of europe lisbon barcelona and prague are my favorite cities but my love for a city and a country doesn t flesh out a vacuous film i ll hang on to my ancient vhs tapes of capas negras and a cancao de lisboa meanwhile i m stuck with a zone by the above title that might as well go in the trash
i suppose that any novel that s as much of a downer as moby dick would not find much favor with depression era audiences who had enough of their own troubles but any resemblance to the classic herman melville novel is a pure coincidence in fact half of the film is a prequel to the main story as we know it not that too much of it was kept for the film we first meet ahab creely he s got a last name and a brother as one happy go lucky soul with two legs and intentions to marry joan bennett who is father mapple s daughter that brother derek played by lloyd hughes also wants to marry bennett john barrymore is ahab in an over the top performance barrymore had not quite mastered the sound cinema and he gave out with all the silent era histrionics plus a stage voice that would have shaken the rafters of any movie theater this film was playing in we see ahab lose his leg to the great whale moby dick and i have to say the amputation scene was pretty gruesome of course this was all before the code still i m sure audiences shuddered after that the story of ahab s hunt for the whale that he thinks made him unsightly in joan bennett s eyes that is not exactly melville s motivation in fact there are no women characters in moby dick as he wrote it one of the things melville did was invest the crew of ahab s ship the pequod with personalities other than queequeg the cannibal harpooner the names are there but not the personalities starbuck and stubbs might as well be smith and jones i d see this version of moby dick strictly for curiosity and nothing else
for a fan series i must admit that hidden frontier is not at all that bad but reviewing this series can not be based on whether it is a fan series or not the initiative in itself is commendable the creativity as well i reckon these are people with ordinary jobs and a big enthusiastic heart for star trek but doing all this work pulling all these resources taking all this time and still all those flaws first of all the acting and the lines are awful for most the dialogs belongs in a s military show not in star trek the captain mr squinty looks like he is about to burst into laughter anytime and most characters are just reading their lines the directors should be aware of the fact that retake is not just a word in the dictionary but i also guess that the series are made in the manner of two takes frakes who directed many of the tng episodes and movies also i could not help but think that most of the actors are typical trekkies without going any deeper into that assumption my biggest concern regarding the whole project is the quality of the releases when they first decided to spend so much time and resources on this series why didn t they make it available in decent quality using the quick time format with low low resolution is a waste of talent even the higres episodes is considered bad quality compared to the standard quality series are released in using xvid codec with a larger resolution and file size would have improved the experience massively if band with problems was the issue setting up a torrent tracker would have solved that let s hope the crew decides to brush the series up and perhaps release it on dvd giving it the quality the project deserves
this was the worst movie i have ever seen and i ve seen a lot of bad movies first of i m from kansas this movie does not have a shred of truth in it at all its like they took btk name and made up the rest on top of that it looks like someone was like i ve only got bucks here take it and make a movie and oh yeah don t worry about researching btk at all just make up something seriously pure dookie no one should ever see this movie the slaughtering cows scenes and making his victims eat stuff and describing animal slaughter btk did none of these things but the movie does so for the love of god never see this god awful movie the made for tv ones are way better and way more accurate
as someone who lived through and still remembers that decade vividly if the actual s had been half this funny and semi normal they would have been so much more enjoyable actual kids in that era did not act or behave anything close to as bright eyed and normal as these kids did the country s youth was still under the influence of the hippies and the drug culture all that s rebellion that it spawned especially in the behavior department the petulance the smugness the self righteousness the childishness the unreasonableness of them none of the characters exhibit any of that someone compared to happy days and i can see why they were both sitcoms that take place years before the current time they were broadcast and they both offer only surface cliched depictions of the actual eras not even close to the full scope of it just showing the obvious things the fashions toys music contraptions etc and that s it for those too young to remember or weren t born then trust me the s weren t like that any more than happy days were like the actual s as m a s h didn t accurately portray life at a us army medical base during the korean war etc
spoilers contained i d heard from various sources that this film was controversial and that the ending in particular was horrific what i didn t expect was the complete change in tack with about twenty minutes to go what starts off as a typical cowboy indian western suddenly descends into a very dull romantic comedy about honus soldier blue of the title played by peter strauss and cresta candice bergen who escape an onslaught of the cavalry by the cheyenne the majority of the film then focuses on these two mismatched people hence the romantic comedy bit donald pleasance then turns up and abducts them both for no real apparent reason they then escape and both turn up separately at the cavalry base on the eve of an attack on the cheyenne base as cresta used to be married to one of the cheyenne chiefs she escapes the cavalry base and joins up with them so far so ordinary then comes the ending after enduring well over an hour of poor acting involving a cliched will they won t they get together storyline the movie then transforms into over the top exploitation involving among other things a decapitation and a child being shot in the back of the head similarities can be drawn with the wild bunch at this point of the film but the wild bunch kept the same tone throughout and didn t resort to extreme gratuitous violence in some ways soldier blue reminds me of frank perry s last summer which also completely changed tack for a shock ending i didn t hate soldier blue nor find the ending particularly disturbing but just found it to be pretty dull with an unnecessarily violent ending if you want to see a film with a truly disturbing slaughter of the innocents i would recommend elem klimov s come and see
ok so mr agrama s company which is involved in some dubious business with former italian pm silvio berlusconi produced a horrendous mish mash by a mr carl macek what is this horrendous mish mash i m talking about well macek took three entirely unrelated japanese sci fi animated series namely macross southern cross and mospeada added tons of dialogue believing firmly that the american audience is too dumb to understand the narrative and artistic virtue of silence edited the whole lot heavily for violent content added some metaphysical mumbo jumbo dubbed it using some of the worst voice actors this side of acting hell reba west s singing was and still is unbearable and a total outrage especially compared to mrs mari iijima and the result was an episode series with hundreds of continuity problems and plot holes of course the mecha were cool to look at especially those in the macross saga and the plot parts that remained unscathed were good but whatever was good about robotech was not the result of macek s work or the voice talents he recruited it was because of the toils and efforts of the uncredited why would i be too bold to accuse hg of plagiarism here japanese creators those of us who eventually got wind of the real deal and compared the originals to robotech now wish we had never been exposed to robotech the originals are so much better naturally and make a lot more sense robotech however did something worthwhile it prompted legendary anime creator leiji matsumoto to start a campaign for the protection of japanese anime creators intellectual property from such unauthorized and uncalled for reworkings that talentless people like carl macek produce
this film is so much of a rip off of the masterpeice demons and thats the only thing that makes the movie worth watching the acting is terrible the action scenes are speeded up the script is almost painful and budget non existent if you think this film is good then you havn t seen a real horror film skip this and get a copy of the movie demons
green street as it was called in the uk or hooligans is a bad film the story is full of fantastical ideas and premises that anyone who lives in england has been to a football match or knows the first thing about football will spot immediately my first main gripe with hooligans is the poor casting of the two main characters don t get me wrong i like elijah wood and have a great respect for his work but despite his best efforts he struggled to pull off this role the main motivation for his character is anger at the system and anger at betrayal however he spends much of the film placid and cheery only displaying his pent up aggression in one brief scene towards the end of the film this linked with his looks and physique make him a thoroughly unconvincing addition to a gang of football hooligans at no point during the film was i convinced that a he could handle himself in a fight against such thugs and b the firm of thugs would accept such a person into their fold the other main character is played by charlie hunnam charlie looks the part and is fairly convincing as a thug unfortunately being a native of newcastle upon tyne in the north of england he demonstrates the worst east london accent since dick van dyke tried to go cock en y in marry poppins details such as this probably will not bother an american audience who will be less attuned to regional dialect in the uk but being from the uk it was a problem i couldn t ignore and it contributed to ruining the movie for me the supporting cast all gave convincing performances and were well cast especially the role of bover the lad playing this character would have been much more suited to the main role that charlie played with a film like this you have to convince the audience that your characters are plausible unfortunately the casting failed imagine if you made a film like the godfather and had sean hayes jack from will and grace playing michael corleone s part you would not be convinced the story in hooligan is also full in implausibilities i am no football hooligan but i am a fantatical football fan i know how cliquey a group of regular football supporters can be as such it deem it impossible for a non football fan who is not a fan of the club in question is not from the area in question and not even of english nationality to be embraced by a firm who equate to a secret organisation in some severe cases my final and biggest problem with this film is the way it portrays football hooligans i take objection to the film s idea that despite being very violent individuals hooligans are excused as they live by some sort of code of ethics in their own world and should be admired for being brave and loyal to each other this is complete rubbish football hooligans are complete scum they take football the national sport of england and use it as an excuse to terrorise frighten and intimidate people they only represent a tiny percentage of football fans but give the whole game and people of this country a bad reputation they are not brave or loyal they are cowardly and evil if the gse in this film truly loved their club west ham why would the devote their lives to being a stain on its name hooligans are an embarrassment to football and to english society football hooligans do for the reputation of football what hitler did to the reputation of germans although this film tries intends to show the gritty side of football violence it does nothing more than promote it as some kind of excusable activity for extreme fans of the sport it does not show the poor innocent by standers at football matches who have their day ruined by some idiot throwing coins lighters glass into the crowd it does not show the innocent home and property owners who have to put up with graffiti and broken windows it does not show the real fans of football clubs who suffer indignity and embarrassment when their teams supporters are banned from travelling to away matches or abroad to european games because the thugs among them ruin it for everyone if you want to see a good film about football violence watch the bbc drama the firm
this film had such promise what a great idea an underdog paintball team struggling for recognition and personal glory only to lose it s speed due to bad dialoge poor editing and a half written story the characters in the beginning were interesting only to lose steam half way through to become one dimensional people sputtering out tired one liners maybe if they spent some more time on the story and dialoge it would have been a great movie instead of a almost afterthought effort
i normally have no problem walking away from a bad movie however this was an unique case this movie was so bad that i actually sat through the whole thing almost praying it would have one minute of good movie time to justify the hour and a half that was wasted needless to say i was brutally disappointed set at a beach house where a group of college friends are celebrating vacation this movie suffers from numerous problems making it not worth seeing first there are gaping plot holes second very few of the c list i don t even dare call them b actors can act worth a damn so any scenes that have potential fail miserably third the rate of the film is very choppy and awkward to watch most of the time making suspense building very difficult leading to very few surprises for the audience fourth and most importantly the ending is completely anti climatic partially because of how it ends setting who the killer turns out to be and partially because the dialog is just atrocious to the films credit it is the only movie that i will ever say is the worst movie i have ever scene and i ve seen a lot so just like a bad joke you would have been all the happier never hearing the next time someone asks you if you want to know a secret you will be yelling no you really don t as you run in the opposite direction
having seen the first ten episodes i must say this show sucks what bothers me the most is that the show was shot in canada i know it s cheaper but they should have shot it in california so we could have had scenes in the desert that would have been more true to the movie the first scene where they are outside in another world is in the mountains with lots of pinetrees where it looks cold that does nt feel very egyptian what worked so well in the movie was that it felt like you were in the ancient egypt here it feels like they re running around fighting aliens in a canadian forrest and it s so lame that appaerantly on other planets the fall comes as well you can see leaves on the ground in the forrests that all look like forrests outside vancouver it just makes the show even more unbelievable and dumb and then there is richard dean anderson he is no kurt russel sure he does a decent job and he tries to copy russels performance a little bit but he is just not as cool as russel and not nearly as good an actor as russel and russells way of playing o neill well he was much more cynical andersons o neil is way too soft i liked it that russels version just did nt give a s and had no trouble detonating the bomb until the very end of the movie michael shanks does a really good job as jackson though taking over from james spader teal c is a really annoying character he is jaffa not a jaffa just jaffa aaaarrgh a former bodyguard of a pathetic ra character seen only in the pilot and in one other episode so far teal c speaks talks and acts like a robot i ve seen better acting from jean claude van damme and the fact that teal c and the ra character and the people they saved in the movie can speak english all of a sudden is also incredibly dumb what made the aliens so scary in the movie was that they spoke an ancient language and were real monsters as for the special effects they are really good in the pilot but the very rare effects in the actual show are badly done and looks cheap especially a planet they visit with crystals it s so obvious they walk around on a soundstage with a badly made painting in the background it s an insult to us viewers that they made it look so cheap especially when they could have made it in front of a bluescreen with cgi backgrounds the x files had better effects when they aired their first episodes in that was years before sg started and they did nt have the apparent two million dollar budget per episode that sg supposedly had they must have spend all the money on catering because i don t see it on the screen incredibly boring and pointless show that could have been great if they had shot the show in hollywood with a bigger budget and better writers and better characters
generally i don t like films directed by sydney pollack the firm being somewhat of an exception and i ve never been a robert redford fan either still i thought three days of the condor must be good because of the number of praising comments it has received although the widescreen cinematography is quite pleasing for the eye and max von sydow does a nice job as the sinister professional killer i found the whole affair tremendously disappointing the film undeniably radiates paranoid atmosphere but everything is ruined by the muddled plot which doesn t seem to make any sense the film also contains one of the most unsatisfying endings i have ever seen which really leaves the viewer hanging in the air and what can one say about that absurd romance between redford and dunaway i d much rather watch any of hitchcock s films five times in succession than to sit through this piece of waste once more
i actually liked this movie until the end sure it was cheesy and pretty unlikely but still it kept my attention on a rainy afternoon until the end that is for her final performance at the prestigious classical conservatory where she has struggled to catch up to the other classically trained students what does the main character do wow them with her grasp and execution of this time honored musical tradition no she tortures and butchers the great sensuous habanera from carmen and turns it into an utterly forgettable brittany spears wannabe pop song my ears bled and in the supreme moment of horror her teachers gave her a standing ovation any teacher not in a spears induced fantasy would have failed her on the spot save your time save your ears skip this movie
i read john everingham s story years ago in reader s digest and i remember thinking what a great movie it would make and it probably would have been had michael landon never got his hands on it as far as i m concerned landon was one of the worst actors on earth and his artistic license went way over the top similar to his massacre of the little house book series is proof the acting for lack of a better word is atrocious the screenplay sloppy and there are more close ups of landon s puss than should be allowed this movie reflects everingham s story as much as little house on the prairie reflects the books is was based on it s just another vehicle to show off landons horrendous hair

this movie tries to hard to be something that it s not a good movie it wants you to be fooled from begining to end but fails from when it starts to get interesting it falls apart and you re just hoping the ending gives you some clue of just what is going on but it didn t
though the title includes the word zombies this film is not what you d expect from a movie made today though for the concept is played out about as well as would probably be expected dean jagger portrays armand louque an officer in the french army of world war i who has stumbled upon an ancient tale of soldiers turned into automatons or zombies who are impervious in battle and may hold the key to victory in the war though on whose side is not certain at first he has trouble convincing his superiors of this phenomenon but eventually french general duval george cleveland orders a non military expedition into the ancient cambodian city of angkor to find the secret of the zombies and destroy it the story is played out against the backdrop of a love triangle involving louque duval s daughter claire dorothy stone and clifford grayson robert noland all a part of the expedition when louque laments over his lack of forcefulness and resolve grayson offers him advice to go after what he wants in life with all his power that advice begins to transform louque particularly after he s successful in obtaining a stone tablet resembling a photo from the ancient city having followed a temple priest into a swamp louque now appears to hold the secret he had been seeking though it s not made clear how he has instantaneously been able to command the power of zombiefication all it takes is placing his right fist to the forehead simulating a third eye and casting his thoughts out to those he wishes to control this comes in handy for winning back his girl and taking grayson s early advice as he comments to his servant buna we re learning to be ruthless fans of early b horror flicks will recognize the use of bela lugosi s signature eye stare plucked from the film white zombie also from director victor halperin of the two movies white zombie is preferably superior both in story content and in it s depiction of the undead where the zombies have a more sinister appearance and are more threatening in revolt the zombies are enemy soldiers with a glazed over look that merely react to their mentor s commands in fact the actual revolt of the title occurs only when louque releases the soldiers from his mental command in deference to his love for claire they overrun his compound and kill him in the process not to be too harsh on the film it plays out decently within the parameters of it s story outline but if you re thinking zombies within the traditional context you ll probably be disappointed if you want to sample an early treatment of the subject the aforementioned white zombie with bela lugosi is the way to go
formula flick of guy who wants girl guy who will lie to get next to girl guy who will get best friend to help in outrageous way comedus reliefus no to help deceive girl etc this one s been done to death and with rare exception of a few z rated outings it s been done better stale plot aside the leads are attractive and there s a couple of good moments jonathon schaech has done better and his acting here came close to being phoned in not a complete loss but nothing new here in this tepid affair
the only reason i watched this film was because i had recently read robert hough s less than perfect but interesting fictionalised account of the life of big cat trainer mabel stark beaty appears as a character in the book in a less than flattering light i hadn t realised until checking the movie out later on the imdb that it was originally a serial whoever edited the original running time of minutes down to the minuted version available on dvd has done a hell of a good job the shortened version plays just as well as any b movie of the period despite the many duh what moments for instance are we really expected to believe our hero dug that twenty foot deep tiger trap in a morning without even getting his jodhpurs dirty looking over the chapter titles i see that number five is titled gorilla warfare and number eleven is called the gorilla there were no gorillas at all in the movie i guess that s where some of the cuts were made historicaly interesting
before i go on i have to admit to being a huge bon jovi fan in fact thats what attracted me to the dvd case in the first place i probably would have bought it anyway being such a big horror fan and having enjoyed the first vampires title so much but this isn t half as good not even jon could save this film for me my main problem would be that it simply isn t scary apart from jon s character derek bliss none of the other characters make an impression and you couldn t care less whether they die or not especially the annoying vampire drug addict woman the female vampire simply isn t scary or sexy rather she looks like an anorexic year girl no wonder she is so desperate for blood then another huge problem is that everything is just too bright there is no atmosphere or sense of dread i know the first vampires being set in new mexico wasn t exactly the twilight zone in terms of creepiness but yet it still managed to be dark and foreboding when it needed to be this film has no tension like that the story is basically the same as before vampire wants berzier s cross to be able to walk in daylight however the story has less cool bits this time there is no wow factor in knowing this is the master of all master the original vampire as in the first film you really don t care who or what this one is there is no army of masters instead she hides out in some old ruin which looks more like a disneyland attraction then a creepy temple so there you have it really lack of scares lack of atmosphere lack of interesting story a real let down for me personally
jessica a ghost story is as the name implies a ghost story the theme is meant to be horror but comes across closer to comedy a woman comes who was brutally murdered comes back from the dead this constitutes what this movie attempts to pass off as a plot there is really nothing more to it the movie comprises of a series of loosely connected scenes involving a guy who had an affair with this woman prior to her death immediately from the opening scenes this movie has the appearance of a straight to dvd effort unlike gems such as vacancy the movie has no sense of direction or creativity and certainly gives straight to dvd movies a bad name the direction is as poor as can be with a complete lack of suspense scares or tension even the drama elements are hopelessly handled and represent something more boring than even the worst soap opera you may have had the misfortune of enduring the acting across the board is absolutely abysmal with no one actor involved managing to show even the slightest potential of a successful acting career many of the individual scenes are incredibly long with very long pauses between dialogue exchanges i m not exaggerating the only reason i give this movie a rating of rather than is because some of the poor acting combined with even worse dialogue made for a few unintentional laughs i stress the word few in that sentence this is not overall one of the so bad it s good movies like camp blood or the nail gun massacre if you want to laugh hysterically watch those movies if you want to see a proper horror movie about ghosts watch the legend of hell house the changeling ringu the eye original korean version the grudge one missed call or phone i advise anyone who has had the good fortune of avoiding seeing jessica a ghost story to keep up the good work just forget this movie exists don t spare a thought for it
there is absolutely no plot in this movie no character development no climax nothing but has a few good fighting scenes that are actually pretty good so there you go as a movie overall is pretty bad but if you like a brainless flick that offer nothing but just good action scene then watch this movie do not expect nothing more that just that decent acting and a not so bad direction a couple of cameos from kimbo and carano i was looking to see carano a little bit more in this movie she is a good fighter and a really hot girl white is a great martial artist and a decent actor i really hope he can land a better movie in the future so we can really enjoy his art imagine a film with white and jaa together that would be awesome
this was not a well done western you ve got this nut riding around in the blazing sun in a buggy with a parasol over it killing people for his own reasons you ve got this same person sitting in a snow cave during a blizzard cutting off pieces of his anatomy which have been frostbitten then you ve got some woman in a house out in the middle of somewhere shooting wolves that are not there what is the point of this film couldn t bruce dern find something better to do this was a waste of film
i am one of the biggest fans of silent comedians and have probably reviewed more buster keaton films for imdb than any other person every film he made from the beginning of his career to the early s with only two exceptions have i reviewed so you can tell i am a major fan it s because of this that i found this episode so painful and hard to watch i loved this man s films and kept thinking buster how could you well now that i think about it i guess i can see why buster keaton starred in this god awful episode of the twilight zone he d lost much of his fortune after a messy divorce in the early s and his film career as a leading man was long passed as well now in the s keaton needed the money and loved his resurgence in popularity so he whored himself out to anyone willing to pay appearing in beach films and this mess of an episode of a great series the biggest problem with the episode is that it is just terribly written and buster deserved much better the show is supposed to be funny but isn t and instead of a homage to silent films is just painful to watch particularly with keaton putting that stupid time travel helmet on as well as all the poorly executed slapstick do yourself a favor skip this one it s a pale imitation of the greatness that once was keaton s career
this movie has a very broadway feel the backdrop the acting the noise and yet that s all it has some sense of a broadway without the bang the movie is slow paced the picture disjointed the singing pops up on you so that you suddenly are reminded it s a musical disappointing sinatra intolerable sinatra s fianc surely the pitch and the accent of her voice was unnecessary tolerable mr i remember the numbers on my dice delight brando s understated singing very biased surprise how much jean simmons looks like vivien leigh in her havana scenes it s the bone structure how i would ve killed to have seen miss leigh in a role challenging brando again
this was one of the worst movies i ve ever seen horrible acting not funny at all and well just boring i can only assume all these out of fav all time movie comments are actually the actors themselves in disguise idk what the runtime on this movie is i m sure its listed on this page it certainly felt like an eternity if your looking for a tough challenge attempt to sit through this awful movie otherwisedon t waste your time as i did on this one
really i am truly amazed to see the glowing reviews here this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen it is one big pathetic grainy clich i would have laughed out loud and a lot but was on a date with an ex military guy i could not hide my other response boredom yes i think my date a flat line good old boy liked it that s not a compliment i know an actor wants to work fine for the others but ralph come on it was a painful tease from ralph i vote a only because ralph looked so stunning but i must plead ralph how could you and why i m going to go watch the end of the affair to heal and recover now c
this is a german film from that is something to do with some women who come to a castle and beyond that i can t really tell you their purpose or even what the purpose of the movie is i can tell you that there s several women who also moonlight as servants at this particular castle who strip put on body paint and gyrate to bongos like they were at the goth kit kat klub though and that seems to be a good portion of the run time of this film yeah there seems to be something with devil worship and vampires and there s some girl on girl stuff etc but the main focus seems to be the painted babes gyrating away in the basement i did rather like the eye rolling of one of the main housekeepers devil worshipers that lent an authenticity to the proceedings and made her even more evil looking was that wanda the evil lesbian as billed in the credits no matter if you aren t too picky about your lesbian devil worshiping movies you might like this otherwise it s pretty dull stuff and i couldn t even finish it i was so bored out of
this agonizing comedy drama got surprisingly sterling reviews upon its release in i remember opening the movie section of the l a times and looking at a page advertisement for chapter two filled with glowing captions like better than the goodbye girl and neil simon does it again what does neil simon do he takes an autobiographical situation remarrying too soon after the death of a beloved spouse and makes it rusty unpleasant and worst of all unfunny james caan plays neil er that is george a writer who can t seem to get back into life after losing his wife enter spirited marsha mason real life mrs simon soon to be ex mrs simon who attempts to love george despite his moods and general melancholy mason is very appealing here and might ve saved the day were it not for caan s indifference not to mention a sub plot concerning painfully thin blonde valerie harper which brings the proceedings to a screeching halt i liked mason s outburst at the end i am wonderful i am nuts about me but i saw no happy ending for these two people and time proved me right from
the concept of the legal gray area in love crimes contributes to about of the movie s appeal the other can be attributed to it s flagrant bad ness to say that sean young s performance as a so called district attorney is wooden is a gross understatement with her bland suits and superfluous hair gel young does a decent job at convincing the audience of her devout hatred for men why else would she ask her only friend to pose as a prostitute just so she can arrest cops who try to pick up on them this hatred is also the only reason why she relentlessly pursues a perverted photographer who gives women a consensual thrill and the driving force behind this crappy movie watching young go from frigid to full frontal nudity does little to raise interest but the temper tantrum she throws standing next to a fire by a lake does watching her rant and rave about her self loathing and sexual frustration makes love crimes worth the rental fee but it s all downhill to and from there despite her urge to bring patrick bergin s character to justice her policing skills completely escape her in the throes of her own tired lust and passion patrick bergin does a decent enough job as a slimy sociopath if it worked in sleeping with the enemy it sure as hell can work in this but i can t help but wonder if the noticeable lack of energy young brings to the film conflicts with his sliminess i m guessing it does and the result is a thriller with thrills that are thoroughly bad and yet comedic
the haunting if you have seen the original you know a great ghost story it s perfection on film it s a haunting tale of people who go into a haunted house and with the simple trick of sound and movements it terrified people it still remains effective to this day if you appreciate film so when the haunting was remade in a lot of people pretty much had the same reaction what why what the but in my opinion if a remake is respectful enough and just wants to reinvent the story for the newer generation i m pretty cool with it this is definitely not the case this is just a disrespectful boring shame that will waste your time and i guarantee will deliver no scares pfft pg what where they thinking not much apparently when her mother dies and her sister evicts her nell receives a phone call telling her about an ad for an insomnia study run by doctor david marrow at hill house a secluded manor upon arrival nell meets mr and mrs dudley a strange pair of caretakers who do not stay on the property after dark shortly thereafter two other participants in the study arrive wild theo and bad sleeper luke sanderson along with doctor marrow unknown to the participants doctor marrow s true purpose is to study the psychological response to fear each night the caretakers chain the gate outside hill house preventing anyone from getting in or out until morning when the caretakers open the lock there are no working telephones inside hill house and the nearest town is several miles away doctor marrow revels the story of hill house the house was built by hugh crain crain built the house for his wife hoping to fill it with a large family full of children however all of crain s children died during birth crain s wife killed herself before the house was finished and crain became a recluse the first night theo and nell begin to experience strange phenomenon within the house including odd noises and inexplicable temperature changes nell is confronted after the main hallway is vandalized with the words welcome home eleanor and becomes extremely distraught setting out to prove that the house is haunted by the souls of those victimized by crain s cruelty she learns that crain built his fortune by exploiting kidnapped children for slave labor and murdering them when they were of no more use to him he then burned the bodies in the house s fireplace to hide any evidence she also learns that crain had a second wife named carolyn of whom nell is descended everyone thinks she s crazy while nell is convinced this is where she belongs seriously i suggest you stay away from this film it s really stupid and pointless not to mention the actress the played nell lili taylor completely annoyed me her performance her look just everything about her don t get me started on things i would do just to not see her in film again catherine zeta jones just didn t fit in her role as well and liam neeson a wonderful actor wasted talent once again the effects are way over the top and too computerized i just can t believe that they would trash a wonderful classic with this crud believe me if you are going to be afraid of something be afraid of seeing how you can turn a great ghost story into an annoying piece of overblown stupid oh this film is already hurting me just don t see it it s bad
granted this seems like a good idea steve martin goldie hawn and john cleese in a neil simon comedy where can you go wrong watch the movie and you ll find out in truth martin the lead is mis cast he s not doing the great slapstick he s known for from movies like the jerk but instead plays a sort of in between character that doesn t work hawn with no one to play off of is terrible cleese is the only even partially funny member to top it off the plot is pretty stupid i can t say how much of it may have been changed but the characters seem to lack the slightest bit of common sense they blunder through new york not doing anything right and unfortuneatly nothing funny not only is the whole premise completely unbelievable it seems to give the message that people who don t live in new york aren t very bright a theme repeated throughout the movie in summation instead of seeing this go rent the original odd couple again
this is what happens when you re living in china and the local video store is running thin on english language titles you are blessed with this work of what appears to be yes romanian cinema nevertheless i think that it has real comedic potential spoilers technically follow though i don t think that it would in fact spoil anyone s viewing pleasure to ask why a film set in a casino has a scene of beach archery even in flashback that mystery and many other conundrums remain to be exploited by desperate comedians perhaps when they re stuck in bucharest let me also wonder aloud why perfectly good looking people allow themselves to abuse themselves on film like this it s sad
this british pot boiler has one thing going for it the young men are uniformly good looking the older men are opinionated right wing thatcherites whose behavior brings back all the acrimony of the reagan thatcher years young or old however morals in this three part mini series are universally suspect and no one comes off particularly well nick is a handsome young gay man fresh out of oxford it is not pivotal to the story but he has an extraordinarily beautiful head of hair which makes watching this drivel much easier nick comes to london with a friend whose father gerald is a rich conservative politician and babysits his sister cat while the family frolics in the south of france they neglect to inform him that when upset cat cuts herself with an assortment of knives and other kitchen implements nick mistakes their self serving gratitude for affection and moves in finding out too late just how much they despise and patronize him inexplicably nick lives in this house for four years but as the plot depends on this point it s best not to question it while nick is most pleasing to look at he is unbearably obsequious his coy subjection to rich bigots soon had me climbing the walls deeply closeted except to cat she guesses his big secret on sight he does like a little anonymous sex just so we know he is actually gay though it hardly seems possible nick takes a lover who is even more closeted than he supercilious tories scorn and insult the two blacks in the film so imagine the venom which spews forth when nick s sexual orientation is reported in a tabloid gerald in true tory fashion has become involved in several personal and financial scandals so the revelations about nick add to his embarrassment this gives gerald one final opportunity to roundly castigate the hapless boy except for one brief moment of indignation nick takes the abuse heaped upon him in silence and tacit agreement denial self loathing naivet or ignorance you decide if you can manage to sit through this whole thing without throwing something at the set
the underground comedy movie is possibly the worst train wrecks i ve ever seen luckily i didn t pay for this movie and my friend reluctantly agreed to watch it again siting that it was so awful but he needed to prove to me how awful it was i love off color comedy i figured at the least it would have that and i would be entertained no instead the acting was so awful the jokes were extremely cheesy and the plot was no where to be found maybe there wasn t supposed to be a plot so i can t hold that against this movie it s pretty sad where the funniest thing in a comedy is an old woman having her head hit off by a bat by batman a man dressed in a baseball uniform wielding a bat hilarious simply genius i got the feeling watching this movie that its creators made it and laughed hysterically with their friends about it perhaps this was full of inside jokes we just didn t understand or perhaps it s the worst piece of trash ever made and it should be locked away in a vault and dumped in the arctic ocean p s don t buy this movie
georgia rule has got to be one of if not the worst movie i have ever seen in my life the whole movie has a very surreal feel that made me gasp what out loud at least times throughout its grueling two hour course advertised in its trailer as a movie about three generations of women jane fonda as the matriarch felicity huffman as her daughter and lindsay lohan as the rebellious over sexed scantily clad grand daughter the viewer thinks this will be a clich light chick flick about growing up and coming together as a family talk about false advertisement at it worst after many shots of animals doing funny things in the background of pivotal scenes and not to mention a whole five minutes focusing on an old woman who comes into a doctor s office weekly to have her diaper changed or the fact that this movie is actually about lindsay lohan s character being sexually abused by her step father georgia rule creates its own genre of cinema the ungrounded horribly acted inappropriate comedy dealing with extremely serious issues in the most awkward surreal strange way if garry marshall wanted this movie to be a drama comedy then he should have watched the royal tenenbaums sideways junebug and so on and so on the only way i feel i can get a reader to understand the horrific genre that georgia rule falls under is to create a hypothetical situation say that the movie the year old virgin was about the main character being celibate because he was sexually molested as a child but instead of having the movie take a more dramatic turn belly laughs and comedy would ensue with all of the characters reactions being that of fake lifeless human beings pretending to care throw in a yellow parakeet dermot mulroney as the flattest most non dimensional character that could have been cut completely out of this poorly written script along with a male character who throws away all of his religious beliefs and morals to be with a trashy too tanned girl who shares none of the same interests as he as well as an an unnecessary car chase scene unreal moments of characters trying to relate to each other and you ve got georgia rule i found this movie to be an insult to any of those people out there who are struggling filmmakers screenwriters actors editors etc who have a lot more talent and aren t getting noticed don t see this movie my rule and if you must get sufficiently drunk before hand
even if it were remotely funny this mouldy waxwork of a film would still be soberingly disrespectful stopping just short of digging up the boys corpses and re enacting weekend at bernie s but only just producer larry harmon and the director of the frickin ernest films use holding the copyright as an excuse to crap all over stan and ollie s legacy gailard sartain does a fair ollie impersonation but bronson pinchot wouldn t reach tenth place in a stan lookalike contest even if they were both spot on the film would be no less detestable the less said about the surrounding catastrophe the better makes utopia look like a dignified swan song
i find myself wondering what the people who gave this a saw in it that i didn t this movie has a very hard time following and or staying to a plot if someone tells you it s a comedy don t be fooled it s about percent odd drama and comedy all actors turn in a great performance that cannot be denied however it seems like it really lost something somewhere don t know if the original script was good and it had to be edited down or what this had potential and instead it was really a flop i would really like the hour and a half i invested in this movie back but the video rental place doesn t do returns on time save your money and see something else
there is nothing cool hip or clever about this film liking it just reveals an ignorance of true art cinema how can you so easily forget that the central fact of this entire film is that these mean ugly people are serial killers if they have to dismember total strangers in order to be a family again then we don t want them to be a family what part of that did you have trouble grasping why applaud this filth this silly filth is what you do if you can t do art one s head life must be deeply empty to mistake this shallow viciousness as interesting this is a camera without a brain what really makes an artwork cool is profundity questioning the status quo from a perspective informed by a knowledge of history or in this case a knowledge of anything would be preferable instead this is just randomly piling up the ugliest images available in a world in meltdown thanks to just the sort of empty meanness glorified as cool cause it s so far out man these same violent events actually happen every day they are not just in the film they refer to actual soul less people who would do those same things to you do you want those things done to you a child could have thought this up it required zero imagination it is not surrealism this lazy crap has no content is saying nothing it s just the worst of the evening news it is saying nothing new nothing we don t already know it s the emperor s new clothes the director hoping there are enough uneducated children proud of their streak of inhumanity for this sloppy filth to fly i can see director miike s demented fans now chain smoking teens and twenties drunks covered in tattoos with metal hanging from holes punched in their faces their knowledge base inversely proportional to their intelligence estimate of themselves there is no plot to this it is just sheer exploitation of shock value violence there is no hidden meaning anywhere in this poorly made film it is fine to explore a film to see if you can find cinematic devices that are ingeniously artistic but you cannot uncover a hidden meaning if one is not there to do that you need to view review a real piece of cinema there are plenty out there directed by fellini bergman fassbinder herzog altman bunuel kurosawa lynch tarkovsky peter greenaway tarantino guillermo del toro richard linklater eisenstein aronofsky gus van sant soderbergh shyamalan ordet why don t you view a real art film by the likes of these giants this wannabe director miike will never make a film equal to one of the geniuses i just listed because he just doesn t have the talent anyone could slap together some chaotic crap like visitor q teenagers could throw that together in one afternoon there s no message no meaning no plot nothing to it at all there are long lists of art films to learn from but this visitor q is not an art film in any respect it has no content to it it s just one banal horror piled onto another and the point to remember about those hideous crimes is that those things happen every single day somewhere in the world they are not okay because they are just in the film they refer to actual soul less people who would do those same things to you do you want those things done to you to others why because this world is already ugly enough thanks to people who enjoy thinking about horrific events like this there are sooooo many art films out there to use your mind to deconstruct but you are wasting your talents with this piece of crap there is no deeper meaning there is nothing to analyze why keep trying i ve spent nearly years watching practically every film ever made and keeping up with all the new ones but i ve never seen anything as disgustingly pointless as this it s not imaginative or even shocking because these types of events happen daily all over the world to make this film or even to favorably review it has caused over young airheads who don t know any better to think it s cool they may grow up thinking that convincing others some of whom may end up doing these things convicted killers often reveal how they started out just this way by being desensitized to the horror of this gruesome inhumanity trust me on this i know cool and cool this piece of crap ain t visitor q has the feel of a genuine snuff film and i m still not sure it isn t actually your actions have consequences son the world is awful enough already some violence like this could happen to you or to the socially irresponsible director who cranked out this fake art film believe me you won t be thinking it s cool when someone is sawing your skull in half

i really can t believe this movie is not in the imdb worst it is absolutely terrible when i originally saw it i remember talking about it in a college class and two other people had also seen it we were all telling other class members not to see it because it was so horrible by the time we were done some others wanted to see it just because they could not believe anything was as bad as we were saying it was don t be like them just pass this by i m sure everyone involved with this movie would also prefer you never see them in this movie
i caught this movie on sci fi before heading into work if you ve any interest in seeing dean cain dive and avoid being enveloped in flames at least a dozen times this movie is for you if that doesn t peak your interest well i m afraid you ll wish that you were the one about to be enveloped in flames because this movie is pretty bad the acting to begin with is awful awful awful the characters are all completely obnoxious and the dialogue is worse than your typical z grade sci fi movie towards the end the movie began to remind me of hollow man complete with escape via elevator shaft except with a dragon not a naked invisible man unlike other similar flicks however this one wasn t even awesomely bad it was just plain bad

this is not a children s movie this movie is like a bad acid trip for kids under the age of for a month my year old from time to time would ask me why was that rabbit bleeding from its mouth or why did the bulldozer bury all the rabbits and that wasn t the worst of it we stopped it about a hour in but the damage had been done intensely morbid oppressive violent fortunately he s finally forgotten about the whole wretched thing whomever decided this movie should be marketed to children should be brought up on charges go ahead censure me my conscience is clear
this is one of the worst b slashers i ve ever seen in my life the ending is something you have to see to believe the movie starts with harry standing and phillip standing sitting on the stairs with their mother watching their father come down the chimney while dressed in a santa suit he puts the presents under the tree eats the cookies and milk and then goes back up the chimney phillip goes to bed but harry comes down only to find his father dressed in a santa suit sexually pleasuring his mother then harry goes up stairs smashes a snow globe grabs a shard of glass and cuts himself then you move on to the present you see harry he is a lonely man who sleeps in a santa suit and watches little kids through a pair of binoculars he has two books one book for good kids and the other for bad kids he writes down everything they do in these books the guy is a creep he also works at the jolly dream toy factory his brother phillip has a family and two kids and lives in a nice house when harry finds out that his boss only cares about profits he goes and collects all the toys and delivers them to a few kids then he travels to a church and kills people then he goes to another house and puts presents under the tree the kids catch him but they go back to bed so harry goes to the bedroom and kills the father and leaves as he is walking towards a house a bunch of kids spot him and run up to him the parent s are nervous and try to get their kids to come back to them so they don t get hurt how do they know that harry is the killer sure you have to be suspicious because you never know who it could be harry gives the kids presents and the father pulls out a switch blade in an attempt to stab him in front of the kids when harry runs off the townsfolk light torches and follow him to kill him they don t even know that he is the killer when harry reaches his brother s house his his brother and him have a little talk and phillip strangles him he only loses consciousness phillip loads harry back into his van when harry wakes up he takes off the ending is something i could not believe once again you ll have to see it to believe it one thing that bugged me was the black santa that s right the man in the santa suit they saw was a white man so why did they bring in a black man skip this and see silent night deadly night and santa s slay you ll get your money s worth seeing those two films they are better than this pile of garbage i give this movie star out of wish i could give it stars cause that is what this movie deserves
letting the class watch this in english was a bad idea films that are serious and more educational can have an effect but it appears this one didn t have any effect whatsoever on the class whenever the teacher left conversations quickly started and i didn t hear the words shakespeare or tempest being used at all and when you look at this it is easy to see why the acting is nothing special everyone seems bored to bits just reading from the page without a care in the world shakespeare always did prefer expository dialogue to action and death but i just couldn t understand a word anyone was saying the costumes aren t too bad and neither are the special effects the class may not have loved the film but they weren t exactly taking the p ss either but it is hard to joke at a film that is devoid of any sort of inspiration or joy the scenes on the ship at the start of the film weren t too badly done though the rain looked a bit unrealistic everything else was done well and good but where were the severed heads and exploding masts where was the death where was the inspiration the character of ariel would have been taken a lot more seriously had he been wearing clothes but as all was on show he was just another excuse for a joke this film is not in any way appealing to either sex the women and girls won t have any romance or comedy to enjoy and there is an abundance of naked men and lack of action or death that will put most men and boys off the tempest wasn t badly done but this felt like something the producers had to make not something they wanted to make and the general boredom and lack of inspiration show
star rating the works just misses the mark that little bit in between lagging behind the pits in this debut effort for nick park s beloved man and dog they are forced to fly to the moon when good old wallace runs out of cheese as well as being the shortest feature at just minutes this w g adventure is also the earliest and it kinda shows the plasticine animation is a little creaky and funny here sort of reminiscent of the mork animation about the little man in the box admirable though the craftsmanship behind it is i ve never actually been hugely into wallace gromit maybe a bit too clean and traditional for someone of my generation the only one i ve really enjoyed is the wrong trousers and that was more from when i was younger and less aware of shall we say the seedier pleasures of life i was driven to actively seek out this early effort due to the resurgence in popularity as a result of the hugely successful recent film adaptation as technically impressive as the first two all things considered this one lacks the emotional angle it s successors were to possess that being said it s fairly good fun as a first try and certainly set the standard for greater things to come two stars but a good two stars
first of all i apologize for my english everybody from ex yugoslavia who isn t some extreme serbian radical will agree with me this movie shows serbian side and only serbian side no serbian crimes were represented luckily everyone can see that this movie was made by serbians so there is no neutrality all professionals who were interviewed are not professionals at all some guy only read a book written by some radical serbian the other one is genocide denier etc etc even slovenians were accused in this movie and the whole war in slovenia lasted for few days and only because slovenians were lucky there weren t many serbs in slovenia and yna couldn t reach slovenia trough croatia after croatia serbia war started every slovenian is outraged by all accusations in this movie every reasonable croat will agree with one thing the independence was too early perhaps all major conflicts could be avoided however mentioning wwii and some unrelated things was truly pathetic attempt to justify everything just imagine japanese throwing nuclear bombs at seattle and washington and saying that was justified by hiroshima and nagasaki you will find no evidence about strangled yna soldier and murdered serbian civilians near vukovar but you can find the tape with reporter committing that his claims about serbian civilians near vukovar were lies all over the internet and the director forgot to mention the whole bombing of vukovar by yna now on serbian and montenegro side and full of serbs and montenegrin and let s not start about the chetnik movement at the beginning it was simply a resistance movement but director somehow forgot to mention collaboration with the nazis including ustashe ethnic cleansing and fighting again the yugoslav partisans there are thousands of other things but all of it can be easily checked there are many misleading things in this movie only few of all accusations are true every croatian is outraged by this movie i believe that i don t need to mention srebrenica genocide denial the genocide that has too many evidence imagine the movie about holocaust denial this movie is the same and according to this movie bosnian muslims in sarajevo bombed themselves every bosnian muslim is outraged by this movie somehow director forgot to mention the short occupation of small piece of macedonian fyrom land by the serbs croatians slovenians bosnians and macedonians never entered serbian borders if you are not serbian and you actually started to believe some things from this movie know that serbs have some kind of propaganda that croats bosnian muslims and macedonians are actually serbs who made up their history so even of serbs will say that this movie is little extreme and pro serbian and serbian radicals are very very pleased with this movie there is about serbs who vote for radicals i think everyone understands my points in here in this so called documentary is very little truth and my advice to everyone is inform yourself before watching this movie after that you will only laugh at all pathetic accusations watch real neutral documentaries about death of yugoslavia
i mean the word pedestrian seems the producers of the film forgot to have anything interesting happen faith domergue can do better than this she is supposed to be the mysterious vengeful cobra goddess torn by love for marshall thompson there s an idea eh instead she s a common would be housewife of the fifties and the single flat expression she wears throughout the film makes me think they shot it all in the early morning before faith had her coffee as for the rest of the cast they are all so earnestly all american that the result is laughable this is ground more productively covered in val lewton in the cat people i think cult of the cobra should really be titled cult of the contractual obligation why else would so many otherwise talented people sleepwalk their way though a slow moving predictable derivative failure like this
this video contains an outsmart way to confuse and manipulate americans about islam it s a pity that the people who did it really believe that american people is so dumb to believe in it perhaps as an american citizen every person must protest against this kind of crap if you want to know the truth about islam don t let nobody tell you the quran is public you can read it by yourself and decide if what they say it s true or false the video uses a lot of audiovisual strategies directed to manipulate and associate things that are not even related the music used at some points prepare the public to hate what they see even if they don t really understand what s going on in there they use images that are misplaced from their original content to end the comment i would like to make a reflexion don t you think you can do the same exact movie with every religion in the world
i d passed this title or times while in blockbuster looking for something halfway decent to watch all i can say is that they were all out halfway decent films the night i chose to rent this i will give it credit for being leaps and bounds better than dracula but in actuality that s pretty easy to say since this one didn t have caper van dien in it the other things it lacked in spades were an interesting cast interesting story good dialog and originality but i suppose you can t have everything spoilers ahead the misfit crew of vampire hunters one of which was a vampire go figure flew around from mining colony to mining colony trying to wipe out all the vampires it could find the crew consists of the cocky ne er do well captain who dies early on his by the book yet inexperienced first mate the aforementioned vampire vampire hunter not a typo a wannabe cowboy and a really really butch asian commando tough guy female it almost sounds like the cast for mtv s the real world after the captain dies in a violent confrontation with a mob of bloodsuckers and as it turns out lovers of the finer parts of human anatomy his first mate takes over blah blah blah everyone hates him blah blah blah i could go on but as i said it s the same storyline used in about a hundred other films of the genre the effects were cheese and why michael ironside was in this movie is beyond me the vampire vampire hunter still not a typo was pretty hot but of course if you re waiting for her to expose more than just her cleavage look elsewhere i can t say that it was the worst film i ve seen as i actually rented starship troopers but wait for this one to come on the sci fi channel
universal s answer to the exorcist isn t a very good one unfortunately the film offers bland unimaginative direction from michael winner who wastes an outstanding cast with a screenplay massing crater sized plot holes not to mention it s unbearably silly never explaining certain key elements within the story model cristina raines moves into a high rise owned by the catholic church with a creepy blind priest john carradine who holes up in there always at the window she begins to suffer faint spells and nausea what s worse is tenants she meets in the building such as burgess meredith with a cat and a canary and a young beverly d angelo as a lesbian ava gardner looking great at is the realtor who showed raines the place cristina s lover is chris sarandon whose wife committed suicide after finding out they were having an affair jos ferrer has a small role as the priest of the brotherhood who informs monsignor arthur kennedy to be careful as he heads to the very high rise not only housing carradine but raines as well sarandon sends a hired hand up to the high rise one night to check out a certain room above cristina s apartment where she heard metallic clanging and other loud racket he winds up dead the very same night cristina kills her dead father in a nightmare screaming mad on the street cristina does indeed have blood on her which leads police detective eli wallach and partner christopher walken to investigate them with sure certainty that it all somehow leads back to sarandon who is a hot shot lawyer who once beat the cop in court regarding the whole wife s suicide that case is really a motivating factor is wallach s dogged approach to finding out whose blood was really on cristina and if sarandon has anything to do with it you also have martin balsam as a professor who understands this type of latin cristina mysteriously understands and unbilled actors such as jeff goldblum as a fashion photographer and tom berenger as a man interested in this certain room that has become available in the very room now renovated that cristina once stayed in what bothers me more than anything is lack of explanation towards the end of the film wallach and walken are forgotten and we are left wondering why they just up and quit investigating their characters are just left on the back burner how the priests know that now is the time when a certain man will die and must be replaced to guard a certain gate in that high rise and why cristina suffers through the trauma she does isn t adequately explained how certain ghosts just appear to cristina and disappear when she tries to show gardner the rooms they occupied during a cat s birthday see for yourself isn t adequately explained not to mention gardner s role in the grand scheme of things she brings people to that high rise but what is really her reasons in the film it seems like this film should ve been longer and cleared things up left lost to a rushed conclusion that is just laughable when it should be scary
this movie forever left an impression on me i watched it as a freshman in high school and was home alone that night i think i lost all respect for robert reed as an actor having been a huge fan of the brady bunch i also thought the role of chuck connor was horrendous and evil however this movie made such an impact on me that i am now a volunteer in the women s state prison doing bible studies and church services and trying to change womens lives one at a time what fascinates me is that so few people actually watched this movie none of my friends watched it and my family is clueless to this day when i discuss this movie because they didn t see it

description corny utterly stupid and worthless it s so cheap and lame it ll make you wonder why these abnormally dumb people even wasted months or so to spend a budget i m guessing this probably no more than dollars to make this movie it was just hysterical to watch with or without mystery science theater i am giving you the best advice in the world spare yourself spare your time life and money by not i repeat not even ponder about whether you should see this movie this movie is so corny it ll make your face turn purple of outraged boredom if you have a one digit iq then be my guest and watch this absolutely despicable movie you might actually admire it like i said before if you have a one digit iq with about actors of your own a few puppets you bought at a garage sale and of course cameras and music i gaurentee you ll make a slightly more entertaining home video than this piece of absolute crap
ok so here s the basic plot it is peter sellers is dr fu manchu a year old chinese man who has lived quite a long time the film opens with his birthday in which he celebrates by drinking a special elixir that even the film never mentions prolongs his life well on this occasion the elixir is clumsily dropped by an assistant kato if you remember the pink panther movies and he orders his minions to then go find rare items to make the elixir this creates a global man hunt in which his henchmen end up robbing museums of diamonds and venturing into london to meet up with dr fu s nemisis a retired scotland yard detective nayland smith also played by sellers who tries to stop him in what is suppose to be a witty comedic adventure this was apparantly sellers last full length feature film that he made before he died the terrible tragedy is that he was in it sellers who is such a gifted comedian and has had memorable funny roles in the panther movies and particualrly in the movie the party is anything but that in this film this film was absolute torture to sit through and i couldn t even finish it he completly dies and i kept cringing while watching sellers performance after coming of the great work of being there a year earlier how i mean how can he make this and how did this thing even get made like one person mentioned the first minutes are ok but then it is all downhill avoid like the plague rating out of
feast of all saints where when was the feast of all saints storyline and theme edited out what a waste of a wonderful title there is never anything in the story that has the remotest connection to the feast of all saints nor is there anything in the story about all souls day which the term is referencing why bother to use this title if you never intend to including any kind of storyline or theme about all souls day or the feast of all saints embarrassly bad script amateur writing how did they attract such great talent to this clunker the writing is so amateur characters that have known each other all their life go into big long speeches about their life history for the sake of the audience not at all the way people talk to each other what was the director thinking the directing is equally bad the forced and overly deliberate style feels amateurish in one scene a character is yelling take your hands off of me and no one is touching him the most badly directed scene however is the incredibly over the top battle scene at the beginning of the film excessive gore in a very fake silly battle scenethere are so many dead people in the most fake battle scene it looks like a saturday night live skit you can see extras waiting for their cues to walk across camera everyone plays their death scene like th grade boys exaggerating every little gasp and twitch the blood on battle victims is so excessive and carelessly applied it looks like someone used a ketchup dispenser and just squirted straight lines of red on the costumes this whole battle scene comes off as the spoof of a really cheesy war movie you almost expect someone like will ferrell and mike myers to ride up on a horse and deliver the punchline who in real life would ever behave this way the most ridiculous bit of writing directing and casting is actually the focus of the scene a little girl is standing under the dead body of her hanging father who is terribly mutilated and literally dripping blood form his gaping wounds even a totally idiot would know he is dead yet she is very monotonously repeating over and over daddy daddy while looking at someone off screen she delivered it with about as much believability and passion as you could expect from an non actor kid that had been repeating the line for the cameras all day even if the poor kid had any acting skills the scene is completely unbelievable the little girl wouldn t even be in the middle of the battlefield after hours of carnage surrounded by hundreds of dead bodies while she calmly stands there natural instincts would had the kid screaming and terrified running away from the bloody carnage are we suppose to be horrified or laugh one particularly goofy detail that gives the scene an snl satire tone is the father hanging with a huge hook through his mouth and cheek he looks like a fish on a hook the unintentionally funny details make the whole scene come across as fake and silly in fantasy la la land mothers and daughters are the same age another funny detail is that you see a central character the little girl s mother at the end of the scene and in the next scene that occurs years later she looks exactly the same she is still young and beautiful and now the same age as her daughter i almost turned the movie off right there because the direction and writing were obviously awful but i tried to stick it out because i wanted to see the louisiana settings and i like all the actors i don t know what these fine actors were thinking when they accepted these roles who was the targeted audience the excessive amount of blood and badly acted violence in the opening scene are weirdly out of place with the soap opera storytelling tone that follows it is also a strange way to start a movie that for the rest of the time seems targeted to romance novel reading females weird inconsistency in tone
too bad chuck norris has gone to tv he made some good movies before he hit tv this is a typical tv movie intended to pass the time unfortunately it wastes chuck s talent as an actor i hope he returns to the big screen some day
bad acting bad lighting bad plot this had the quality of a porno movie i have seen more interesting home video of a boring wedding than this movie it sucked big time don t waste your time or money on this crap it s amazing that they allow this kind of smut to even be released on video it should be a crime
i commented on this when it first debuted and gave it a thumbs in the middle review remarking that i d give it the benefit of the doubt beyond just the first episode i ve seen a total of six episodes now up to this point in june and as a lifelong batman fanatic i can say without hesitation this show is utter crap everything s wrong with it everything getting past just the lousy animation and design the stories are ridiculously convoluted and with no character development or apparent interest by the writers of this dreck to give any substance to any stories and for god s sake is it just me or is the joker in every episode is gotham that much of a revolving door justice system or again is it just a complete lack of interest in the writers to put any effort into other villains see no character development above and to make matters worse every single joker tale is the same part formula joker gasses people joker sets out to gas the whole city batman saves the day pfeh there was one episode i saw that wasn t a joker story the title escapes me but the villain was that nefarious cluemaster the think thank thunk episode with the quiz show that was the single worst batman story i ve ever seen heard or read yes worse than i ve got batman in my basement i can t really say what i feel this show is because it s probably against the tos but it starts with b and rhymes with fastardization thank goodness for the existence of the timm dini etc era of bat entertainment back from the fox and kids wb days stuff that good and i should have known this just couldn t possibly have lasted forever unfortunately
disney goes to the well one too many times as anybody who has seen the original little mermaid will feel blatantly ripped off celebrating the birth of their daughter melody ariel and eric plan on introducing her to king triton the celebration is quickly crashed by ursula s sister morgana who plans to use melody as a defense tool to get the king s trident stopping the attack ariel and eric build a wall around the ocean while melody grows up wondering why she cannot go in there awful and terrible is what describes this direct to video sequel little mermaid gives you that feeling everything you watch seemed to have come straight other disney movies i guess disney can only plagiarize itself do not tell me that the penguin and walrus does not remind you of another duo from the lion king other disappointing moments include the rematch between sebastien and louie the royal chef they terribly under played it the climax between morgana and everyone seemed to be another disappointment i will not give anything away but in minutes everything seemed incredibly cramped and too much to handle an embarrassment to disney little mermaid is better left to rent and laugh at then you can prepare for the rest of the other sequels disney is going to drown you in later on
it s been a while since seeing this the first time so i watched it again with the second movie in the series while i realize there is a rd movie out that i haven t seen yet i ll review under the original title just from the standpoint of production value screen writing and movie making this movie fails on many levels though it succeeds on a few as well what can you expect from a low budget b movie not much and it works from the standpoint of production however the writing is certainly disjointed with little in the way of character development exactly what i d expect when there is an agenda to a film i didn t have a problem with the acting the cast is solid however the screenplay in both movies gives the actors little opportunity to really stretch themselves because the film is christian this is predictable as you can t very well portray violent chaos of the end times without also breaking some of the ethics which are normally associated with christianity in other words the mistake comes in making this into a g rated film when the content even in the most conservative of bible interpretations would be r rated by any measure so if the purpose of the movie is to scare people into christian faith then the movie should be somewhat scary right however you can t comment on a film adaptation from a book without commenting on the book or in this case series of books there are certainly plenty of christian materials worthy enough to be made into movies but not the left behind series and these movies ultimately fail because while being best sellers they are poorly written novels based on bad theology as a southern baptist minister i confess that the books were a guilty pleasure for me though i have yet to finish the last two books of the series i have described them as decent fiction and if the books would take the point of view that this is one possibility or interpretation of the subject of biblical eschatology study of the end times then i could live with that however this series is divisive in christian circles because it promotes the literalist interpretation of all scripture above a more proper hermeneutic inevitably this leads to the pre trib pre millenial dispensation point of view which confines an all powerful god far too by humanity s world in other words as i ve always said god shouldn t need our helicopters and bombs to do his ultimate work but because many people particularly unstudied christians can t think beyond their own world views we are left with a pro conservative fundamentalist stance with regard to bible interpretation and attempts to push it through as the only interpretation thus the books carry with them an agenda not so much to get the lost to understand their need for christ but to state that the fundamentalist point of view is the only valid way to understand the bible i recall very clearly reading several years ago in the second novel a scene where the characters reference a person who was left behind because of his non adherence to this point of view as if real christians worthy to be raptured couldn t possibly hold to another eschatology this is disturbing for several reasons the least of which is because a rapture is only briefly mentioned in scripture and it s connection to real end time prophecy is tenuous at best but the real issue with these books is comes in the way they divide the christian community and how they portray true christian behavior ultimately i feel they harden more people to an otherwise legitimate faith religion instead of win people towards it it turns all christians into caricatures equally disdained and laughed at by the world despite the fact that there is theological room for a wide diversity of believes within christian thought and practice as a christian body on the whole we ve done enough of that kind of damage to society over years of history and we certainly don t need to promote it by film to thousands maybe millions of others thus the left behind movies fail because the left behind books aren t worthy to be interpreted into movies
this movie is like the thousand cat and mouse movies that preceded it the following may look like a spoiler but it really just describes a large class of movies there is the passionate wise main character his goofy but well meaning sidekick with his ill placed attempts at humorous comments the initially hostile but soon softened gorgeous lady who triggers the inevitable unlikely love story the loved ones taken hostage and of course the careless evil adversary with his brutal minions everybody has seen tons of these movies already and national treasure is like any one of them with only a slightly modified wrapping every turn of the story was easily predicted and i can assure you i am not the sharpest tool in the shed i am quite tired of feeling tricked for money after exiting the theater from a hollywood movie and if you have ever felt that way too heed my warning stay miles away from this movie
i thought hedy burress who managed to escape from the watery grave of part one was going to be in part guess not i just think they should of killed her off like in friday the th part you know what i mean this movie like scream and urban legend followed movies within a movie this was pure crap the whole movie within a movie crap bad stay away
this film is horrible bad acting bad writing bad music it s just horrible not only is it incredibly misrepresentative of role playing games but the key elements of the film are poorly executed may the god i don t believe in have mercy on the souls of the miserable wretches who conceived and gave birth to this abomination
this movie had a lot of blood in it when the sabretooth attack it also i loved it when that guy and the women were having some good time and then the sabretooth attacked the women and ate her stomach and took the liver out that was the best and the ton sabretooth walking on its front legs hilarious to make this movie better more action and less talking if you know what i mean and also please please people who made this movie don t make anothwer movie like this movies ending cause it was terrible sabretooth alive and killed that women in the end this movie reminds me of the grudges ending always there s enemy left ok damn it this movie sucks i can t believe it i loved it when my lil bro got freaked from the attacks stomach takin out and the blood ya
heavily re edited and often confusing the original screen version of man on fire was at least ten years out of date when it was made and the passing years haven t made it any better this is the kind of movie that producers with too much money and too little experience make to get attention and everyone else does just to pay off their outstanding alimony or their drug dealer with scott glenn s bodyguard going out on a limb to rescue his year old charge the kidnapped daughter of a wealthy italian family an interesting cast joe pesci brooke adams danny aiello jonathan pryce have all done better the action is sluggish and sparse and only john scott s exceptionally fine score part of which turned up in the last reel of die hard makes a positive impression one case where the remake made by tony scott the original choice of director for this version is an improvement
i was expecting a lot better from the battlestar galactica franchise very boring prequel to the main series after the first minutes i was waiting for it to end the characters do a lot of talking about religion computers programming retribution etc there are gangsters mafia types who carry out hits however caprica doesn t have the action of the original series to offset the slower parts let me give you some helpful advice when viewing movies as a general rule if there is a lot of excessive exploitive titillation then you know the movie will be a dud caprica has lots of this the director writer usually attempts to compensate for his poor abilities by throwing in a few naked bodies it never works and all it does is demean the very young actresses involved and i feel sorry for them directors writers who do this should be banned from the business if you want to be bored for an hour and a half by all means rent caprica there s free porn on the net if you really want to see naked bodies otherwise move along nothing to see here
this third darkman was definitely better than the second one but still far worse than the original movie what made this one better than d was the fact that the bad guy had been changed and durant was not brought back again furthermore there was actually some hint of character development when it came to the bad guy s family and darkman himself this made my heart soften and i gave this flick as much as i e
wait don t tell me they threw out the movie and kept the out takes you know this movie could have been shot in a back alley in new york the gangster bangster i guess gangster rap designer gangster duster clothes including the kerchief which somehow got moved from the neck for protection from the dust storms to the head i guess it was to protect the head from the heat filtering through the k mart hats budget rent a horsie it seems supplied the horsies the one bedroom scene where the girl was talking and the guy was mouthing her words i though it was him talking you know watching this movie just confirms that it isn t about the acting anymore its about looks and it s about the money couldn t have been too much of that where this movie is concerned well all in all i think that this movie will go down as the all time worst movie ever made just one more thing though where was ice t did he finally get to go on oprah
this is easily the worst presley vehicle ever which would bring us pretty close to the worst film ever made it is measurably worse than even the revolting happy ending song at the end of it happened at the world s fair and here i thought that moment when elvis buys all of the vendor s balloons for his girl and then the balloon vendor gets jiggy to the marching band was the epitome of bad cinema and could not be topped i usually enjoy the random elvis flick if for no other reason but the memories of a time when we were innocent enough to sit through it this one however ought to be called live a little wish you were dead a little and makes stay away joe look like olivier playing othello here elvis plays greg who is essentially a hippie free lance photographer except for the establishment haircut after a fun morning of reckless driving he ends up at the beach where he is abducted by a woman who s name changes depending on the scene and who is speaking to her clearly michele carey was selected for her resemblance to and ability to mimic elizabeth taylor if i watched this without my glasses i would have thought it was late s liz playing the female lead she sics her dog on elvis until he runs into the water and catches convenient movie pneumonia then she keeps him doped up out of consciousness in her beach pad so long he loses his job and his apartment so she moves his stuff into her house before he awakens without even telling him the audience does not know about it either until elvis tries to go back to work and his boss has him beaten up for no reason except he deserved it for making this movie and tries to go home and finds some hateful woman in a slip living in his house rather than having her arrested for kidnapping larceny and assault he goes out and gets two jobs to repay the back rent miss crazy pants had to spring for when stealing all of his belongings job one is working for don porter at a playboy type magazine job two is upstairs working for rudy vallee at a snobby fashion magazine i think the two job shuffling is supposed to be the comedy too bad it isn t the least bit funny unless you d laugh the th time you saw someone run up and down stairs in fast motion to silly music the predominate obstacle that keeps greg from falling for his abductor is her other love interest the dreadfully miscast dick sargent let s face it either porter or vallee even given their advanced ages in would have made far more believable competitors for miss crazy s affections there are a variety of uninteresting and unfunny twists and turns i kept waiting for something anything to happen that would make all of this make sense it never did entertainment totals approximately three minutes and is comprised of elvis rendition of a little less talk which i can listen to on cd without this painful movie inflicted upon me and a funny five second bit where elvis flops on the couch and crazy pants has apparently disassembled it so it flies all to pieces when he lands on it that s it folks busted furniture the only laugh in this entire film no amount of mod sixties clothing music or d cor can salvage this high heaven stinker and it should be avoided at all costs viewing this can create an unnatural desire on the part of the audience toward the self infliction of grave bodily harm
this is ostensibly a movie about multiple grief as such it ought to move viewers and make them empathetic with the plight of the main characters however its irritatingly postmodern style makes it almost incomprehensible the camera continually switches from one scene to another from one personal crisis to the next creating a choppy disjointed effect most characters appear to live aimless unstructured lives held together by their professional commitments it also stretches credibility that a man who has just been given what amounts to a likely death sentence would cheerfully indulge in a sex romp with a woman he has just met the storyline if there is a storyline is difficult to follow in sum the overall effect is rather disappointing in spite of all that the acting is generally good and some of the scenes are quite powerful
this is the absolute worst movie i have ever seen there was absolutely nothing good to say about this movie i have seen some bad movies but this one takes it there is no plot and most of the movie you are either fast forwarding the movie to get it done faster or you are wondering what the hell is going on because you can t seriously think that someone thought of this movie and you are watching it i feel sorry for anyone who has to sit through this painful hour and a half please take my advice and do not watch this movie for i know you will think it is the biggest waste of time you have ever spent in your life
i came away from this movie with the feeling that it could have been so much better instead of what should be a gripping tense story of a boy s fight for survival in the wilderness it comes off as a national geographic documentary meets columbia sportswear ad the film begins with brian jared rushton preparing for a journey by plane to see his father his mother fortuitously gives him the curious choice of a hatchet as a going away gift what s wrong with a rubik s cube little knowing how badly he will soon need it once in the air the plane s pilot a blink and you ll miss him cameo by ned beatty suffers a fatal heart attack leaving brian helpless as the plane crashes into a lake extremely lucky to walk or rather swim away virtually unscathed brian must find shelter food and hope for rescue here is where the main problem with the movie begins by the very nature of brian s solitude jared has very few lines to speak and so the film ought to have compensated by ratcheting up the tension of each scene instead he is shown walking around sitting around and so on with only a minimal sense of danger as a result too much reliance is placed on flashbacks to the parents troubled marriage as the source of tension these scenes merely get in the way and don t particularly add much to the story even worse occasionally jared his face covered with mud lets out a primal scream or two which conjures up unfortunate parallels to predator speaking of unfortunate we could have done with being spared the sight of his mullet but it presumably helped keep him warm at night another disappointment is pamela sue martin in a totally ineffectual performance as the mother both she and the father have very little impact in the movie for instance we are never shown how they react to news of brian s disappearance how they might be organizing rescue attempts and so on this is just one source of tension the film makers would have done well to explore instead of spending so much time on events that happened before brian embarked on his journey
spoilers below cabin fever has my nod for worst film of the year that i ve seen that is this movie is straight garbage there is so much wrong with the film you can t help but be amazed at how bad it really is this movie had so much potential to be good but ultimately made nothing of it the characters were as dumb as one can be for the entire movie you re just asking yourself why would you do that or what s your point in doing this this is how illogical and stupid the characters are we get no background into them so naturally you really don t give a rats as about their fate you could only laugh at their stupidity the slut marcy for instance was she that horny that she had to sleep with paul rider strong there was no point in that its almost as if the filmmakers needed a excuse to give her the virus so voila ugh would anyone really go into the woods and drink water from the faucet of a cabin without looking at it first why didn t bert just shoot the sick guy from the start movie would ve been over that way besides they ended up killing him anyway why did it take them so long to finally decide to leave the cabin even if they had to walk no i ll just wait until of my friends are infected one a blink away from death to finally opt to walk outta there what was exactly the reasoning behind paul s attempt to fish out the body of the hermit only to fall in the contaminated reservoir and get infected with the virus pure stupidity i swear common sense was not a friend much less an aquaintance to these idiots i don t think there has ever been a worse ending to a movie in the beginning the kids ask the hick store cashier what the rifle was for and he replied that its for the niggers in the end of the film young blacks dressed in baggy clothes one of them in a du rag no less go into the store come to find out that the cashier was cleaning it for them to be used for hunting then he proceeds to give them all pounds and handshakes and joke around with them as if they re his homeboys okay what the hell was the point of that how tasteless can one be what were the filmmakers thinking putting that in the movie i as a black man was of course offended by the initial nigger comment it was a tasteless pointless remark my question to the filmmakers what was the point of the ending with the black kids was that to force me to forget about the initial racist comment made earlier to smooth things over with black viewers by making a joke out of it well i for one did not find that pathetic attempt at humor funny in the least bit the whole movie was a joke a pathetic attempt at filmmaking that shouldn t be given the time of day peter jackson really thought this film was that good what film was he looking at zero out of stars if i could give it a lower rating i would please fellow imdb ers don t waste hours of your precious life watching this abomination of a movie this is one of the worst movies i ve ever seen
do you like stand up then stay away from this during the early rounds there are in fact good comics but unless they got some cute qualities they got a snowballs chance any controversial material and you are out and i think i hurt as much as the discarded comedians when i see who the crooked judges are letting in out of my top made it further than the preliminaries half of the finalists have given me laughs several of them have lifted their material elsewhere something the judges doesn t seem to have problems with it is more entertaining than a lot of what else is on tv but incredibly hard to watch without contemplating what it could have been if the producers changed the name of the contest to last clown standing all my criticism would loose validity maybe an idea
i liked how this started out featuring some decent special effects especially for a film years old there was some pretty impressive scenery however the film bogs down fairly early on with some very dumb dialog as the males all try to flirt with anne francis altaira morbius viewing this in the s after a long absence it was fun to see francis again an actress who has done mostly television shows since this film was released and is still acting it also was interesting to see a young looking leslie nielsen dr john j adams who i wouldn t have recognized had it not been for this voice i watched half of this movie before the boredom came almost overwhelming and i had a strong desire to go to sleep i appreciated them re doing this vhs tape in stereo but it was a weak effort this is one those overrated film where elites think is so heavy and thought provoking that s nonsense it only appeared intelligent because the rest of the s sci fi films were so stupid some if the early scenes would have looked great on wideescreen which i didn t have at the time of this writing perhaps another look this time on the widescreen transfer would make me change this review
i cant understand at all why so many godzilla fans think this is excellent one of the best godzilla films ever in fact this film is horrible and one of the very few gojira films i cant stand to watch again the other being g vs megalon the plot is too campy to be in the heisei series a series that attempted to turn the aging godzilla franchise into bonafide action films revolving around ideas that seemed more in place in than it just sounded ridiculous especially with some of the subject matter take for example the ww scene with the japanese soldiers praising a dying godzillasaurus a mournful and serious tone take the exuberant former commander turn capitalist and his death serious seens in a film its fans somehow denote as played for laughs as a goofy romp with guilty illogical fun if so than this is easily one of the most tasteless films i ve seen however i think its more likely it was only talent the filmmakers lacked and this was a case of a straight faced action movie gone bad it was made ever worse by the fact that the special effects are terrible beyond compare from the jet packs to the android to the hokey sound effects emitted from everything its impossible to take anything seriously and yet the film expects you to there s no nudges to the camera like nearly all godzilla films there s a pointless romance and this is no exception though something can be said about the fact that this one is especially pointless since and inexplicable there is literally no reason at all presented for the romance it just happens and there lives make degree commitments for it aside from this the other terrible aspect of this film is dialogue both the japanese and english is horrible clunky and possibly the inspiration for battlefield earth the tristar dvd compounds the problems making everything look grainy blurred dim and just plain ugly the same was for the sound i first saw the japanese region version and the differences are night and day with the original vibrant colors and texture the noteworthy score the fight scenes especially are actually watchable in my opinion the heisei series is a disappointment with the exception of godzilla japanese version there is little to praise here and godzilla vs king ghidorah is case in point of this failure it doesn t even come close to deserving the reputation and fans it gets out of
hi everyone if you saw singing in the rain you remember the scene of gene kelly dancing in the rain you also remember the dance number of donald o connor make em laugh if you saw royal wedding you will remember fred astaire dancing on the ceiling if you saw jailhouse rock you will even remember the title dance number choreographed by the king himself that is what is missing here there could have been some blockbuster dance numbers in this presentation the closest was chuck mcgowan s i can do that the mere fact that you have some talented people on stage moving together does not make a great dance film richard attenborough was to blame for this failure he pointed the camera at the stage and thought that would be a good thing yelling at people auditioning for a part in a broadway production is not entertainment michael douglas would be just as badly cast if he were in a western or a comedy he is ok when he is in a michael douglas movie where we see him yelling at someone we would like to yell at it does not work here the cast was good except for michael of course a good movie could have been made even using the songs that were in the stage production but someone should have thought about how to film it next time they do one of these i hope they call me first tom willett
spoken like a true hard boiled u an gangsta the story is no worse than any number of gangster flicks but never ever confuse this movie with the godfather i or ii or goodfellas it is not in the same league but what makes the film periodically painful to watch is all these italian americans swaggering around dropping bad gangsta lines in an even worse fake u an accent pacino would have been great if they could just have dubbed him i was looking forward to see abrahams and loggia but their steenky accents spoiled the fun ah well the script ain t too hot either don corleone would have made this disappear five minutes after meeting him smiling and patting him on the back all the while
i love a good sappy love story and i m a guy but when i rented love story i prayed for the end to come as quickly and painlessly as possible and just the opposite for ali mcgraw s character ali mcgraw as jenny alienated and irritated the heck out of me within the first minutes when we learn that she has been diagnosed with a life threatening illness i couldn t help but wonder if her death would be such a terrible loss for poor oliver or if anyone watching this film would even care if she didn t die her grating personality would probably have pushed oliver over the edge and eventually landed them in divorce court people love this movie but it s one of the worst of the s
this may have been made for the hell of it but it was most probably the worst film i ve seen in years the best thing about the entire dvd would be the case i m surprised that people took the time to make something so rubbish and yet spend money on it too i m glad i only rented i suppose the real fans of this film would probably have to be sadistic and gothic to care about it without taking in any cgi or any other effects for that matter i hope alex chandon learnt a lesson about lighting and sfx to make a better film in the future that is if he is still in work notes to buyers this is extremely disappointing don t buy it
i really didn t expect much from this film seeing as it has people from parkersburg wv which is were i live acting in it this town is dull and so is this film there were a few decent scened in the movie but i was distracted by all the crappy landmarks they made a point to show this movie may have been good if there was actual acting in it but there wasn t any unless you are from parkersburg and are interested in seeing what you see everyday then stay away from this movie the dialog will put you to sleep the acting will bore you to tears and steven soderberg should lose some credibility after shooting crap like this its a predictable movie with no surprises what you see is what you get and that is a minute tour of parkersburg west virginia and belpre ohio without a narrator
every sunday a trio of buds get together at a nyc diner to boast about their sexual conquests of the night before sometimes they re joined by a newlywed ex comrade and hoochie hunter who hangs on them like a puling barnacle they re unabashed horn dogs corn dogs and mia who witnesses them on the prowl decides that they need to be taught a lesson dammit ergo she ll date and dump why not all three of them gasp what a wild idea what a radical naughty gal women now have the right to date and sleep around as much as they want to as much as men do even there is one solitary laughable element in whipped namely the fact that not once during the amigo s detailed discussions of their bodily functions and the tantric talents of the bed partners they trash do the other customers in the diner turn around and say dude we re trying to eat here indeed a heh heh gag has an older lady eagerly weigh in on the useful sexual properties of certain beverages a big fat kermit the frog sheesh to that it s truly unfortunate that a buddy movie with a great setting a smart cute heroine and three possible pairings had to have such a cop out ending p s whip oosh sound effects to the screenwriter for use of the phrase you go girl it was tired in and it s tired now save your time and watch some sex and the city reruns
that is the only thing i can positive to say about this movie cleveland is the star i ve been there and never saw the city look this good beautiful river and cityscapes this movie moves ahead at such a pace they hope you won t notice the lack of real world relevance people running around and shooting guns without any consequence for example there is a shoot out at rob lowe s character s house two cars are stolen and yet the cops don t show up there till much later in the movie murder for hire never looked so implausible whoever wrote this movie should be on the receiving end of one the movies countless stray bullets many of the actors in this movie are so much better than this i check the date of the movie just to make sure it wasn t written during the writers strike but alas this was not the case this movie is currently in rotation on universal s hd channel unless you want to drool of over lowe there is no reason to watch it
dynasty revisited in hawaii full of clich s highly predictable unrealistic and sometimes even stupid if you have nothing better to do however it does provide minutes of simple unpretensive entertainment endless looks at great male and female muscles and very good photography of the spectacular hawaiian scenery on the other hand if you are looking for anything more than that stay away oh and by the way if you have ever worked in a hotel or know anything about running one you have two options you will feel sick every two minutes at the sheer stupidity and silliness of how the show presents hotel business or look at it as science fiction comedy as i did lie back relax and laugh about it
i ended up watching this movie before even going through any of the reviews on the request of a female just out of curiosity i thought let me find out if there are people who actually recommend others to watch this movie i am quite shocked to find such long and positive reviews on this website that makes me conclude that it s a scam as far as my opinion goes i have to ask are these filmmakers retarded or do they assume that the viewers are retarded the movie is atrocious on so many levels and i m not even talking about the story or presentation so these bunch of guys plus one girl the lead actress form a music band guessing from the constant presence of guitars it is supposed to be a rock band hell when did dancers started becoming the part of a rock band anyway let me accept it as the bollywood version of a rock band but amusingly enough all the scores which actually had these two guitarists doing all kinds of cool rock gestures and i am assuming they were playing the instruments the sound of the guitar was completely missing i simply can t comprehend the magnitude of stupidity here i am just going to conclude here because it is absolutely not worth pointing out any further flaws in the movie bollywood directors seem to have no shame anymore
i was watching this with one of my friends who is a vampire freak and i was extremely disgusted at the fact that this film exists this film should be shown to prisoners of war yes it s that bad even john mccain wouldn t be able to sit through this so why the rating because it had a vampire midget come on what s more entertaining than a vampire midget there s one scene in this film where john savage gets laid by saying i want to feel human again and the chick being the brainless stripper slut she is lets him feel human i wish i could feel human with jessica alba or megan fox this is a movie for stoners there is bright flashy objects and random movements all in all don t waste your money on this garbage i got it for free when i was walking down the street with my friend and we saw a garbage barrel full of video tapes and a sign that said free so in a way i didn t get ripped off but still
if you re the kind of movie goer who enjoys original content and intelligent suspense then look elsewhere kids cause sleepwalkers really sucks usually i m more eloquent than that but wow this was bad i especially love it when charles offers tanya a ride home she declines and then he is seen walking home where s his car anyway just don t see it folks i really want to be more specific but words escape me cats jumping on people a guy getting stabbed by corn cheesey lines up the proverbial wazoo just don t see it wait i take that back see it for writer stephen king s cameo as the guy who owns the graveyard he s actually pretty good even with guest appearances by mark hamill and ron perlman king gives the best performance of the film but other than that wow bad
when great director actor combinations are talked about the team of j lee thompson and charles bronson is not usually mentioned probably because the output of nine joint ventures between the two of them runs the gamut from the really good action entertainment to the mediocre unfortunately kinjite forbidden subjects falls in the latter that s sad because kinjite could have been a whole lot better but for the life of me i don t understand why it was necessary to make the father of the missing japanese girl a guy used to getting some cheap jollies because the romance in his marriage has run out that might have been good for another film altogether but it served no purpose here a straightforward cop drama with charles bronson as a vice cop who s seen a bit too much in his line of work and has a strong prejudice against orientals that part could also have used a little explaining as well but he s going to have to overcome it if he and patient partner perry lopez are going to locate a captured japanese school girl bronson s time in the vice squad have told him exactly where to look for the kidnapper a stylish murderous pimp played by jaime fernandez is the guy and he and bronson have some history in fact in the film s best scene bronson made him eat an expensive rolex watch and set his car on fire at one point fernandez happens to spot bronson and lopez in an all night delicatessen and this being after his rolex snack he sprays the place with an uzi killing everyone but bronson and lopez i really think that little incident would have had more than a couple vice cops from the lapd after fernandez but that s another terribly big hole in the plot still there is a very rough justice in the end for fernandez i wish the whole film had been better though this was the last film of the bronson thompson team and j lee thompson s last as a director he should have gone out with something better
back in his youth the old man had wanted to marry his first cousin but his family forbid it many decades later the old man has raised three children two boys and one girl and allows his son and daughter to marry and have children soon the sister is bored with brother and jumps in the bed of brother one might think that the three siblings are stuck somewhere on a remote island but no they are upper class europeans going to college and busy in the social world never do we see a flirtatious moment between any non related female and the two brothers never do we see any flirtatious moment between any non related male and the one sister all flirtatious moments are shared between only between the brothers and sister the weakest part of gladiator was the incest thing the young emperor commodus would have hundreds of slave girls and a city full of marriage minded girls all over him but no he only wanted his sister if movie incest is your cup of tea then sunshine will slowly thrill you to no end
for domestic audiences i can see how they would applaud this movie for outsiders with no vested interests it did not make much sense the germans were portrayed as incompetents and the russians as heroes the supposedly romantic angle was superfluous and a distraction how a young woman could love the lieutenant from just glimpsing him was nonsense how she could as mentioned at the end of the movie never marry just because of this infatuation was beyond me i mentioned the germans were portrayed as idiots and that was exemplified in the chase into the marsh several hundred german troops advanced pushing the russians into the marsh so the russians hid and the germans stopped at the edge of the marsh and just stood there listening i suppose they did not want to get their boots wet but i am sure an officer would have ordered or men into the water to search the marsh but that would have ended the story also the germans entered the barn where the russians were hiding in the loft and did not bother to fire into the roof at the worst some soldier would have tossed a grenade into the loft and not climbed a ladder to peer in i did see some reviewers who said they cried at the end i wonder why you knew this small band would perish and they was nothing heart tugging in that
from the moment christopher lee puts on a pair of punk sunglasses and tries to sneak into a punk rock club you know you ve got a stinker on your hands this film had potential beneath all of the sludge there are the remnants of what could have been crafted into a decent film if not an interesting one the final product is a real mess however aside from the gratuitous nudity and some very attractive women howling ii winds up being a laughable excuse for a horror film christopher lee gives it a nugget of credibility but even he cannot raise it above the level of crap having never seen any of the other films in this series this critic will be forced to accept on face value that this is a genuine continuation of the events in part one we start off at a funeral for one of the characters from the original and within the first ten minutes we find ourselves in transylvania with a small group of heroes ready to battle a coven of werewolves the film is paced fairly well and there are not too many dead spots the action is there it just isn t filmed well one bright spot is the music of a punk band called babel though their song is played quite often it is rather catchy the problems with this film are great in number first off the acting is worse than pitiful christopher lee is good enough but that s where it ends the two leads reb brown and annie mcenroe are lacking in just about everything you d want for such characters the writing is wretched the editing redundant and the direction amateurish there are a couple nice special effect gimmicks but the cheesy ones far out weigh them in number sybil danning is nice to look at but her acting performance is less than satisfactory judd omen looks the part he plays but his voice and acting are unconvincing to say the least much of the dialog is in an unintelligible language that may or may not be latin i liked the general idea for the story i always enjoy stories of true believers out to battle seemingly invincible forces of evil one scene where a small group of good guys are trekking through a dark forest and shooting down a bunch of werewolves is even kind of exciting kind of maybe a bigger budget or a better director could have made the rest of the film a bit more compelling of stars the hound side note as of this writing the censors at youtube com have still not taken down the ending credits with sybil danning ripping off her top several times while the babel song is playing catch it while you can
i watched this today partially attracted to the all star cast and partly because i have enjoyed so many other films of this ilk however this is one to avoid there are dozens of badly cut scenes where the continuity just does not flow the billiards challenge at the start for example the fighting scenes with the natives are about as good as you would remember in those old black and white tarzan movies you know where you see a spear fly through the air and camera cuts to a dead native lying motionless on the floor with it sticking from his thigh is that instantaneous death there are also several quite unnecessary scenes which have nothing to do with the plot like the little girl being rescued while collecting flowers the really badly animated clay toys are too painful to watch if you do see this movie the crabs which inch forward at about kph are the highlight somehow one manages to creep up on david mccullum and give him a nip its as if there was no time to get out of the way like when the obelisk in the city falls over the native has all the time in the world to take a step to the left but no he screams and it falls on him i only give this a because of ekland and why does mccullums voice develop a stutter as the movie progresses
there are a couple of prior comments here which opine about this flick s abundance of clich s throughout and i agree completely both with regard to the characters and the dialog i d read about elizabeth berkly s awful performance in the equally awful showgirls which i ve never seen and her performance here while not awful is barely up to the standards of lifetime s worse fare there was not a hint of depth to her character but then there probably shouldn t have been if so it would have placed the film completely out of balance since there wasn t a hint of depth or charisma not a trace in any one character performer or portrayal the principal s handling of liz s initial complaint after her tutee had kissed her in the hall was laughable her husband s initial reaction and advice were likewise forrest gump attacking jenny s boyfriend in his car provided a more realistic intelligent action and hell he was mentally challenged the smarmy unctuous lawyer excuse the redundancy father of the lying student actually performed something probably worthy of praise in his performance he was both laughable and thoroughly annoying at the same time no mean feat her attorney was more of an insensitive nerd also not unknown in the profession finally and frankly i rather enjoyed this part the police were such a collection of insensitive oafs that you d rather depend upon barney fife without andy to handle all law enforcement and investigation in your community i know that most real like cops fall a bit short of the sharpness intelligence and empathy of the level displayed by most characters on the law and order series and the like but dolts of this level seem to be a staple on lifetime finally i found a kind of story within a story fascination with josh s concoction of his being the victim of his teacher this scripted performance within the story was even worse than his overall performance in the main story this was something of an achievement like going from f to f minus this whole lame situation should have been resolved in real life in about minutes following a realistic meeting between teacher and school authorities with husband involved but then that would have precluded the contrived drama following and left an hour s blank film in the camera but the writer s here proved with their ending they could do even worse when the situation was finally resolved and righted this was accomplished in all of about seconds with no indication of what measures might have been forthcoming in any real world context for the perpetrator and his parents or whether they might have been able to find some sort of path toward redemption this one s a presentation the second because it does have some mild fascination
from the critical acclaim i expected more from this movie and from tamara jenkins the story just meandered along and didn t seem to have a point or a plot and i find it hard to believe that a year old girl mature for her age or no would be so blase about getting the loss of her virginity over with maybe i am too young to relate i was four years old in but i didn t have any problems connecting with the stories of shakespeare in love or life is beautiful and i wasn t alive for either of those settings the cast is very good but unfortunately for them the script did not alow them to engage the audience overall slums had its moments but unless you are yearning to reminisce over halter tops and tube socks i would say skip this one
decent animation and some workable character development keep this animated horse fable from dreamworks at least watchable however it remains somewhat slow paced and the storyline is a bit on the silly side it is interesting to see a reversal of the typical cowboys and indian roles but here it just seems like a nod to political correctness rather than a proper storyline decision grade c
william cooke and paul talbot share director writer credit for this entertaining low budget film about three boys camping out in the woods with their horror magazines feet propped up by the fire and schoolboy banter back and forth and a scroungy town tramp named ralph gunnar hansen of leatherface fame wanders over and trades four tales of gore in return for food and the warmth of the fire one tale is the old retread of the hook two teens on lover s lane attacked by a demented killer with a hook for a hand another story has a couple of tokers needing to score some weed they stumble upon a guy that knows a guy that has some great s t as they smoke a couple of bags full their skin begins to turn gray and green before it bubbles up and falls off one of the better stories is about an unhappy man returning home for christmas who can t wait for his mother to drop dead and enjoys telling his nephew and niece about satan claus the fourth campfire tale is of a greedy sailor that washes ashore upset about an empty treasure chest and ends up being chased out to sea by zombies without a big budget for special effects campfire tales gets the point across and really could have been a lot worse a bit corny but fun to watch except for maybe the sailor tale the acting is understandably not award worthy cast members include tres holton courtney ballard h ray york johnny tamblyn walter kaufmann kevin draine david avin and paul kaufmann
never saw the original movie in the series i only hope it was a much better movie than this or the sequel made in the s as if it is not how were these two terrible sequels even justified this movie had a really good lead in when they were advertising it to be shown on one of those old independent stations that are a thing of the past now anyways it looked like it would be a pretty good scary movie it was however a movie that would make some walt disney movies look dark really this movie was just a bunch of light fluff with virtually no boggy creek creature to be seen the only real sighting is near the end when you see its shape during a very heavy rainstorm other than that there is virtually no sign of the creature which was really disappointing as a kid the story is basically the old evil hunters must kill anything they see and are after the boggy creek creature and kids are out to help it or just some random hairy guy in the woods that likes to pull random boats through the water not really worth watching i would however like to see the original granted the maker of that would make the also bad boggy creature of the s but he also made a very good slasher movie in the s the town the dreaded sundown
i remember the days in which kim basinger was nothing more than a pretty face who adorned movies with typical characters of dumb blondie romantic interest or damsel in danger but everything changed when she won an academy award as best supporting actress for her role in the excellent movie l a confidential and i think i was not the only one who was surprised by her solid performance however after that moment her career did not follow the ideal path sure the prestige she won thanks to that movie made her to participate on moderately prestigious movies like people i know or the door in the floor but we have never seen her again on a substantial character the movie while she was out does nothing to put her on that situation and it is not only that her character is not too tasty but also that the movie is really crappy the screenplay from this movie could not be more hollow and basic however basinger brings some conviction to her character and that makes this poor movie to win a few points this movie is full of clich s and generic villains the work of director susan montford is truly disastrous for many reasons but mainly because the movie never gets a good rhythm and tone the ending from this movie is extremely ridiculous i do not recommend while she was out at all this film commits the capital sin of being boring
as a horror movie fan i try to watch all significant novelties of this genre especially those which are the products of my native cinema and i can say that that the power of fear or vedma as the russian title of it is one of the weakest film among them firstly it can t scary even a little kid it paces so slowly and so predictable that there is no place for the real horror frankly speaking it s bad in all points from the goofy plot i don t know why the russian producers director decided to transform the classic story about ukrainian witchcraft into some lame and ridiculous modern day america thriller i absolutely agree with the previous reviewer it doesn t thrill a bit and to the terrible and cheesy actors work all actors including the leading valeri nikolayev and yevgeniya kryukova who are quite famous in russia look like wooden dolls or something like that and it seems to me they didn t even bother to play at all only spoke their english lines without any expression and at the end i don t really understand why they filmed this flick in english with russian actors i think it was their wrong turn at least they could cast some american or english actors for the leading parts to make them look more convincing the same i can say about so called small american town backgrounds which were shot in estonia and look like it the only positive moment i found in the power of fear is the visual effects they are not excellent but rather good for the russian film and the music is ok at least it doesn t irritate me that s why i give it two stars overall if you want to see good horror film don t waste your time and money on this boring flick and if you are looking for something that claims to be a russian horror i d advise you to find a copy of viy or the spirit of evil it s really the terrific movie based on the same novel as power of fear but much much better
the acting was bad the script was bad and the ending was just terrible the only good comment i could make about this movie would be the special effects and make up but apart from that this movie would be one of the worst movies of why on earth did they have to remake such a perfect movie and ruin it why
this film has its share of negative comments and i have to agree with those who consider it one of the worst movies ever made true most of the films based on the works of king are pretty bad but this one goes beyond bad into the realm of horrible there is not one scary moment in it unless you consider stupidity scary it is typical king garbage myths twisted around that made no sense in the first place mixed with obvious and belabored so called scares that are about as shocking as peewee s playhouse which at least is entertaining it is full of ridiculous moments not the least of which is alice krige s character when she goes on a rampage and starts quipping like the villain in an old batman tv show it is so absurd as to be sickening all the people who had cameos in this including john landis are lucky they still have careers but the most absurd part has to be the cat costumes towards the end which look like cheap rubber outfits someone bought at k mart the best part of the movie is the appearance of some real cats who actually out act the people in the movie
well i don t know what people saw in this movie i don t know i saw this movie yesterday and i got a severe headache other than few good dialog there is nothing in this movie the big b rt now is preaching to fall in love with girls of half of you age i didn t like the movie at all i wanted to give rating but giving as i like the role of the small girl who is called sexy by ab my word dont watch save your self donot watch this movie save time and money
most definitely the worst columbo ever dreamt up no murder and the abandonment of the tried and tested formula makes this a real drag falk looks bored throughout and so will you be if you waste anytime watching this
a little girl s dead body is found stripped of all possible means of identification when it is discovered that one leg is longer than the other it is assumed to be the body of a couple s missing daughter after this trauma the couple separates and the mother becomes addicted to tranquilizers and leads a miserable existence all of this changes when one day many years later she receives a phone call from her daughter with the help of an ex cop and a reporter she sets out on a journey to determine if her daughter is indeed alive los sin nombre is a mess plot wise moves at an achingly slow pace and is completely unscary the saving grace is emma vilarasau who does an outstanding job as the desperate mother the best part of the movie is the ending but i m not sure it is worth enduring the rest of the film beware of the english subtitles on the recent r release they aren t very accurate
someone mentioned editing this is edited badly and what started out as somewhat intriguing became an incomprehensible mess for starters let us know what it is you are trying to do with these experiments why are these people the best choices for the type of experimenting they are involved in and what exactly are they testing apparently there is some grand plan that some agency is going to exploit the acting is pretty bad everyone is emoting everyone is keeping secrets they frequently mention that if it weren t for the money they d hang it up there s a deranged minister who spouts scripture on and on but again the biggest hang up is the lack of laying out a playing field for the actors there are some really cheesy elements those little rooms and those chaise lounges the awful wallpaper was it wallpaper it was interesting but didn t seem to go anywhere
sure we all like bad movies at one time or another and we in fact enjoy them this however wasn t even a guilty pleasure it was just crap some guy vince offer who is conceited enough to make himself the main character while probably got drunk high probably both and thought it was a great idea to make a movie he then proceeded to show his script to equally high drunk individuals overall this movie was so bad predictable and unoriginal i couldn t get through minutes of it before i turned it off it makes you got served look like citizen kane bat man wtf some guy that walks around with a bat real original almost as good as calling him fat man and having a fat guy walk around in a superhero outfit
cecil b demille s parlor to prison tearjerker manslaughter finds the lovely leatrice joy as a good at heart but decadent young lady with more money than she knows what to do with her recklessness leads to imprisonment which in turn leads to her regeneration thomas meighan is the crusading district attorney who has made it his personal crusade to bring out the goodness and wholesomeness in lydia joy but he gets sidetracked by alcohol and once she is released it is up to her to rescue him if the plot doesn t sound too bad you ll be floored by the woeful presentation the quality of demille s direction is very low and he does not show any particular skill that is unique to him the photography is standard and flat and the editing is hardly more dynamic one could easily classify it as a fashion show and be pretty correct demille gets to dress miss joy up in so many different types of clothes evening gowns golfing costumes motoring costumes piles of furs that it s subtitle could be fashions of one thing more disappointing than the photography or editing or the direction is the acting which is mostly flat and wooden when it is not it is merely routine silent gesturing rolling eye balls twitching eye brows and deliberate pointing and arm movements what would have been enlivened for modern viewers by mugging and scene chewing of some of the worst silent films is here merely dull to watch the only member of the cast who succeeds in any form of excellence is lois wilson who is not only beautiful but is able to play her role naturally she is convincing and endearing in tearful close ups as long as you don t read the moralizing title card that follows once she opens her mouth to speak like i said everybody else is droningly routine joy meighan even julia faye her performance here makes a good argument for why she never attained true stardom the worst and most amusing part of this movie is the heavy moralistic tone that carries through all of it meighan s character has plenty of intertitles where he drones on about how the youth of america is declining in it s moral stance and going right back to the decadence of rome insert absurd flashback this movie s moralizing has been described as victorian but it s further than that it has so little bearing in reality that i have a feeling audiences at that time didn t take it any more seriously than modern viewers could this movie is exactly what the unknowing tend to think of as a typical silent movie with it s archaic moral structure wooden acting and bad direction demille shows that he could be a terrible director with no sense of pacing camera placement or skill in handling either script or actors i can t imagine anybody in their right mind taking it seriously boring slow and idiotic i recommend it to hardcore silent movie dorks like myself only
i wanted to watch this movie but one bizarre ridiculous scene after another forced me to shut it off character s don t seem to react to anything consider this heath ledger is walking a night through a cemetery i believe when he is attacked by spirits which he drives away once past this ordeal he calmly walks away and meets up with a friend that saw it all when asked what happen he says blandly attacked by demons nothing serious as if this is only a little more exciting than a flat tire i shut it off when they go to ask something a demon or something i stopped caring a ques ion the answer can only be rented out of someone with the energy of their death and the priest watch in what appears to be vague annoyance as a man is strung up and hung and they ask his thrashing dying body question out of stars
one note comedy that probably sets modern day feminists teeth on edge department store clerk betsy drake is in love with the idea of babies and marriage pinning her hopes on women s magazines until she spies super bait in the form of sleek bachelor cary grant the rest of the film plods from one ploy to the next as the relentless drake pursues her quarry i guess the word perky just about sum s up drake s approach to the role she does have a charming smile but after minutes of memorizing her dentures i began to overdose grant s role is basically secondary and minus his usual flair there is one scene however that almost salvages this slender exercise drake queries the hapless grant following his lecture to a roomful of respectable ladies here her perky manner has an unforced freshness that is really quite remarkable and had the production not rubbed our noses in that upbeat grin for minutes the film might have amounted to more than a girls camp day dream circa
saw this film recently and have to say it was the worst attempt at film making i have ever had the misfortune to see what the hell was going on with coolio totally unprovoked shooting at people in distress totally uninvolving slow tedious and detached worse than spawn long live evil dead ii
i don t know what it was about this film that made me react so viscerally against it perhaps it was the characters who so unlikable and were not compelling enough to care about perhaps it was the disorganized storyline perhaps it was the fact that rob lowe wore a long dangly earring and eyeliner perhaps it was because at some point in the movie they all break out in song perhaps it was because the s were never that s perhaps it was because everything was a garish hyperbole perhaps it was because a character pumps his fist while driving away from the camera during a fade out i don t know what it was that made me hate it so but if it means trying to watch it again i m not willing to find out
one word boring the young demi looks good but she s pregnant point for that d the movie is not scary at all the first scenes looked little crappy i could render better clouds with my laptop and after effects but that was then and now is now some movies do not get old well this is one of them not worth renting or buying get something better instead like the exorcist next doh the drama part in the beginning just and simply suxor d
chances are if i watched this again i might get physically sick the film is so annoying unless you believe in psychics re incarnation and the other hocus pocus which this promotes big time the re cycling of souls they call it here puh leeze this story has been done several times before with such films as heaven can wait it s also been done a lot better too bad they had to waste the talents of robert downey jr cybill shepherd ryan o neal and mary stuart masterson at least it s a pretty tame film language wise that s about the only redeeming quality of this movie
bestselling writer george plimpton alan alda takes on an assignment for sports illustrated he is to go incognito to the detroit lions training camp and try out for a position as third string quarterback he is quickly found out by the team members featuring alex karras and mike lucci the entire team finds it amusing to cause stumbling blocks in the writer s determination to quarterback for a series in a real game this movie is alda s debut and also helped karras leave the gridiron for acting besides the detroit lions the cast also includes sugar ray robinson roy schieder and lauren hutton alex march directs this story based on plimton s book
man has been to the farthest reaches of the earth and now he is traveling to new worlds but with new worlds come ancient evils the vampires of space and not just a handful but entire tribes in this film which i saw as bloodsuckers but i guess also goes as vampires wars we see what happens when the imperialist earthlings meet the imperialist vampires i will make this review very short because it s undeserving of a good review the best i can say for this film is it has a good cast of b list and upcoming stars natassia malthe was quintana and was far more attractive here than in bloodrayne michael ironside is muco and is always a fan favorite as i say he s the poor man s jack nicholson and we even get carrie ann fleming as damian s wife who horror fans will now recognize as the eponymous jenifer from dario argento s jenifer so this movie as bad as it is isn t without some names attached but the same can be said of uwe boll s work the concept of the military tracking and killing vampires in space isn t necessarily a bad idea but it easily falls into the realm of cheese and this film falls hard the acting especially from the vampires is over the top and i just didn t find the explanations of their existence very convincing worst of all the vampire tribes have the names voorhess and leatherfaces i understand this was supposed to be a clever reference for the horror fans but it wasn t clever at all it just sounded dumb and out of place unlike the much more subtle references in james gunn s slither such as naming stores after lesser known horror directors that s all i want to say if you can stand lots of cheese on this day i couldn t and i m from wisconsin and want to see average actors with poor costumes fight vampires in space although space looks a lot like any other forest on earth check this one out if you can find it i don t personally recommend this when you can watch other cheesy vampires films jon carpenter s vampires or other cheesy space movies or maybe even some good ones but hey do your thing

i ve never been to paris but after seeing paris je t aime i m crazy to visit this city i ve been to ny several times and i love the city and its boroughs i kinda expected to be touched by this film to feel like jumping into a plane and fly there right away but lo and behold i regret the time and money i spent with it there are no love stories between people or a person and the city there s a lot of dysfunctional meetings and relations or people who know each other and it just doesn t work out fine maybe this reflects a characteristic of the city where it s said to have thousands of people living on their own can t you find love in new york
i love john saxon in anything he s in the one time he takes over the camera though he directs a movie that should have more aptly been been titled please do not watch this movie called zombie death house the dollar shock insurance certificate is dear fred olen ray s tricky way of making you spend dollars on a filmed dump churned out by a major s cheese legend ray being the front man at retromedia ray by the way makes charles band look hotter than stucco ceilings on a ford falcon just plain bad now the both of them and boring besides it s great that ray is digging up this old stuff and in some cases it s public domain like the rest of the dollar video hucksters but in the case of zombie death house the word zombie sloppily superimposed to add ownership and interest on the part of f o r the only way to do service to this tripe is to release it on the dollar market for the curious collector and fans of saxon if you wanna see real saxon pick up black christmas nightmare on elm street or the glove
caught this on ifc yesterday and can t believe the positive reviews am i the only one who thought these ladies were anything but kate tells jed she could get fired because she s supposed to be a pillar of the community but puts out for him then they suddenly decide they re in love and she s so devastated over his death she doesn t go to his funeral much less tell his family the good news by the way how did an american get to be the headmistress of a very proper british school janine should have been kicked off the force for her inexcusable abuse of power but nothing happens and she winds up boffing a con she brought in for questioning and the less said about molly the better as for the guilt janine and molly feel over jed please it s the punk s own damn fault he got turned into roadkill where s the guilt over poor gerald who gets puked on if only i could do the same to the bozos behind this movie
this hal roach comedy short a tough winter is the ninety ninth in the our gang little rascals series and the eleventh talkie bascally a showcase for black comic stepin fetchit who gets special billing here we see him going to his shack where the gang hangs out farina retrieves a love letter from the mail for him and is told by stepin to read it since he can t read it during the day as he goes to night school it happens to be from his sweetheart in tennesse so now farina has to have his ears stuffed with cotton since it s too hot for him to hear in another room weezer relays instructions to mary ann of making taffy from the radio but because he keeps running back and forth to the kitchen he misses the lady announcer s segue to rice pudding and spanish tamale confusing mary ann with additions of tabasco and lux after the concoction is completed jackie and the rest of the gang help themselves with the awful tasting but very sticky substance as everyone gets stuck on the walls as a result as they all try to clean the mess stepin works in the basement on various pipes and electrical outlets that mixes variable appliances functions such a telephone that vacuums a vacuum that rings and a refrigerator that plays music the end what i ve just described portends the meandering nature of this our gang short that served as the pilot for a potential stepin fetchit movie short series it s just as well that it never took place as fetchit s characterization of the lazy negro was amusing only in small doses and would be considered highly offensive today many of the scenes i ve just described are good for some laughs though the final sequence was so confusing that the results were just too blah for me so in summary a tough winter is a curio worth seeing at least once by the way stepin s real name was lincoln theodore perry
i was bored around pm so i watched this movie and i could not stop laughing everything was so ridiculous the way the kids were acting like they were older than just cracked me up one of the kids had a ring that supposedly killed people after or so years it gave me the impression that he wanted to be a gangster it s pretty hard to take little kids seriously especially when it has to do with eating worms they act like everything is such a big deal like if billy the main character doesn t eat the worms then the world will end this is a good movie for little kids excluding the fact that a year old says penis but not for teens or adults who don t want to waste their time
i had some time to kill before watching football so i saw this movie being offered on the scifi channel and it literally after watching it i thought i had encountered my version of mentally walking the bataan death march as my conscious was beaten into submission by the awful movie which ripped off the mummy series and jurassic park it was so bad that i thought the opening credits were the highlight of the movie and then it went into such a abysmal descent that it made the recent drop in the stock market seem like a hiccup the acting was so bad that i was hoping that one and all would be buried at the end the lead by casper van dien made me long for the high caliber acting of steven seagal in on deadly ground as his line reading was so wooden that woody woodpecker was thinking of making a cameo to sit on his shoulder i also noticed that his emotional range is so limited that i was under the impression my kitten was more expressive when asking for popcorn to eat the direction was so abysmal i looked back yearning to my nephew s grade play recital which had more pace and better vision and the fact that this movie seems to be have spliced together from afterthoughts of the aforementioned movie franchise it can not even be thought of as a homage the fx of the movie was so bad that i thought the director and producers were enviormentally friendly by recycling cheap special effects from grade z horror flicks from yesteryear what robert wagner tom bosley and geoffrey lewis were doing in this movies is beyond me and they should look at litigation against their agents for misrepresentation for getting them involved with such a dreck of a movie my warning to one and all is watch this movie at your peril as this movie may cause your iq to diminish with prolonged viewing on a side note i noticed at imdb that sometimes salaries for movies are published i was wondering if their is a way that actors that should give the salaries back for their poor performances in such movies beware and be safe avoid at all costs
i honestly can t believe what passes for entertainment now death and making fun of death violence sexual innuendo adults threatening children crudeness alcohol abuse by minors drug theft dysfunctional parents babysitter from hell stereotypical jokes about african americans police and fat people and kids sneaking out of the house in the middle of the night yup sure sounds like a kids movie to me not add to that the dark and scary elements a dead woman possessing and turning into a house and keeping her loving husband a prisoner inside for over years and also terrorizing an entire neighborhood how sweet for kids parents is this really what you want your kids to be watching is this what you want to teach them about life this movie is too scary for young kids and i m afraid that teens today may be living some of this movie scenario so why rub it in their faces as for an adult audience you won t find it scary or amusing just boring contrived and predictable and the characters are just wrong clueless parents ignorant police stupid and annoying friends nasty and manipulative babysitters and beer drinking womanizing boyfriends what great material for kids does this really sound like a children s movie to anyone even the computer animation and good voice work aren t enough to redeem this terrible flick save your money save your time and save your children s minds go rent ice age monsters inc the incredibles shrek a bug s life any of them are way better than this horrid film spielberg and zemeckis shame on both of you for making such a disaster and then billing it as a children s family movie
after an initial release of very good eurotrash titles redemption has managed to scrape the bottom of the barrel with the bloodsucker leads the dance i found no bloodsuckers anywhere in this movie the story is simple a mysterious count invites several actresses to his castle for a little vacation after some sofcore sexual shenanigans the girls get decapitated one by one who is the killer who knows there are more red herrings in this one than at the local fish market on friday the pace is excruciating the story is silly and the skin scenes aren t all that terrific either give this one a miss
as a poker enthusiast i was looking forward to seeing this movie especially as it had scotty nyugen in it basically scotty nyugens short spots in this film are all it has going for it the characters are unlikeable and annoying the soundtrack is awful and the plot well there isn t one i honestly got a headache and found myself reading the barcode number on the dvd box after twenty minutes i was that bored its actually ashame that nyugen was in this movie as otherwise i wouldn t have wasted buying it off ebay take it from me avoid like offsuit dire
this movie was way over hyped a lot of the viewers who thought this was amazing must have been into the old school movies cause the whole movie is set in the past at first i thought the movie was just showing something from the past so i was expecting that faded dreamy like lighting on the characters to pass but it just going basically this was a movie trying to mix the future with the past and the don t mix very well in this movie even with special effects you could actually see the blue screen the actors were working with there are too many movies out there that do exactly what this movie did so there is no reason for critics to hype this movie up saying it s the greatest movie ever done it s just crap on a stick it also didn t help that the story line was sooo crappy i don t understand why hollywood agreed to have this movie produced and i also don t understand how actors actresses in this movie are willing to be in a movie like this it s almost as though everybody read the script and forgot to read the fine print it will all be done on a computer this was a movie that should have been on a movie network because nothing about this movie was revolutionary i m very upset with myself for paying money to see this whatever you do don t waste your time and money on this movie today or tomorrow
this movie is a pathetic attempt apparently to justify the actions of mary ann letourneau in order to do this they cast a year old well probably not in order to do this there was no way they could have cast a or year old as the boy because the love scenes would have grossed everyone out if they had even been allowed to do them as they should mary ann s boyfriend was my nephew s age making her a pedophile sixth grade people the definition of pedophile doesn t have to include many children all you need is one i really don t care about her upbringing or her unhappy marriage she had a responsibility to her students that she did not live up to the reason given is that she is bipolar rejected the diagnosis and refused to take her medication it s understandable then that she was not thinking rationally one hopes that she now understands her actions now that she and vili are married and have two children together i pray that she is on her medication and thinking clearly all that aside penelope ann miller was totally convincing and perfect casting for the role
a pointless movie with nothing but gratuitous violence the only fun i had was playing spot the location as much of it was filmed in my home town of regina saskatchewan i like to support locally produced films but this one was a major disappointment
my wife and i thought that with this cast and director the movie would have to be at least worth watching we were wrong in fact we gave up on it after minutes the idea that crawford young and tone are british but speak with american accents was for me impossible to get past hard to believe this is england when no one talks with a british accent there is zero chemistry between crawford and anyone and to echo a previous comment the idea that cooper and crawford suddenly declare their love for one another without any reason is ludicrous there is no reason to care about any of the characters which is why we threw in the towel halfway through i found it hard to believe that hawks directed this as none of the actors spoke with the trademark hawksian rat a tat delivery so save your time and skip this one
the words swedish and action movie do not mix that becomes more and more obvious with every attempt made in the genre this is yet another failed attempt lasse brunell shanti roney works at a military air base with top secret computer systems one day foreign criminals threaten to hurt his family if he doesn t do what they tell him they want the secret equipment and will do anything to get it this movie has it s ups and downs and usually in swedish action movies there are no ups just downs so i guess something in this movie showed some quality to begin with the positive remarks i can mention that the movie is technically well made the footage of planes and helicopters flying are well shot and look very nice the acting is of very varying quality shanti roney makes a decent performance while maria bonnevie is stiff and unnatural as usual i wonder how long swedish directors are going to keep using her even though she has the acting skills of a wooden plank stefan sauk is laughable as the cool special forces man who comes to the base to investigate and what about the action scenes well as i said above the scenes of planes and helicopters flying are nice but aside from that there is not much action to talk about and that is a common problem with swedish action films there is just not enough action going on maybe it s a budget problem maybe it s film making culture i don t know but it negatively affects the experience because quite frankly the story and acting is not good enough for this movie to rely just on that i rate this for effort
run away from this movie even by b movie standards this movie is dreadful it is also insidious in it s theme the main theme is that people who reject society and have no respect for anything are cool and worth admiring people who treat others with respect are losers guncrazy is a movie that speaks for the disenfranchised a lot better than this movie see it instead no normal kid would do what trent does state troopers do not work as they do in this film etc seeing this movie makes you realize why writers use the hooker with a heart of gold cliche mija is a completely unsympathetic hooker who yes has had a terrible life however she is such a terrible person the audience cannot identify with her usually there is one thing a movie can be recommended for in this case there is none it is such a ridiculous movie it insults the person who tries to identify with the main characters the acting is adequate by b movie standards and the direction presents nothing new or interesting
i can say without a shadow of a doubt that going overboard is the single worst film i have ever seen and yes i have seen cujo adam sandler is an abomination as schecky moskowitz a wannabe comedian working on a cruise liner that s the plot that s it nothing else in the film makes sense it s all over the place like a mad man s breakfast and not in a wacky naked gun kind of way but more of a frustrating throw both shoes at the t v kind of way even general noriega makes an appearance for no reason i can comprehend it certainly wasn t for humour add to the mix miss australia who has the worst australian accent i ve ever heared and you have something which i won t call the worst film ever made because going overboard doesn t even fit the basic definition of a film i highly recomend seeing this film as it will elevate the standing of every bad film you ever see i guarantee the first thing you ll say after seeing a bad film will be at least it wasn t as bad as going overboard
these kind of movies where a psycho of one variety or another tries to damage the reputation and eventually eliminate altogether some naive person in order to take over their life fatal attraction pacific heights the hand that rocks the cradle single white female and a thousand made for tv movies are some examples of this but while a few especially fatal attraction and pacific heights could offer at least some extremely paranoid suspenseful characters or a few plot twists unlawful entry plays everything by the book and were it not for the notoriety of its stars kurt russel ray liota and madeline stowe this movie would sink to mediocrity faster than a danielle steele miniseries russel plays michael carr an incessantly naive guy who calls on the help of a pair of officers when someone breaks into his house and tries to attack his wife madeline stowe unfortunately he quietly vents his anger about feeling so helpless in the situation to the wrong cop ray liotta a typically psychopathic villain with no limits for his power at first empathizing with carr probably only pretending to do so the cop befriends the couple but soon enough the cops wants carr out of the way so destroying the guys life nearly any way he can which is pretty easy when you re a cop and when you re the cop who has installed the guy s security system in his house in order to take over and presumably get his wife it seems less ends oriented and more like the cop just wants to prove his power the wife is more like a trophy in other words than an end and the story plays out entirely by the book you can probably predict every occurrence before it happens on the screen if you ve seen enough of these movies from the shocking moment our main naive character realizes he is a victim of credit card fraud perpetrated by the psychopathic villain to the turn around he s not really dead finale
when i d seen the name of this movie i d always thought it was a musical like the harvey girls it s not it s a pudding that overcooked hit the kitchen ceiling and was pried off and cobbled together no music and not a period piece but thoroughly improbable it starts with patriarch james woods telling the eldest of his three daughters a small child who grows to be barbara stanwyck that she must maintain the family name and home we thus think it is going to be a historical intergenerational tale and it is for a brief time then it turns into the story of cold hearted stanwyck s fight against lawyer george brent why is she so dead set against him well why else as we learn in a strange flashback sequence narrated by stanwyck she had once thought she could inherit some money for her sisters as well as herself of course by marrying she hit on someone she took to be a country bumpkin who was in fact budding lawyer brent lest anyone think the child they had a young man of eight or so at the time of the main plot is well you know they had a hasty marriage and during the very short time they were together he was conceived one of her sisters is in love with a painter named gig young who is played by gig young the other sister tries to take him away etc etc it is a shrill unengaging mess well enough acted but without a shred of logic or plausibility
i m not even gonna waste time on this one it s not funny not scary practically unwatchable and only occassionaly gory the fx suck though no pun intended this is a disclaimer watch at your peril ask yourself question are slugs scary
unfortunately this has been showing on star movies here in thailand for the last week or so it s complete rubbish acting as another member said this movie is a good example of how not to act i haven t seen a movie so poorly acted in a long time the actors can you call them actors are completely flat and deliver their lines with the passion of a dead dog i would say that in order to truly understand how bad the acting is you would have to see the movie but that would be akin to torture i cringe as the leading lady delivers her lines and the rest of the cast with their accents fake or contrived is equally heinous another actress with the fake british accent was pretty yes but good lord was her accent terrible mix that with her lack of acting and you have a disaster she should just have said nothing and i could have accepted her as the pretty girl oh my we just got to the scene where the leading lady s lover says really me after a forced crying scene from her laughable no really i just laughed out loud the sets and the art directors offer some saving grace to the film some of the sets are colorful and some of the scenes are rather nice minus the actors the old magic potion lady what another member mentioned the modern love song that was in the movie totally inappropriate for a period piece set some years ago i understand the movie was considered big budget in thailand at the time of it s production i would be seriously upset if i were the producer of this movie just goes to show that money does not necessarily make a good or even mediocre film i would give the king maker a out of but the costumes and sets make save the film from such a rating out of
i own this movie i bought it for at a fairly major video retailer in order to do some indie type movie research since i had just finished my own feature and was editing it now when i feel down about my skills as a first time director i just sit down with a plate of cookies and severed within minutes i feel great i hate to down talk another filmmaker so i ll just use constructive criticism find good actors take the time it really helps when shooting video over light your scenes and darken in the computer later on in post closeups are better for video when an actor enters a scene wait a bit beforehaving them speak so that we know what s going on and who s talking never show the back of a door while we wait for someone to come open it damn well worth the the true horror would be getting the reviews severed has here on imdb and you have to give these guys credit they did get distributed
now this film isn t going to scare anyone but it was interesting for two reasons two big reason and a smaller one well that s three reasons isn t it the first reason this is interesting is the special effects i found them to be quite interesting and somewhat spectacular to see the hair growing on marsha a hunt and sybil danning was creepy especially when they were participating in a m nage trois of interest is the fact that this marsha hunt is the famous brown sugar of the rolling stones song and that she was in the infamous nude scene in the london cast of the rock musical hair besides the special effects there were two other points of note in this film and they were brought out repeatedly during the closing credits i lost count but i swear that sybil danning bared those points for us in the closing credits at least a dozen times and maybe many more theyu were the most outstanding feature of the film
i rate this movie with skulls only coz the girls knew how to scream this could ve been a better movie if actors were better the twins were ok i believed they were evil but the eldest and youngest brother they sucked really bad it seemed like they were reading the scripts instead of acting them spoiler if they re vampire s why do they freeze the blood vampires can t drink frozen blood the sister in the movie says let s drink her while she is alive but then when they re moving to another house they take on a cooler they re frozen blood end of spoilerit was a huge waste of time and that made me mad coz i read all the reviews of how this movie was great how many awards this movie won and this movie was f ing s t
i absolutely hate this programme what kind of people sit and watch this garbage ok my dad and mum love it lol but i make sure i m well out of the room before it comes on its so depressing and dreary but the worst thing about it is the acting i cant stand all detective programmes such as this because the detectives are so wooden and heartless what happened to detective programmes with real mystery i mean who wants to know what happened to fictional characters we know nothing about that died over years ago i wish the bbc would put more comedy on bbc cos now with the vicar of dibley finished there is more room for crap like this
oh my god what the hell happened here i m not going to say this again but what sort of backward movie is this the dubbing in this is way worst than the dubbing in king kong vs godzilla linda miller had to be the worst actress in it and the suits are really cheesy its about some villain called dr who who gets henchmen to build a robot gorilla that has the same strength as king kong but when this robot breaks down he builds another one and then tries to kidnap kong when he does thats when linda miller gets annoying he makes kong his slave but everything goes wrong and king kong escapes then dr who sends the robot after him later when i was watching the movie i got a headache when linda miller and the other clowns started moaning as i sat through the misery of watching the dvd while it was playing i was hoping that the madness in the movie was going to end until the fight the ending has to be a really bad one because they could ve shown kong back on his island fighting dinosaurs again don t watch the movie under any circumstances or if you do beware of the disappointment you will receive
around the late s animator don bluth frustrated with the output his company disney was churning defected from the mouse house to form his own studio his first production the secret of nimh was a brilliant feature that still holds up well to this day this was followed by an american tail and the land before time both of which were made under the involvement of steven spielberg and were commercially successful although none of those two films had the dark adult appeal of nimh they still are very charming enjoyable features for both children and grown ups but before long don bluth had his first major misfire with all dogs go to heaven critics were especially harsh on this film and matters weren t helped by the fact that it opened alongside disney s the little mermaid considering that the movie has such a friendly sounding title one would expect all dogs go to heaven to be pleasant family fare instead bluth provides a surprisingly dark story involving gambling deceit crime mistreatment and murder that itself is not a problem for an animated feature per say but it does call into question over whether the film is for children on the other hand it s hard to say whether adults will find much to enjoy in all dogs go to heaven in short it s a movie with a major identity crisis set in a dreary junkyard of new orleans the movie starts out when charlie b barkin a rough and tumble german shepherd is run over by a car courtesy of his former gambling casino partner a nasty cigar puffing pitbull carface before you know it charlie finds himself in heaven albeit by default here a whippet angel annabelle tells him that all dogs go to heaven because unlike people dogs are usually loyal and kind this line represents the confused nature of the movie since the dogs in the movie the whippet aside are presented as anything but upon realizing that he s been murdered charlie steals his way back to earth and plots to get even with carface with the reluctant help of his dachshund pal itchy charlie rescues carface s prize annemarie a human girl who can talk to animals in order to predict who will win the rat races charlie claims that he will help the little cutie find her a family but in reality he is using her skills to win fortunes at the race so that he can build a more elaborate casino of his own to bring carface down although he refuses to admit it charlie does grow to love annemarie the concept of the story isn t as problematic as the execution aside from the human girl annemarie and a flamboyant musical alligator who appears about three quarters through with the vocal pipes of ken page none of the other characters emerge as likable nor frankly are even worth caring about unfortunately that also applies to charlie in trying to make him an anti hero the script composed by more than ten writers only succeeds in rendering the character too unlovable as such the audience feels no empathy for charlie and worse his redemption at the end of the movie does not come across as convincing further damaging to the character is the disappointingly uncharismatic vocal performance from burt reynolds besides the lack of an endearing lead the movie s other problem is in the structure of the story the slowly paced plot jumps all over the place and makes a habit of throwing in extra scenes which serve no purpose but to pad out the movie s running time the aforementioned musical alligator who resides in a danky sewer infested with native rats seems to have been thrown in from nowhere as does a scene where charlie tries to show his generosity to annemarie by feeding a pack of pastel colored pups pizza the whole screenplay feels like a rough first draft a bit more polish could have made this a tighter impactful story matters are not helped by the lackluster musical numbers by charlie strouse and t j kuenster annemarie s song and the gator s ballad are the only good ones the latter in particular benefits from ken page s mellifluous vocal or the uneven voice cast as mentioned burt reynolds stiff and lifeless charlie detracts from his already unlikeable character even further the only exception is a fiery confession to itchy about his true intentions toward the end dom deluise as itchy is pretty good but he s had better roles notably tiger in an american tail and jeremy in the secret of nimh ken page as mentioned is awesome in anything he does but his character has such a small part that his overall contribution is unremarkable at best similarly wasted are loni anderson as a collie who once sired a litter with charlie melba moore and charles nelson reilly judith barsi as annemarie is probably the only voice that comes across as truly memorable partially because her character is the sole legitimately likable one in this depressing and joyless show barsi aside the only real positive about all dogs go to heaven is the animation technically this film has some of the most imaginative visuals from bluth s team by s standards that is particularly a frightening scene where charlie has a nightmare about ending up in a fiery underworld ruled by a gargantuan satanic canine demon if anything the movie is more of a triumph of animation than storytelling on the whole however i cannot recommend all dogs go to heaven as good entertainment even though i recognize that the movie has its fans and the climax does admittingly provide some energy and a moving conclusion the overall package is not in the same league as bluth s better efforts animation buffs will marvel at the lush artistry but by the time it s over all dogs go to heaven could very well leave a bad taste in your mouth
this beautifully filmed and scripted episode was let down for two reasons perhaps it was the morality of the s talking but no man left alone on an asteroid for years would react with such hysterical negativity to the gift of a female android it wasn t an android at all but a woman the beautiful jean marsh the popularity of the sex doll industry in the coming decades could have traced its origins back to this episode if they d done it properly in fact the modernization of sex bots are in the news as i speak robots were not new to movies or television when this episode was made so they could have at least had her act like one her fleshiness would then have added a creepy element instead it becomes a nice little love story about two humans on faraway star the twilight zone always stretched the imagination and credulity normally no one cared but this episode seemed hamstrung by a calvinist morality eschewing what would have amounted to masturbation with a machine or downright carelessness
sly stallone is hardly the finest actor in the world but compared to his brother frank well roll out those awards now mullet haired muppet frank seems to think that every part he plays calls for him doing the role as an american italian wise guy refugee from the godfather please somebody make him an acting offer he can refuse this film just stinks the place out even by the terrible overacting in this frank still steals the acting dishonours all the people compensate for their lack of talent by shouting their lines and throwing their arms about gesticulating wildly in a style that went out of fashion back with silent films the plot what there is makes no sense as a meteor lands and turns all the women into sex crazed nymphets but as this is certificate film that just means they strip to their underwear and make moaning sounds like dogs on heat what happens in the end i m not quite sure as i was losing the will to live long before the film finished avoid this like the plague and watch deep impact for a reasonable film about a meteor about to hit the earth n b point of order when one of the female leads strips down to her underwear she has her knickers panties under her suspenders garter belt it s knickers over the suspenders to allow women to go to the toilet with less fuss a trivial point perhaps but shows how dumb this film is when they can t even get this right
a question for you a family go to a new house and get stalked by demonic forces which film am i talking about every horror film you ve seen yes that s true but that s not the answer i m looking for i ll narrow it down by saying there s a lot of teen angst scenes doesn t help well there s lots of bits where the characters are stalked by a creature and you see the characters through the creature s pov no futher forward okay there s a dream sequence involving lots of blood could still be any horror film you say oh gawd this could take weeks so i ll say the film i m talking about features loads of aussies many of whom have appeared in neighbours and home and away yes that s right the film is the third circle aka cubbyhouse and do you understand what the above exercise is about it s about me pointing out how the third circle is absolutely no different from any horror film that s been made
this is really a new low in entertainment even though there are a lot worse movies out in the gangster drug scene genre it is hard to have a convincing storyline this movies does not i mean sebastians motives for example couldn t be more far fetched and worn out clich then you would also need a setting of character relationships that is believable this movie does not sure tristan is drawn away from his family but why was that again what s the deal with his father again that he has to ask permission to go out at his age interesting picture though to ask about the lack and need of rebellious behavior of kids in upper class family but this movie does not go in this direction even though there would be the potential judging by the random backflashes wasn t he already down and out why does he do it again so there are some interesting questions brought up here for a solid socially critic drama but then again this movie is just not because of focusing on cool production techniques and special effects an not giving the characters a moment to reflect and most of all forcing the story along the path where they want it to be and not paying attention to let the story breath and naturally evolve it wants to be a drama to not glorify abuse of substances and violence would be political incorrect these days wouldn t it but on the other hand it is nothing more then a cheap action movie like there are so so many out there with an average set of actors and a vinnie jones who is managing to not totally ruin what s left of his reputation by doing what he always does so all in all i just can t recommend it for vinnie and for the editing
this movie is hilarious the problem is that it s not a comedy one classic scene involves kurt thomas just happening to find a pommel horse in the middle of a village square which he uses to pummel the bad guys another is the trek into the village of crazies too bad this movie wasn t made to be a farce or it may have gotten better ratings
in order to avoid confusion let me clarify a couple of points i am not a red neck i am not even a moderate nor a conservative quite on the contrary i am a radical a libertarian i m not a wasp either i was not even born in the states jorge luis borges used to say that there are some kind of folk who do not feel poetry and that these sad people usually earn their living teaching poetry this movie was made by and for people who do not feel poetry by and for show offs and i dare say by and for people who have no sense of decency or for that matter respect for other people s life or death especially when the victims are thought to be mostly bloody imperialists killed in yankee soil i even find the original marketing idea of the eleven episodes of eleven minutes nine seconds and one frame as particularly hideous and repulsive just plain awful why didn t they assign a budget of as many dollars per episode as individuals were brutally murdered in the attack the whole idea rests somewhere between mere stupidity and reckless fascism anybody who is serious about film making and serious about life and death should have angrily declined to participate in this recollection of innuendoes and non sequiturs with two exceptions the episode of burkina faso almost amusing and the one from india which documents the story of a man who was unfairly and wrongly investigated in relation to the attack on the basis that afterwards he didn t return home and that he was an american muslim and truth be told when the facts were known he was honored as a hero all other nine episodes essentially and extremely boring and emotionless can be listed in two different categories first i don t care about the thousands of victims americans foreigners children youngsters adults old timers and can be resumed in pure boredom and lack of emotion makhmalbaf s iran lelouch s france i m afraid i m going to commit an heresy since it s lelouch s but maybe his episode might be considered built upon an idea which could be regarded as almost original tanovic s bosnia herzegovina gonzalez inarritu s mexico gita s israel penn s usa second the bloody yankees deserve it and can be resumed in frustration and hatred chahine egypt vindicates the suicide bombers loach uk considers the reckless attacks were some kind of punishment for the alleged support of the usa to the chilean dictatorship headed by the serial killer augusto pinochet in fact someone should inform mr loach that the victims of pinochet were not related to al qaida and that chile is a south american country which sole existence mr bin laden should have ignored he ought to be informed too that the american government sanctions against the chilean dictatorship were harder than any other ciountrie s and imamura japan windingly points out that wwii is related the attack to the wtc imamura has at least been coherent in this the supposed cause effect linking is entirely nonsensical which plays well with his episode including a man who believes himself to be a snake it pretends to be obscure it is instead quite ludicrous there s some kind of error shared by many including some americans and it consists in the belief that this movie wasn t commercially screened in the states because of some kind of censorship nothing further from the truth this movie wasn t screened in the states because it is a complete fiasco a fiasco of the wackyest kind even in buenos aires where peronism and other forms of fascism are nearest and dearest to the hearts of a sizable number of its inhabitants and anti americanism is in vogue the movie was screened in living rooms hurriedly converted into theaters and was applauded by a very select public the usual sad few who routinely lend their applause to other equally quaint spectacles like the sight of a mcdonald s fast food restaurant or perchance an elderly jew being burnt to ashes
the main reasons to see red eye are rachel mcadams who delivers a stellar performance and jayma mays who is wonderful as the assistant hotel manager on the other hand cillian murphy overacts so badly that he becomes cartoonish the rest of the movie is riddled with plot holes on which i will elaborate please do not read further if you don t want to know what happens here is a synopsis of the plot rachel mcadams s character lisa manages a hotel where the new hard nosed homeland security director plans to stay that night rachel is returning to miami from a funeral but fielding calls from her assistant up until the plane leaves in the meantime someone is stationed outside the house of her father joe played by brian cox ready to kill him if cillian murphy jackson calls all lisa has to do is phone the hotel and move the director s suite to one where jackson s cohorts are planning to fire a guided missile from a fishing boat to kill the director and his family so here are some of the plot holes or absurd coincidences jackson finally convinces lisa to make the call and in the middle the phones in the plane lose their connection lisa tries to fake that she is making the call but coincidentally a guy across the aisle from jackson is also making a call and starts banging his phone to indicate it is dead jackson catches on and grabs the phone from lisa at one point jackson head butts lisa and she of course gets knocked out but only for minutes jackson catches lisa writing a note on the mirror in the extraordinarily large lavatory and he bangs her around a bit miraculously the only one who hears anything is an year old girl whose word of course is discounted lisa stabs jackson with a pen in the throat as the plane is landing steals his cell phone and makes a mad dash for the exit fitting down the aisle between the seats and rows of standing passengers despite knowing there is a passenger with a pen stuck in his throat the flight attendants oblige lisa by opening the door to the jet way ok all those are reasonable if not highly unlikely but here s where it gets really stupid lisa gets into the terminal at miami airport and there is no cell phone signal every major airport in america has great cell phone reception she runs through the airport with jackson in hot pursuit and no security officers even delay them jackson who lost lisa in the airport while the train from the gates pulled away to the terminal has lost some of his voice from the pen in his throat but he can still be somewhat understood however he doesn t bother to call his man outside of joe s house ps there is no train at miami airport but the one they showed looked an awful lot like the orlando airport lisa steals a car and rides away of course this time when she goes to make a call the cell phone says low battery and soon shuts off when will they stop using this inane plot device while the phone still said low battery lisa had reached her assistant just in time to save the director and his family from the guided missile launched by the fishing boat to the window of the room on the th floor to which the director had been moved of course they expect us not to notice that the hotel is surrounded on sides by ocean so the missile could have probably been launched at the first suite thereby negating the need for the whole lisa jackson plot what s the story here was the director s original room on the th floor one of the only rooms in the hotel with a lousy view nevertheless everyone gets out just before the missile hits lisa drives to joe s house to save her father only to see the killer outside although she runs him over as he is shooting at her by crashing her jeep into the house no one in the neighborhood seems to notice or bother to stop by jackson arrives at joe s house and knocks him out we don t see how maybe another head butt he then explains to lisa that he didn t kill dad yet because he wanted dad to see lisa die first give me a break what is this saturday morning cartoons for the rest of the movie about minutes jackson chases lisa around the house and she resourcefully fights him off of course a real killer i e one maybe played by jason statham would have done away with lisa or for that matter anyone who is not a trained killer in the first seconds during the course of this chase jackson steps over joe at least once without bothering to kill him finally jackson prevails and he is about to kill lisa when you guessed it he is shot by joe so here s my suggestion tell wes craven to stick to horror or maybe he should get together with michael bay who directed the equally stupid the island and make red island
i just blew four dollars renting this movie why alliance atlantis would promote such a poor excuse for a film is beyond me but even more surprising was the reasonably good reviews that a couple of canadian newspaper critics gave this film i m tired of our media justifying a film simply because it s canadian and low budget it s like they expect canadian films to be lousy so they give it a good review regardless now about the movie the acting was below average with the exception of the lead male character who was actually pretty good the film quality was poor which i guess could be expected from the extremely low budget the script was absolutely horrendous an example is the story which revolves around one of the lead characters a female drug dealer who flirts with one of her clients so that she can recruit him to fix and steal bicycles for her gang whose only purpose is to randomly destroy suv s supposedly many of her gang members bicycles are destroyed in these activities i don t know how she can t afford to just buy new ones since she is supposed to be this big drug dealing connection from vancouver to toronto anyway the point of the story which isn t revealed until well over halfway through the movie is that the drug dealer plans to firebomb buildings in the toronto area to attempt to make houses more affordable as no one will want to live in the area need i say more shame on the toronto film festival for accepting such a film telefilm for supporting it and the globe and mail and georgia straight newspapers for giving such biased reviews a film shouldn t get special treatment just because it s canadian
the problem is the role of the characters in the film man to man shows a british anthropologist kidnapping two pygmies and taking them to scotland and then realising that they are not animals or subhumans but actually equal to himself the problem is the role of the pygmies in the film two people who are kidnapped treated like animals and yet given such a shallow stereotypical role within the film the kidnapper british anthropologist ends up being the hero of the film because he manages to relate to the pygmies no notion of how the two hostages feel of their point of view of their ordeal i find it is a shallow film with a one sided fundamentally racist view it never manages to move away from the white mans view
i saw this movie with my rock climbing instructor and we found the entire thing so ridiculous as to be beyond pity for one if stallone is out free climbing by himself there s no need to carry any gear but i guess those dangling carabiners look sorta mountain climby so let s throw them in for those lobotomized folks who think that colorado looks anything like the dolomites in italy where the movie was filmed well the hollywood moguls have got a lot more ridiculous foul smelling stuff for you to swallow
a film like amazing grace and chuck is a perfect example of how the left in this country just doesn t get it they never did and liberalism continues to slip further and further into political oblivion this film deals with a little league baseball star who decides to stop playing ball as a protest to the existence of nuclear weapons the boy is understandably ridiculed until a bevy of professional athletes led by former nba star alex english join his cause not just a few of them join the cause by the time his movement reaches its zenith entire leagues of professional and college sports have to cancel their seasons since nobody will play any more just to move this review along i m prepared to grant them this premise even though it would never happen in a million years i ll just imagine it could then go from there i don t quite remember how but some type of agreement is reached and the boy decides to go back to the game he loves in an incredibly sappy and ridiculous scene before criticizing the message of this film let me just say that this film is poorly written acted and directed even if one does agree with the boy s stance it would be impossible to overcome how badly the film was constructed and that s a shame since there are plenty of good actors that go to waste peck curtis petersen alex english does as well as he could have with his character however and i wish he would try to act in more films alas it s likely much easier to find work in the coaching world of the nba one wishes mr english would teach more of these thuggish nba types of today how to shoot the rock a little better alex certainly knew how to put the ball through the hoop as far as the film s message in concerned it s just wrong headed plain and simple all of those nuclear warheads tucked away in those missile silos out west prevented war it would be one thing for this boy and his flock to protest an actual war or the use of nuclear weapons these weapons were in fact never used and that was the genius behind their existence neither side during the cold war was crazy enough to fire a single missile without these weapons who knows what might have happened between the usa and ussr the makers of this film obviously intended for kids in america to take up their cause and follow in chuck s footsteps kids in america however are more intelligent than the left wing kooks who created this dreck the film is worth only of stars if you want to see a great film about the dangers of nuclear war stick with dr strangelove instead mr newell you are no frank capra
i m basing this on my observations of one episode i saw last night i don t think i ll be watching again the acting was totally wooden the plot completely predictable the ending totally unrealistic i mean who would believe a million dollar judgment for the death of a recovering drug addict with terminal cancer the lead actor victor garber seemed so uncomfortable almost embarrassed in his role perhaps he realized how bad the writing was i fully realize that the drama offered this season is pretty poor but they can surely find better writers maybe they are outsourcing the writing to india or china i ll bet we won t be seeing this one next season
in a college dorm a guy is killed by somebody with a scythe his girlfriend beth dorie barton discovers him and tries to commit suicide she s institutionalized a year later she s out has a new boyfriend named hank joseph lawrence and is about to spend spring break with hank and four other mindless friends in a big beautiful condo in florida naturally the killer pops up for no reason and starts killing again lousy slasher thriller a textbook example of how not to do a low budget horror movie for starters large portions of this film are endless filler of these six idiots videotaping themselves having fun more fun than the audience getting drunk acting stupid etc etc also there is no nudity in here at all i m not saying a horror film needs nudity but anything to liven this up would have helped none of the deaths are really shown you hear them are only a little bloody and there is no gore there s one real gruesome one but that s not till the end with a few exceptions the acting sucks dorie barton is dreadful as the main woman and tom jay jones is lousy as oz chad allen pops up as brad and he s terrible lawrence is actually very good handsome and hunky and giving this crap his all and jeff conaway pops up in a small role doing a pretty good job logic lapses abound after they realize a friend has been killed two of the girls casually talk about sex baston s non reaction to seeing a friend getting killed is kind of funny and what happens to lawrence his character disappears without a trace at the end dull stupid no gore no nudity skip this one
i totally agree with the review by a reviewer of variety that the film is never quite as funny lively or insightful about the creative process as its premise would seem to warrant narratively it is messy and the lighting is really problematic if the film is supposed to be character driven the poor lighting doesn t enhance the acting and it is sometimes difficult to observe the facial expressions of the actors many non south africans will have difficulty in following the spoken english in the film and some of the local humor will be lost in the process i watched the film at the cape town world cinema festival last year comments and reactions to the film ranged from unwatchable and sloppy to a welcome departure from the films about our painful past unfortunately bunny chow won t be remembered as one of the bright lights of the south african new wave but some of the remarkable films about our apartheid history will indeed be rated among our best in our year old film history not surprisingly the film disappeared from cinemas in cape town only two weeks after its release and from most of the cinemas in durban and gauteng it has clearly limited appeal among south african audiences
i have no idea what idiots gave this movie a palm d or at the cannes film festival because it was atrocious i actually watched the entire thing simply because i couldn t believe that someone would make such a worthless film there is nothing interesting about the plot the characters are devoid of depth and there is no attempt at giving any sort of ambiance with music or sound effects also if you do decide to waste hours of your life by watching this film be sure to bring something to throw up in because the cinematography is simply someone running around with a hand held camcorder and half the time you can t even see the main subjects this style has been used much more successfully in movies such as blair witch because it creates suspense in rosetta there is no plot and no suspense to which that style would lend anything i should have known better when it came on at o clock in the morning that it was going to be horrible
everybody just seems to be raving about the subject and not really noticing how the movie was made the deaf mute guy is fine the underdog wins that s good the cricket aspect is great but the movie is average overall i think it could be made much much better than it is the plot is too predictable for a movie that is not based on a real life event i m sure the movie could have been made more interesting the songs are just stuffed in there and i had to literally forward the scenes where the same thing would be shown from different angles good acting though watchable
i can enjoy a guilty pleasure vigilante flick but this is just bad and not bad in a way you might enjoy seeing mst k make fun of it it s just nauseatingly bad like you can t find anything to enjoy about this no matter how hard you try i truly regret wasting hours of precious life on this crap you can tell by watching it that no one was asked to act and everyone in it knew this film would only bury their careers apparently walking tall has garnered enough income that someone decided they could make a buck off their investment if it s not the worst film i ve seen it s so bad that it s blotted the worse films from my memory
what a bad bad film i can t believe all the hype that has been lavished on this pretentious amateurish excuse for a real movie i left the theater before the end stunned by how bad the direction and camera work of that movie were and to read adoring paeans that claim there is truth and reality in this film when all it is in reality is a brazen attempt at pulling the wool over the eyes of reviewers and festivals by being cheap and tawdry at least this film showed me once and for all that the sundance festival has become a complete joke and that being shown here is more a label of bad film making than anything else avoid at all costs you ll want your time back i know i did
this wretched movie shows that not even some of gollywood s best can salvage a true landfill deposit i could spend much time describing everything that was bad about this effort but that would require more time and i ve already wasted minutes watching it looking at it now after brando s death shows how tragic the life of one of our greatest actors had become donald sutherland why i have to fill more lines to get this accepted i have to fill more lines to get this accepted i have to fill more lines to get this accepted don t waste your time with this movie i m overdue to do something interesting bye
i don t see how anyone who even likes van damne could like this movie the movie actually starts out with some promise i would say the action scenes at the beginning of the movie is excellent the actions scenes with the family ward trying to save the twins is a great start and is good lead in to the main story however the film is all down hill from there it would have been nice if the director could have stayed with the original premise that is the brothers are born in different parts of the world and thus learn different skills one brother is supposed to be skilled in martial arts but the other brother is supposed to be skilled in firearms how convenient when the time arises that the brother who has never picked up a gun before all of the sudden is a great marksman and the brother who has not been taught any martial arts is all of the sudden doing the splits and high kicks the plot action etc are just plain ridiculous my favorite scenes how about when van damne is confronting an armed soldier with an ak the soldier is about yards away instead of aiming and shooting at van damne he is doing a war cry like he is wielding a battle axe and running at him van damne proceeds to pick up a pistol from a fallen soldier and shoots him while he is still about to yards away this movie has one of the most disappointing endings bolo yeung is a skilled martial artist however instead of choreographing a decent fight bolo is throwing barrels at van damne like donkey kong absolutely aggravating movie that had so much promise if your a van damne fan save your time and see hard target or one of his earlier films
this esteemed production has it s fans but to paraphrase the classic bad review of mary reilly moby dick is like a painting only slower this is because the philosophical grounds for a movie production are never to make a great film rather it s to substitute the lack of a strong guiding idea in this case for a books transference to film with a list of hopelessly atomized undynamic but dazzling conceits in an effort to trick viewers into thinking they ve seen greatness as viewers critics are apt to fall for this oscars follow feeding the whole dumb equation i don t share in the pleasure all these reviewers found moby dick is stunningly uninvolving actors dutifully recite essays about jonah moby dick the ocean moby dick moby dick all things that can t respond and not one of which is absorbing in the slightest it s dramatically inert it doesn t build in narrative terms moby dick as a movie is little more than a foregone conclusion in search of an actual story after half an hour i was muttering oh terrific another oath another minute soliloquy in the failed effort to involve you it s a pretty campy overacting showcase a lot of grey hair here starbuck is supposed to be a golden god one knows one is looking at a great director when he makes the medium his own rather than trying to replicate the feel of someone else s paintings palette or reverently embalming a classic as huston does here paintings and books are nice but they re a different mediums a movie like this fails to grasp that an honestly enjoyable piece of crap village of the damned is better in most respects than an insufferable piece of culture this is the eat your vegetables school of film making one appreciates the work that must have been done to make the movie but not the narrative only a few segments reflecting maritime research are interesting the recording of shanties as a means of structuring work various sea efforts and the technology of whaling and that doesn t call for a two plus hour movie
practically the only other actor who would be less likely to play evel knieval than hamilton is anthony perkins yet somehow hamilton manages to turn in a reasonably effective portrayal and as producer of the film he wasn t likely to be fired or told he wasn t right for the part the early life of the daredevil motorcyclist is recounted here in multiple flashbacks the film opens with a rather silly prologue with hamilton in his white leather star spangled gear spouting the world according to knieval as if to say don t worry this film is about my youth but i ll be back in my familiar costume by the end of the picture hamilton is preparing for a huge jump yet is still licking his wounds from the previous one as devoted wife lyon both supports and derides him he recalls various vignettes of his childhood and delinquent teenage years along with his early days as a stunt rider and blossoming celebrity this flip flop approach is pretty abrupt and sometimes disjointed but it does prevent the movie from sticking to one of its inexpensive sets for too long a time or from getting into a rut with the fairly pedestrian characters hamilton usually a suave and debonair persona does a very fine job of enacting the tiny details of his subject s mannerisms and demeanor including his walk his hair is a shade lighter and longer and he works hard to give the right inflections in his speaking he even pays minor tribute to knieval s many injuries by appearing in a skimpy towel while his shoulders are covered in scars from the multitudinous accidents facially he looks nothing like the real cyclist but he does suggest him in his physical performance lyon is excellent at playing the young girl he loves and then the more worldly wife though her pack a day voice does threaten to give her away at any given moment she and hamilton strike up an easy chemistry which goes a long way in putting the film over other nice supporting turns are given by freed as his jaded doctor cameron as an early influence and taylor as a flea bitten sideshow barker the film was made on a low budget but the story is a rather low rent one anyway so that doesn t affect it too badly the makers wisely used actual butte montana locations to give the film a proper small town ambiance several of hamilton s antics are amusing though the character is certainly reckless and inconsiderate of other people s property some of the real knieval s completed and failed stunts are included in some blurry footage one of which features a mind boggling splatter in which the man is rolled up and snapped around like a rag doll hamilton s then wife stewart appears briefly as a nurse
the first mistake you make in titling a film is to use of the living dead without really having a budget for real zombie fx sure this was a low budget zombie flick really low budget i thought it was a film school project amateur actors and amateur effects it was really not too bad considering the above and it presented an interesting twist to the zombie genre if you are going to get an r for violence you might as well give us some good shots of the babes being attacked the women were so little used in this film that it could almost be classified as gay interest and i am staying out of oakland there was a heck of a lot of shooting going on and no cops in sight
let me first say i watched this movie around midnight and usually there only is trash around this hour but this movie broke the recordfirst of all the main character is an old non attractive creepy guy yet he gets to f ck all girls that come on his path for example he goes to a shop talks to a girl and then you see them f cksecondly there are loads of sex scenes and in many of them there is no nudity at all i would not have been surprised if one of the characters in the movie would say fast put your clothes on so we can f ck thirdly this movie should show what a sexual addiction can do to a man or a family this movie only shows soft bad acted erotica it makes me wonder why those actors agreed to play in such trash
well when the cameo appearance of jason miller looking even more eroded than he did in exorcist iv is the high point of a picture what ve you got it s a little bit country a little bit rock n roll mix two drunks with money who drag their kid all over the place with a bog dried mummy have you figured that one out yet dried in a bog in the basement christopher walken with a bad dye job and a little girl who might have been an interesting character if they d developed her i understand sort of that they re going back to visit her relatives after that problem there are several interesting flashbacks to what i must assume is her mother being killed in a car bombing i think this is never connected to anything problem what do we need the grandmother for now the grandmother could be interesting she speaks gaelic or celtic or something maybe you can make something of her the best they can do is that she s got a tobacco habit that s all problem they cast a real shifty character as the husband is he type cast will he sell his wife to the devil maybe he can look forward to the trust fund he manages for her or is he cast against type after all he has a good haircut and nice clothes he drinks he hesitates he s not a bad guy not a good one but dislikable why didn t they do something with him no problem an old boyfriend shows up the husband knocks him down he comes back to knock down the husband it gets pretty stupid but at least that character has motivation now she s an alcoholic he s an alcoholic he might only have married her for her money the grandmother is locked in the bedroom the blind uncle takes our heroine to the basement to show her the mummy of a witch are you following this who may come to life in fact you know she ll come to life the music swells a little girl lives in the house takes tea to the grandmother unlocks the door to do so and provides granny with cigarettes periodically granny gets out but nothing happens husband and wife lose the kid in the house subsequently lose their bedroom uncle gets his throat cut in the basement the leading lady has nose bleeds the husband drinks they both drink in the face of all of this the awful truth alluded to in the first over voice is omigod an abortion when the leading lady was twelve years old in spite of all these dangling thread ingredients nobody managed to get a story on the screen no bridge between situations no graduation from mild disturbance to awful horror just long slow scenes that go nowhere nbody really to care about and they had places to go with that aspect the innocent kid in the charge of drunks the grandmother who might be locked up because she s a monster but no her worst fault is smoking she s got great hair good makeup in short no plot just a little random predictable violence in a dark library with the rain gushing in and the sound track cuing us in you need more than a few drunks and christopher walken to make a movie the production values were good oh nice scenery good wardrobe the cameraman at least knew what he was doing i bought it poor me
it had to be you is another sign that hollywood is running out of ideas this picture is about charlie hudson a former police officer turned author when charlie s fianc goes out of town he s stuck with all of the wedding planning he spends a week at a fancy hotel and meets anna penn a teacher who just happens to also be getting married the two quickly become friends and set out to plan their separate weddings together this is when the plot gets boring charlie falls in love with anna and she has to choose between a safe life or charlie this movie rips off every romantic comedy ever made and just has you waiting for the end of the movie so you can do something else micahel vartan and natasha henstridge give really mediocre performances which just makes this movie all the more gut wrenching to watch
okay guys we know why we watch film like the invisible maniac just look at the cover man t and a all over the place with a lot more t than a but shouldn t there be a story to go with it c mon i can hear you say this is just girls gettin naked who needs a story well if this were called the naked maniacs i wouldn t have a problem but since these guys are cribbing from the invisible man they need to have a bit of story hereabouts you know to keep your mind busy however all they can muster up is how this crazy doctor creates an invisibility serum and when he cracks uses it to spy on naked women and ends up killing a lot of teenagers and when you see the smarmy looking teenagers he goes after you ll be grateful one star for the t and a but there s a little too much gore for you skin fans so proceed with caution tidbit yes it s that savannah
ostensibly this is a z grade dtv horror film but with lines like it s easy to die i have many times and why are you reading that book because it makes the plot more interesting and you made your way in here now you can make your way out again after he leads a man into the basement and take a listen to what they chant it s not that clear what this film made in the era known for post structuralism is actually about or whether its just bad film making the acting is atrocious but some actors i know so are they hamming it up an old house cut obviously with a contemporary dwelling is the site of murders a bad film is made in the grounds and the story replays again
stupid stupid stupid i can not stand ben stiller anymore how this man is allowed to still make movies is beyond me i can t understand how this happens if i performed at work the way he acts in a movie i d get fired and i own the company i would have to fire myself god this movie was just a plain steaming stinking pile of poo that needs to be vapoorized if that were possible something else i have to say the guideline about lines of text in a comment is idiotic what is wrong with just saying a few things about a movie i will never understand why sites will require a short novel written when sometimes a brief comment is all that is necessary
first of all jenna jameson is the best actress in this movie and she s just awful this movie has every horror move clich in imagination and all badly played the over sexed teen couple the comical not horny jock the snotty cool chick the creepy local color guy the parental type couple the virginal chick who amazingly never dies in these films the dialogue is so painfully awful and delivered with the depth of a wading pool it s almost like you re wishing that they d all die sooner i saw the rough cut of this film a while ago but somehow this just got worse sure the funniest thing in here is the ghoul trying to eat jameson s implants but that hardly rates even a rental of this dog avoid at all costs
in this extremely low budget i ve seen home movies made with better production value australian utter rip off of the burning friday the th a band is planning to make a music video while on a houseboat they re stalked by a serial killer who was burned years before this movie is even proclaimed to be the worst australian film ever made in it s dvd promotional material that s it s only selling point complete and utter rubbish in every considerable way perhaps a few chuckles here and there for bad movie lovers but it still made me want to burn out my retinas eye candy a quick flash of barely existent itty bitty titties in a lame shower scenemy grade f
the movie appeals to public due to charisma of ben stiller and notoriety of j aniston it seems that we have here a recipe for a successful title but there s nothing successful in this movie polly is very well played by aniston no doubt this is the kind of character which suits her perfectly bem stiller is the same troublesome guy like in meet the parents but in this movie the comic scenes are few compared to the title mentioned above the script is very poor with nothing special at all with this two well payed actors the things could get a lot better but what can they do when there is such a poor story and script out of
from the mind of harry alan towers comes another piece of cinematic sludge supposedly based on the work of h rider haggard the only similarity it bears to anything haggard actually wrote is that it takes place in africa albeit an africa that has dinosaurs which our intrepid adventurers use to pull their canoes and has some characters with the same names our heroes david mccallum patrick mcnee and john colico set out to seek treasure armed only with a medallion and end up precisely where the treasure is purely by chance on the way they meet a motley assortment of extremely lame monsters pick up a french chef and mccallum has an affair with the queen of phoenicia it s so ridiculous it s a hoot that s the only reason i didn t give it a
i liked batman dead end a dark edgy film noir setting for batman was perfect batman dead end is good this is not first of all let me start off with the acting none of it is really that good the best would probably be clark bartram as batman but that isn t saying much he is good at first glance and then you realize he is what he is a body builder who happens to be a tolerable actor but mainly the problem is that batman doesn t belong in the daylight he looks like a freak running around in a bat suit instead of a horribly scarred man trying to make up for past mistakes the daylight also reveals an irritating dorky scowl on bartram s face which never leaves and unoticeable in batman dead end probably because of the darkness of short which is so desired in this trailer bartram seems to think that scowling and stubbornly shaking his head is acting it s not it s quite the opposite it s called posing something real actors avoid like the plague something i never understood why collora casted body builders as the leads it makes much more sense to give the role to an actor who can manage it instead of a bodybuilder who can kinda manage it but hey he looks so much like the comic of course they might have done better if collora s dialouge didn t leave much to be desired the entire trailer yes trailer there will not be a full length film is more centered around superman then batman but everything on the superman side is corny cloying and amateur michael o hearn superman is one of the worst actors i ve ever seen he stands around smiles says his lines that s about it although i m not surprised since he is just a bodybuilder they hired and possibly received a few acting lessons once again i say to collora cast actors not bodybuilders actors will be so much more compelling that we will forgive the fact they don t look exactly like the comic book the costume is what you would expect superman to wear as for the batman suit well i guess it only looks good in the dark i say this because in some shots the suit looks like something you would buy from a halloween gift shop superman flies in this movie but that isn t a good thing these shots look especially amateur this and a lot of the entire film looks like it was shot in their backyard with a vhs camera the best shots are a shot of superman catching a car in his hands and the final shot of two face and batman at the very end for those of you who have seen the trailer you know what i m talking about now if only he could have stretched that shot through the entire trailer finally i ask why if you re trying to show your ability as a director would you make a trailer as a short film this proves nothing when it comes to being an actual director handling story my only piece of advice for collora here is there is a difference between the ability to tell a story and being able to work in marketing batman dead end didn t feel amateur i can t figure out where this went wrong
i really didn t like this film the plot was very predictable typical american plot i m sorry guy gets the girl kind of thing at the end and london has a monorail bank of london bank of england is what it really is i did however like the look of tracy island and the thunderbirds themselves and the brits were baddies apart from parker and lady penelope what was up with that oh and they kept on saying stuff like here come the thunderbirds but it was never known as the thunderbirds in the series why do that i d like to see this re made in years with more british cast i preferred the original series sorry
this is a pretty bad movie the plot is sentimental mush i suppose the production values are ok decent photography unobtrusive direction and all that mark hamill was terrible i ve never cared much for him and this movie validates that perception it s no wonder that he never really had any sort of career aside from his star wars films i ll just say buh bye mark as he sinks into well deserved obscurity on the other hand a very young annie potts utterly stole the show she showed charm beauty and acting chops all in one performance i remember seeing her in texasville recently and taking note of her beauty it s interesting seeing her from ten years earlier anyway unless you are interested in miss potts run away from this film screaming for the hills
star rating saturday night friday night friday morning sunday night monday morning james dial wesley snipes is hiding out on his ranch in montana after failing to capture a notorious terrorist then he s approached by the agency again to travel to london to have another go his target has been apprehended there and is under heavy police protection but they don t want him merely to capture their man they want him taken out all goes well but then the mission gets botched and when a senior police chief windsor charles dance is killed the blame falls at dial s feet hunted like an animal he takes refuge in a nearby house and befriends a young girl named emily eliza bennett who s dealing with issues of her own and becomes his unwitting sidekick as he goes about clearing his name and working out who betrayed him this latest snipes straight to dvd escapade came out of nowhere with a minimal of publicity even for something so small time i don t recall seeing any advertisements or trailers for it anywhere with this in mind and after snipes s history of duff dvd efforts this might have seemed like one which snoop dawg would tell you to drop like it s hot but i felt compelled to give it a go anyway it doesn t rank among his worst but it doesn t reach any higher than the standards of some of his better ones the detonator seconds says it all really either this is at best mildly suspenseful with a minimal of action naff all in the way of cool dialogue and snipes not exactly at his best in the lead role likewise in a main supporting role it s quite clear dance has only showed up for the pay cheque as well and this is generally one that none of the cast are going to shout for the hills about on any of their cvs it says a lot that by the end the only contract that s keeping you interested is when snipes s will end with sony and with it an end to any further sub par el dvd action films
i watched the film recently and it poorly resembles the book is based on i blame this on poor screenplay and direction some parts were forcibly introduced the gay rape scene for no apparent reason i actually read the book after watching the movie and some years or so after reading it for the first time i found it hard to read and somewhat clumsy too many disparate ideas introduced for no benefit at all other than sensational parts for the time as it covers stuff that was deemed sensitive to say the least during communism i can see the fascination it produced at the time that isn t the case anymore though or maybe i see things differently now or a bit of both the film tries too much to cover many aspects from the book the result being a concoction of scenes that may make some sense to someone who read the book even so this is a film that is difficult to watch and maybe should have never been made
when carol vanessa hidalgo starts looking into her brother s death she begins to suspect something more sinister than natural causes the closer she gets to the truth the more of a threat she becomes to her sister in law fiona helga line and the rest of the local satanists they ll do whatever is necessary to put a stop her nosy ways if you re into sleazy satanic themed movies black candles has a lot to offer the movie is filled with plenty of nudity and ritualistic soft core sex one scene in particular involving a young woman and a goat must be seen to be believed unfortunately all the sleaze in the world can t save black candles most of the movie is a total bore other than the one scene i ve already mentioned the numerous sex scenes aren t shocking and certainly aren t sexy the acting is spotty at best even genre favorite helga line gives a disappointing performance the plot really doesn t matter its main function seems to be to hold the string of dull sex scenes together i m only familiar with one other movie directed by jose ramon larraz compared with his daughters of darkness that masterfully mixes eroticism and horror black candles comes off as amateurish is about the best i can do
i love movies and i ll watch any movie all the way through just to give it a chance i can finally say that i found a movie i can t watch all the way through the acting is terribly stale and monotone the cgi looks like a computer geek did it in his mother s basement with minimal software and the long scenes of just walking and this movie is three hours long i didn t even make it minutes until i fast forwarded the dvd the scenes with the aliens are very short ummm instead of naming this war of the worlds lets name this war of the walking long distances this cost million dollars to make what they spend the money on the dramatic opening song oh but on a positive note one scene you need to watch is when the aliens first begin killing people that s hilarious not because people are dying but because when they turn to skeletons they still squirm for seconds afterward so like i said if you are a fan of boring stale action less movies here is one for you dvd collection but i didn t write this for you i wrote this for the billions upon billions of other people who will hate this movie it is not worth your time or moneyi know this is by the book but the book isn t that long and i m a complete book worm nerd geek whatever but why just get the steven spielberg version it s not all that good but it s times better than this i give this a big fat zero out of
despite the acclaim on the dvd cover of the version i borrowed this film was a disappointment yes it is far more realistic than other war films of the period for depicting the mud boredom and frustration of the grunt but unfortunately one comes away from it thinking that s all there is to this movie there is no plot and the dialogue is monotonous it s not that a good war film needs to have a battle scene every five minute one of the best world war ii films twelve o clock high has very little action but it compensates with crackling dialogue and psychological tension the exception to the story of g i joe is a brief battle segment titled city under siege on the dvd which takes place in italy admittedly it is one of the most fast paced and convincing combat scenes of any war movie but alas the rest of the film is not worth watching just for this highlight another turn off is pvt dondaro played by wally cassell who is meant to be a romeo but comes off a pervert by contrast sgt warnicki is a sympathetic if flawed man as he says to capt walker mitchum when volunteering for another patrol every step forward is a step closer to home but that last step one patrol too many drives him over the mental brink too bad the rest of the movie doesn t do justice to some otherwise fine touches as for meredith s portrayal of pyle it is practically comatose
woody allen when at his best has one of the sharpest pens around he can make an acute observation and wrap it around a punch line like nobody else however when he s at his worst his movies can stench of pretentiousness unfortunately melinda and melinda has this stench from opening to closing the set up is one of his more intriguing ideas in a while four friends sit in a restaurant discussing whether the essence of life is comedy or drama to help settle the argument one man relates the beginning of a story and asks the two other men arguing one a comic playwright the other a dramatic playwright whether the story is a comedy or a tragedy the two men then continue the story and the movie plays out the stories that they weave now when i first heard about this film my understanding was that they tell the exact same story the genre comedy or drama only changes by how you look at it now that would have been interesting however the stories only share one main element and a few side elements they are entirely different stories with major plot differences the drama is so stiffly scripted and pretentious that it can only really work as self parody if this was the point then it failed because these elements prevent the audience from feeling any emotional investment in any of the characters the comedy is the story that has moments of success but they are still short and fleeting will farrell is obviously meant to be the stand in for woody but he could have played this character so much more believably without adding woody s stutters and hand ticks woody is the best at being woody when someone else tries they re not playing a character they are modeling a recognizable actor this type of thing only pulls the audience out of the story my favorite woody allen movies make me leave the theater a little bit lighter in spirit than i walked in this one made me wish i could get my money back
boy this was one lousy movie while i haven t seen all of the burton taylor collaborations i can say with confidence that this is the worst this rich but ill woman taylor of course owns this beautiful island in the meditteranean ruling over a put upon staff when she s suddenly visited by this traveling poet who mouths platitudes in fact the whole film is just a talk fest with much of the talk making no sense even in no one could make heads or tails of this pretentious nonsense and the passage of time makes that even more clear if it weren t for the beautiful cinematography and scenery it would deserve a negative rating the only thing this film is good for is its unintentional laughs at the expense of the stars
there is a reason why jay leno himself will not acknowledge this film it consistently ranks as one of the worst films of all time the acting is horrible the script lacks direction and the director himself doesn t seem sure on which way to take this film a buddy film an action comedy mystery seems half way through he gives up and is just along for the ride jay leno and pat morita are talented and dedicated performers it is a shame that they wasted their time and gifts making this mess of a movie jay leno and pat morita prior to involving themselves with this had spent years pounding out their crafts on the hollywood circuit mr morita had already been a star in his own right acting steadily since the mid s as the star of such cult tv and movie classics as happy days and the dismal but affable mr t and tina and won the hearts of america with his roles in the powerful film midway the karate kid and a host of others mr leno can been seen on tv shows dating back to the mid s and was a top performer in the comedy clubs of america he can be seen in countless tv spots and in major films it is a shame that they agreed to be seen with this nonsense
i grew up watching inspector gadget it was and still is one of my favorite cartoons if not my absolute favorite i learned a lot of geography and history from the spin off inspector gadget s field trip i wanted to slip on a banana peel and become the greatest detective ever but the film has ruined the reputation of the wonderful cartoon matthew broderick an actor with potential was definitely not the role for inspector gadget first thing in the film inspector gadget is smart not so in the cartoon in the film gadget solves the mystery mostly by himself in the cartoon it was almost always penny brain and the awesome book i still want her book if gadget solved the mystery it was by accident gadget in the film seems to be a competent detective but in the cartoon was pretty dumb which was where the humor came from another thing is that it s too much good guy v bad guy in the film it s not just meant to be a silly saturday morning cartoon also gadget never should have a love story but disney corporation is filled with idiots also i miss the true gadgets that gadget had and especially the gadget car in the movie it was a chic convertible in the cartoon it was a sedan police car and could turn into a van it also barely had any gadgets and was mainly there to get him from place to place but if anything the one thing that was terrible about the movie was that it was a feature movie inspector gadget was a silly saturday morning cartoon the movie was too serious too overdone had too much of a plot and wasn t even remotely as funny tip for those who haven t seen it never see it ever watch the cartoon it s a true classic
about the worst movie in distribution right now i love zombie movies and saw this in the used rack so i thought why not oh my god a shame to zombie movies and fans to the genre whoever made this movie needs to put away your camcorder and go to film school there are so many gore hounds out there who have put time and effort into their films and they have something that this film doesn t dignity i know it what it takes to make films and i m sure there was a lot of money and time spent in making meat market but none of that money and time went in to making it good you need actors a script a real camera invest in some books on how to make independent films i don t know how you got a dvd release but whoever did that is either a really good friend or banging their head on the wall in gore films it is quality not quantity the effects are weak i was so angry that this is actually in stores and that i couldn t get my money back please if you have seen this film write here and put an end to shlock i know i m being very harsh i only had lines so i m trying to get to the point

there is a remark that one of heroines was raped on drunken rampage by russian soldiers which is completely untrue this movie should not be shown only because of this also there is a statement by someone that kgb prosecuted jews gypsies etc which is worse than nazis kgb was looking for so called zionist agents who were kgb believed imperialist agents this is totally different from targeting jewry as a whole nation as nazis did gypsies were never prosecuted kgb was political tool and used politically but from internationalist standpoint communists really did not distinguish between nationalities whole movie stinks like fake main hero does not speak russian signs in berlin contains typographical errors kgb general looks totally phony some so called russian proverbs are totally made up and list goes on and on not recommended to watch this movie is full of lies and phony stuff go to good shepherd instead
i tried watching this abomination of the cinema when i was five years old i have never been the same since filled to the brim with drug induced images that reek of the common ravings of your average asylum resident this movie despite its colorful appearance is not for humans especially not children it starts out innocently enough with a poor boy who ruins his classmate s drum by wait for it putting his head through it yes putting his head through it but fear not my friends he is quickly consoled by his chirping flute which is weird enough i ll grant you but still acceptable then the movie morphs into a combination of wizard of oz and where the wild things are but loses all the warm and fuzzy aspects of either of these two books so this seven foot yellow relative of barney befriends this poor boy and plunges him even deeper into despair and to add the pleasant array of horrific themes a carnivorous boat formerly a friend of the motley crew of hobbling grandfather clocks and doped up dragons is added to the mix of mayhem the most comforting image in the midst of this chaos is the villain aptly dubbed witchiepoo of course she has problems of her own what with an obvious plastic mask constricting her facial expressions to having to deal with a broomstick whose gas level always seemed to be at its lowest at the most inopportune moments as a result of this one of her favorite pastimes was nose diving into the body of water that separated the land of pufnstuf from her degenerate decaying abode i don t know where i would have preferred to live in summary this movie is terrifying if you want to watch the movie that has similar effects on its audience as the exorcist then this one is for you enjoy
this movie was probably about as silly as the naked gun which was supposed to be case in point in order to fake her drowning roberts is secretly taking swimming lessons at the ywca after her death the ywca calls her husband at work to give their condolences hello how did they get his work number before she leaves town she drops her wedding ring in the toilet days or even weeks later her hubby finds it in the john does this mean the toilet was never flushed no explanation is given on how she is paying for her mothers care in the retirement home since she did it behind her rich husbands back towards the end of this tiresome film roberts suspects her husband is in the house instead of running for her life she runs to the kitchen instead to see if the cans are stacked neatly
cult of the cobra is now available on dvd in a pristine print that does full justice to whatever merits it has as a movie unfortunately that is not saying much it has a competent cast of second rankers that acquit themselves as well as could be expected under the circumstances it is efficiently directed entirely on sound stages and standing sets on the studio backlot it looks ok but is ponderously over plotted and at a scant minutes it is still heavily padded for example the double cobra attack on the first of the gis was surely one attack too many the business about julia choosing to marry pete rather than tom never amounts to anything tom immediately falls in love with lisa and she never has any reason to be jealous of julia nor is she julia s feminine intuition is introduced as if it is going to lead to an important plot development but it doesn t similarly pete s investigation into cobra cults and the suspicion that briefly falls on tom serve no purpose other than to fill up screen time these are just symptoms of the underlying problem the movie is structured like a mystery but it isn t as soon as the curse is pronounced we know exactly where the story is heading so the characters are left painstakingly uncovering what we already know the ending is particularly lame julia is menaced purely by accident lisa has no reason to want to kill her she just happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong time when tom turns up in the nick of time to save her it is not even clear whether she was threatened at all he then simply disposes of the cobra in the way any of the previous victims might have done it is such an inconsequential little pipsqueak of a story that i found myself wondering how on earth it had been pitched to the studio heads then it occurred to me someone said those val lewton movies were very successful over at rko so why don t we make one like that cult of the cobra is clearly modelled on cat people mysterious troubled shape shifting woman falls in love with the hero is apparently frigid kills people arouses the suspicions of the hero s woman friend and dies at the end but modelled on doesn t mean as good as by a wide margin it copies but doesn t understand what it is copying it is obviously trying for the low key suggestive lewton style but this approach doesn t follow through into the story lisa is no irene she is meant to be strange and mysterious but there is no mystery about her we get a glimpse of her after the first attack in asia so immediately recognise her when she turns up in new york there is never any doubt about her purpose neither is there any ambiguity about whether of not she actually turns into a snake then again during her nocturnal prowling we get not one but two attempts at buses neither come off because the director doesn t understand what makes a bus work and in any case they happen to the stalker not the person being stalked these faint echoes of cat people give cult of the cobra whatever small distinction it might have but they only draw attention to the yawning gulf between the original and the imitation plagiarism may be the sincerest form of flattery but i doubt if lewton or tourneur were particularly flattered when this tepid little time passer came out
i think if you are into the sixties kind of thing as i am you are obligated to waste about minutes of your life watching this barely watchable trainwreck the saving graces of this oddity include a surprisingly apt social commentary on sixties values along with a number of relatively well known actors caught in early and embarrassing footage it s as if the producers of laugh in sat down and decided to write a full length film covering all the high points and more of the issues between the flower children and the establishment then put it in the hands of a couple of hippies and gave them about a budget to complete it hardly a classic but in its own way it does capture how truly strange that time was the silliness the over idealism and the uptightness of the establishment clearly not for everyone
the first home alone was a decent enough film the sequel was pretty much the same at a new setting this one tries to be original and succeeds to some degree of course the formula is basically the same so it s like watching the same movie for a third time with slightly altered plot the new score is quite bad though the new setting traps piece was if nothing else interesting and different especially compared to the grand score of the first and the almost but not quite as good score of the second it almost makes up for it by using some pretty good non original music but it s just not the same the plot is fair and somewhat original to the franchise but it s still basically the same movie as the first two with worse acting and a less impressive example of the scary character turning out to be good the acting is mostly unimpressive the characters are mostly caricatures the new thieves are less entertaining than the old ones and they make fun of spy stuff which is almost criminal given the limited amount of good spy flicks there are and how precious few of them are cool the fact that there are more of them and thereby more traps is just a weak attempt at trying to go one higher than the first two films and it doesn t work the idea behind the thieves and their mission is a tad too adult and serious for a children s film and there was a sexual joke or two though that isn t the first time in the series it s also unnecessarily complex as is the plot in general i could follow it but i doubt a kid could some of the exposition are delivered so obviously that even children may find it stupid the animal stuff is generally not amusing there are fewer siblings which should mean that those there are get developed more but they have less personality than the least featured of those of the first two films all in all just not particularly good or worth watching unless you really love watching criminals getting hurt in cartoon y violence i recommend this to huge fans of the series only
woody allen has lost his ability to write dialogue or characters that are clearly distinguishable from each other this is the case with melinda and melinda where all the characters speak with allen s generic pseudo sophistication and have problems and points of view that are not relatable to anyone outside of a four block radius of where allen lives they also share the same curious condition of being able to afford multi million dollar manhattan apartments that appear to have been designed by professional decorators regardless of their financial situation or what they do for a living the only character who exists outside of this dull mindset is will ferrel as the obligatory woody allen surrogate although he does not simply come off as merely doing a woody allen impression like kenneth branagh in the god awful celebrity ferrel lacks the charm or charisma that the real woody had when he was playing the part himself in his best movies the end result is another in a string of self indulgent bores from a once great filmmaker who has been trading in on his former reputation for years
with a story and screenplay that seems to have been written by a high schooler the art of seduction fails to deliver the romantic sophisticated experience it tries to bill itself as the two main characters have the potential to be interesting both male and female lead are swinging singles or in the female lead s case engaged but the art of seduction doesn t even try shirking from a frank examination of these two characters personalities the art of seduction eschews anything of substance for a basis of thin lean stereotype the art of seduction is insulting insulting to its characters insulting to men and women and insulting to its audiences expectations it takes the awful beautiful people we all know and plays out their painful interactions while expecting us to idolize them ji wan is an immature spoiled manipulative bitch the viewer is expected to like and forgive her flaws because she s pretty min jun well he s exactly the same neither are nice people the humour in this film primarily revolve around ji wan and min jun s outlandish attempts at outdoing each other in the honourable art of lying and manipulation no character development occurs and we never learn why ji wan and min jun are like this we are simply expected to take them as they are and not ask questions they re cute and that s all that matters the copious references to the celebrity of the main actors in azn cinema scenester s reviews may tip you off to art of seduction s shallowness if you re still in high school you liked grease or you are a yellow fever victim you may like this movie despite its romance tag this is not a very good date movie
kitten natividad of russ meyer film fame plays chastity knott a woman who has found she has breast cancer so she goes to south america to get some special fruit crockazilla that is supposed to have healing powers after going down on some of this fruit which appears to be plastic bananas on stalks chastity is endowed with some mystical magical powers that makes her a super hero specifically the double d avenger note that she s also wearing a pair of panties as a mask in writing that all sounds pretty good in execution well it leaves more than a little to be desired it seems that chastity owns a pub and a local strip joint is upset because she s taking away their business so some of the strippers including haji also of russ meyer film fame go after her to ruin her of course chastity fights back in the guise of the double d avenger watch her do a wonder woman type spin to change into her outfit and also lose her balance due to excessive centrifugal force bad jokes and lame double entendres fly like there was no tomorrow with the inane theme song playing over and over this comes off like a twisted s live action kid s show with adult content although while this is unrated it could probably get away with pg at the worst and it s probably a blessing that the faded stars kept well covered this makes doris wishman s chesty morgan films look positively wonderful in comparison special appearance by forest j ackerman but so what very stupid and i m never buying another film with joe bob briggs on the cover out of
i loved the curse of frankenstein so much that i rushed out to get frankenstein must be destroyed to see cushing at it again even if it was without chistopher lee this time to my great disappointment this movie not only does without lee but it does without frankenstein s monster altogether was it a case of if we can t get lee we won t have a monster at all why would they do that the monster is half the fun of the whole thing this film is dedicated solely to the study of baron frankenstein and his quest to finish experiments he had begun in brain transplants before ending up in an asylum i found the script extremely weak with the need to suspend disbelief forced upon the audience a little too much i m willing to suspend a fair amount but this movie got fairly ridiculous which took me out of the film rather than immersing me in it peter cushing though is absolutely brilliant playing pure evil in this film for being one of the most beloved actors and notoriously sweet men he sure could play menacing and malevolent extremely well the supporting cast is competent but has little to do even the young doctor and his fianc e blackmailed into helping frankenstein a bumbling police chief is introduced along with his put upon sidekick to generate some comic relief then they are completely dropped from the movie why we are led to believe that the police chief will be the main nemesis of the baron then we are led to believe it will be the young doctor and then it ends up being the victim of frankenstein s brain transplant experiment there was no tension we weren t invested in the creature and the ending was left so ambiguous as to leave one unsatisfied because it is so clear they are setting up another sequel also there are virtually no horror elements yes there is a beheading in the beginning off camera and we are treated to the sounds of cushing cutting the tops of two men s skulls off again off camera and there is the most unsettling and thoroughly unnecessary rape scene of which is again off camera i understand that there is a love of letting the audience imagine it all for their imaginations are far worse than what we can show but come on if you re not going to give us a monster then at least let us see the few horrific elements you do choose to include showing us a skeleton in the lab lit with a green light is just not scary on top of a weak script i thought the directing was mostly flat there were a couple of nice shots but otherwise no excitement atmosphere or suspense was generated the same director did curse back in and i thought it was brilliantly directed guess he was as uninspired by this film as i was the movie gets a out of from me strictly for peter cushing s powerful nuanced performance beyond that i found little in this movie worth recommending instead my suggestion is to watch the curse of frankenstein and see a truly great hammer horror film
i discovered this movie on ifc and i thought it would be interesting for tiny love stories some of the stories really dragged on in this movie the fact that none of these women had names almost makes you suspect that the actresses were talking about their own real sex lives including kathy baker and alicia witt i have to admit i want to start seeing some more romantic views of first sexual encounters again like in strike when odette sinclair s acquaintances started asking about her presumed first time and tweety asked was it beautiful some might think re enactments and flashbacks would improve this movie i think it would make things even worse it doesn t necessarily have to be hardcore porn to get my attention but somehow i just expected more
but it ll make you wonder if we had any in the first place this movie is just as bad as any of today s horrible horror a man goes around ogling semi clad ladies trying to decide which one to kill so he can give his girlfriend a new body one scene involves a man staggering around and spurting all over the set for a full three minutes coating everything what what must be well over ten gallons of blood the movie also attempts to create a sense that what the man is doing to his girlfriend is wrong and against nature but the movie is so badly done it s impossible for the audience to dredge up any feeling of shock or outrage aimlessly dark and unimpressively sinister this movie can t even get its own title straight the beginning credits say the brain that wouldn t die but the end credits list it as the head that wouldn t die
this is only somewhat attractive for fans of bad movie entertainment it is more worthwhile for students of s pop culture the fashions the furniture the attitudes and that great women s lib moment of the early s when it was still fresh and novel for a self employed independent woman to exist superchick joyce jillson had a monetarily rewarding if stultifying career after all what is a flight attendant but a waitress at feet that goes for the male ones too she slept around with multiple men could protect herself and others with karate and wasn t tied down to anything this is the kind of emancipated woman that scared the juices out of anti feminists those retrograde idiots who believe that no woman is complete without a husband the sexy stewardess was a potent archetype of the late s to s geez even on the partridge family i remember swinging bachelor ruben kincaid constantly hooking up with stewardesses and from that point of view this silly film is an important pop culture time capsule of the pre aids free love women s lib swinging seventies the plot is quite awful though and for those cavemen in the audience there are few bare breasts to look at
unhinged follows the typical plot of the early s slasher trend pretty young girls in peril i have to give it up for the filmmaker who used a helicopter for some of the early road trip shots you actually think for a second there s going to be quality in the production watching unhinged was like seeing an amateur acting class go through it s warm up some of the most awkward badly lit overlong scenes are played out with the gusto of a valium overdose i wondered why they didn t just put the cue cards on camera so the actresses wouldn t have to constantly shift their gaze the two main girls were obviously chosen for their t a factor rather than talent laurel munson as the main chick terry is as exciting as watching paint dry two nude scenes make for an adolescent thrill janet penner and virginia settle as the crazy creepy daughter and mother the chicks find themselves stranded with compete for worst acting ever long pauses weird expressions emphasis on the wrong word it s all there and is a delight for those of us out there who love bad films the scenes shift suddenly with long black outs you could drive a mack truck through cartoon lightning crashes across shots without even bothering to show the sky eighties eyeshadow assaults the viewer but ya know it grew on me i felt sorry for it i wanted to hug it kiss it s boo boos and make it better the ending doesn t make up for the damage it s caused but i grinned anyway i have my own theories regarding the whole banned hype and hope that anyone who chooses to view this film does so with substantial substance abuse and a sense of humor otherwise pass
this is possibly the worst of all the columbo movies andrew stevens acting is poor as the villain and the plot is weak in fact none of the cast seem able to act other than peter falk who puts in a creditable performance as the lieutenant
oh brother the only reason this very irritating film avoids getting the total bomb from me is because it s at least historically noteworthy as the first three stooges film when they weren t yet on their own and were still saddled with that painfully unfunny ted healy but even as a longtime stooges fan i d have to say that young moe larry and curly are badly used here as three zany assistant janitors to mr healy s taller boss janitor they re not featured steadily through the movie and their silly on and off again stints paint them more like zany overactive cartoon characters trying too hard to be amusing most of this toothache deals with jack pearl seeking in vain to get some chuckles from the audience himself as a man who impersonates baron munchausen here s a good example of the level of humor i object on what grounds coffee grounds his sidekick is none other than a young jimmy durante but even the schnoz himself is a bore
i watched this film based on the very favorable reviews that i read about it here by others they definitely saw something in this movie i didn t see that s for sure the movie starts off at a good pace and the first or minutes of it are interesting then it begins to get logged down and draggy not to mention completely unbelievable eventually you find yourself saying what he s going to do that too just how far is he going to go with this thing the plot begins with jeff goldblum s character john going into a deli to purchase a bottle of wine there is a robbery and a new store clerk auggie rose gets killed during the robbery john gets in the ambulance and goes to the hospital with the guy this seems a little much but wait there s more john becomes totally obsessed with auggie rose for reasons that never make any kind of logical sense john who has a very good life a beautiful loving girlfriend a secure well paying job nice house nice car expensive suits decides he wants to be a loser like auggie rose was and experience life in a low paying job living in a dump with a dippy girlfriend and possible connections with dangerous people why this dim witted half baked film got favorable reviews i ll never know sure goldblum does a good acting job he always does and his looks have improved with age but unless you have a big infatuation with jeff goldblum and have to see every film he s in i wouldn t recommend this turkey it s approximately two hours of your life you re not going to get back and believe me you ll have nothing to be thankful about when those two hours are over other than being grateful you re not still sitting there watching this film
blue monkey or invasion of the bodysuckers as it s known here in the uk was a pretty boring horror movie about an old man who gets bitten in a greenhouse by some mysterious toxic plant the man gets rushed to hospital where this worm like creature comes out of his mouth of course this transforms into this insect monster and proceeds to go on the rampage despite steve railsback and john vernon being in the movie i found it to be boring with a flat predictable storyline un interesting characters cheap special effects and lack of action horror fans don t really need to track this rare movie down you wont be missing much trust me i give this movie
there is no artistic value in this movie to deserve any award well it does not deserve an audience as well ironically one of the awards is for cinematography but frankly the camera movements are disconcerting to say the least every frame you feel you are getting the full picture its like someone is cropping your view from the edges the story is pathetic well i will be honest i could not bear to watch the entire movie the part that sucked the most was when i saw the soldiers partying in their barracks and one of the soldiers coaxed to drink liquor these and many other similar scenes reminded me so much of steven seagal take my advice stay away from this piece of crap
creepy lascivious wolf the young red is wearing full make up and extremely short shorts robe got about minutes through and realized it could be a pedophile s dream come true the up beat music sounds a lot like something i d hear at a strip club i actually think this movie is a sick joke it s not a family movie gross glad i was watching this with my daughter i don t want her to think it s normal for families to view quasi kiddie porn together very bad very sad it s sold as a family film joey fatone will probably be embarrassed he was in it and what s with advertising it as a special effects spectacular the effects do look low budget gawd awful
the only value in this movie is basically to laugh at how bad it really is with a plot that makes your average middle school writer look good and acting which is almost as good it gets my bottom score one of tom hanks very early films where he obviously didn t have the pleasure to be real picky the best special effect of the movie consists of a guy dressed up in an incredibly fake rubber monster consume
i can t stand most reality shows and this one is worst than the one with paris hilton and sure it s his company but you re fired or you re hired for how many seasons now after watching the show i wouldn t want to work for the guy with his ego and all and i think watching paint dry has more entertainment valve i d love to hear just one person get up and say donald i quit and take some of your money and buy a decent hairdo i see he s even trying to buy fame in the wrestling wwe i hope he gets hurt so i don t have to see his pathetic face anymore it must be sad to want fame so bad and have no talent and make an ass of yourself trying to buy it i d give this show a negative mark if i could but it gets a and it doesn t deserve that
but i doubt many were running to see this movie or some came running out of the cinema okay that s a bit harsh the film starts in an unintentionally comical way frankie boy comes back to his hometown after many years this already smells of clich s and the whole town is shaken by his arrival he is talked about everyone wants to talk to him and every woman he meets flirts with him like there s no tomorrow even his niece hints that she would gladly have dropped her date to chat with frankie boy a little longer even his pretty niece wants a piece of him sounds like one of those laughable mike hammer episodes where every single female wants stacey keach and like stacey keach frankie boy is anything but a good looking woman s wet dream in real life someone like sinatra without the fame wouldn t get within m of someone as beautiful as maclaine but in this hollywood movie it s the other way around maclaine is absolutely nuts about frankie boy but he couldn t care less sinatra plays his cool shtick much too often in his movies and it is rarely credible dean martin is kind of miscast he isn t miscast as a card player but rather because of the accent which simply doesn t suit him maclaine is charming as ever but she plays a caricature and this reliance on caricatures is one of the basic problems with the film the main characters are all some sort of stereotypes out of bad or seen it all before movies and cheap novels frankie is the cool cat who comes back to town to get all the women and he couldn t care less about his writing which predictably eventually garners recognition martin is a sleazy but friendly card player maclaine is the dumb but very likable bimbo frankie s blond love interest is a snotty literary expert frankie s brother is the successful guy who married into his wife s business and has a lousy marriage and so on clich s the story contains a couple of coincidences which are a little too far fetched for my taste frankie just happens to bump into his niece in a locale his niece just happens to be meters away from her daddy when the latter kisses his secretary for the first time and then there is the awful stupid ending in it a drunk guy bent on killing frankie boy somehow manages to find him in a carnival of all places the place is utterly crowded with the typical noise and chaos plus it s happening in the evening and yet the guy somehow finds frankie in spite of being drunk as a doorknob and shoots at him but guess who he kills maclaine she jumps in front of the bullet to save frankie a clich which comic book writers might cringe at this utterly pathetic over dramatic and annoying ending certainly cannot please any even semi intelligent viewer and this happens on the same day that maclaine and sinatra got married the writer of this nonsense seems to have read crappy dime novels his whole life how else is the writing of this movie to be explained there is even a card game in which a brawl ensues with frankie martin vs some clich caricatures out of the writer s vivid imagination it was like a damn western suddenly another dumb thing is the way sinatra was crazy about the boring snotty nosed bimbo and pretty much ignored maclaine as the movie progresses we find out that sinatra finds maclaine to be too dumb for him just as the blond bimbo finds sinatra to be too low class for her there is a certain snobbism and disdain to be detected in the script regarding maclaine maclaine is treated as worthless by everyone while the blond bimbo is treated as a princess and an intellectual the ironic truth is that the latter s character comes off as rather dumb and not at all as intellectual her behaviour comments and opinions are mostly clich d silly confused pretentious and primitive at least maclaine s character knows that she maclaine is dumb there is another irony that i didn t fail to notice sinatra had trouble finding an ending for his latest story much like the writer of this movie and that s why he came up with the corny crappy finale the film basically has a solid cast and the photography is nice but the script though sometimes okay relies to heavily on silly nonsense instead of on reality based characters and events if you re interested in reading my biographies of shirley maclaine and other hollywood intellectuals contact me by e mail
awful just awful my old room mate used to watch this junk and it drove me crazy the book is one of my favorites and its a shame that some people will never know what it is really like because their first impressions are from dribble like this they changed so much it is hardly recognisable which baffles me since the book reads like a soap opera anyway providing enough fodder for modern day entertainment it s like one of those lifetime movies that say based on a true story but are completely fictional there is none of the emotion or depth of the book just mindless melodrama if you are a high school student looking for a way to get out of reading i suggest you try another version
i don t see much reason to get into this movie in much detail sylvester stallone is once again john rambo author and survivor of a season in hell recruited from prison by his only friend major richard crenna to secretly return to vietnam take photos of the american prisoners believed to be still held in horrible camps and return without engaging the enemy fat chance what if he actually did nothing more than sneak in take pics and sneak out who would come to see the movie it s essentially a celebration of stallone s muscles preparing for his mission we see his well oiled muscles bulging they are oiled and bulging throughout there is the ritual strapping on of black leather ugly guns and even uglier knives the black guns are cleaned assembled with loud clacks and almost as oiled as stallone s muscles the bow is tested and yes it has enough poundage to drive a bolt through an enemy s forehead the knife is sharpened with slick snicks stallone and one of his pows are betrayed by one or two of the suits from washington cynical politicians who you can bet were never even in a fist fight in grammar school no guts you know just sit around with their feet on the desk and drink foreign beer the movie does what it set out to do but what it set out to do is meretricious it deliberately cashes in on the myth popular in the mid s that there were uncountable numbers of mias quietly kept in wretched camps by the north vietnamese the bumper stickers were ubiquitous free our mias why would they keep them it was never quite reasoned out but perhaps to turn the pows into a slave labor force in a country that has absolutely no resource other than labor or maybe for their propaganda value as an instrument to humiliate the united states a propaganda weapon that the vietnamese kept secret from the world as a captive rambo is treated in a medieval fashion by the north vietnamese dipped to his neck in pig excrement and then hauled out of it by his wrists his muscles still on display then not content with subhuman vietnamese a russian officer is brought in to play the part of the gestapo officer vee haff vays of making you remember a high tech type the russian uses psychology and electricity not just pig dump rambo returns and declares that he intends to drift aimlessly until this country loves us as much as we love it bringing up another myth that vets returning from vietnam were uniformly spat upon and cursed which is why i guess we elected so many to the congress and appointed others to high echelon positions the last three losing presidential candidates were among that despised group at least rambo s aimless drifting left room open for a sequel which arrived apace the action movies with schwarzenegger and willis and others were leavened by wisecracks but rambo is humorless it marches dully through it s phantasmal ideological swamp killing without mercy barely speaking barely able to speak to speak is a sign of weakness
what a load of rubbish i can t even begin to describe how awful this film was the rating it has here is really hard to believe avoid particularly if you enjoyed the first ginger snaps the first one was well written well directed well executed a brilliant film with a fantastic aesthetic and atmosphere the second one was alrite decent as a self standing film but clearly not up to the level of the first the third is an insult to the series period i rate the films it s that bad oh and yes it really is set in the past the sisters are still called ginger and b fitzgerald all muddled in with some half assed native american mythology the sisters don t have any real story or progression or even a clear relationship they re just trying to survive and be together forever that s about as deep as it gets staggered that the girls agreed to be in this pile of shite after reading the script oh and another thing staging of action was terrible people appearing from nowhere regularly like the girls turn around and there s an elaborate candle lit setup with a mystic native american woman just sitting there about to go into a speech sets were terrible couldn t get away from the fact that it was all obviously based in a set which really didn t help also there was consistently snow outside the camp but not a trace inside on the set arrghh so bad i really was hoping it would be at least as good as the second one
i love henry james books and washington square was no exception i was very excited to see a new movie coming out based on the book of that title jennifer jason lee is an exceptional actress and ben chaplin good enough to play the lead roles albert finney is miscast and doesn t carry the role well i wanted to shoot maggie smith or rather her silly insipid role the real problem and what s lacking in this latest version is a good script music and direction i fell asleep in the theater watching this long drawn out and exceptionally boring movie there are more pauses in the dialog than a pinter play in the book i felt a deep caring for catherine sloper and her life the movie had just the opposite effect i also disliked the twist where her aunt has a sexual attraction to morris eeeeeeeek yuk watch it if you can t sleep it s a definite snoozer don t watch it if you re depressed you ll need zoloft after this sure the heiress was exceptional with olivia haviland and montgomery clift in the title roles the actor who played her father was on the mark as the uncaring cold father still grieving for his dead wife and hating catherine for it the movie was not faithful to the book but neither is this one this movie was a box office flop i have no doubts as to why
how do comments like the one that was the headline by high school girls even make it on this site this was the stupidest movie i have ever seen it was ridiculous how can any moron sit there and say that just because a movie makes you jump it is a good movie that might be the most idiotic thing i have ever heard i could sneak up behind you and go boo and it would make you jump but that does not mean i am qualified to write or direct a movie not to mention they tied everything together at the end is not a good reason for a movie to be well received what kind of movie would it be if they didn t tie everything together i guess that would make it half a movie not a whole movie so basically this idiot girl is complimenting them for finishing the movie well i love how the youth of today hold the media and production companies to such a high standard no wonder the political system of this country can get away with whatever they want we have idiots like that coming up in our country what would happen if this girl actually ends up leading something someday that is a scary thought get a life and go watch a real movie sometime try shawshank redemption or on the waterfront or something like that and don t comment that it was boring after you see it just use what little brain god gave you to analyze it a little
you gotta love the cheesy low budget movies this one comes complete with bad effects props and bad acting really bad plus every time i see mercedes mcnab the sister i keep thinking watch out she s a vamp for those that know buffy angel a perfect example of what happens when someone with bad taste and wants to waste money making a flick the little that was spent of course i don t know if i feel more sorry for the writer of the movie or the producer who didn t make back any money i d say it s good for little kids in it s simplicity but i don t know if i d want to subject a kid to it umm because that s the lowest it will go
this film has all the earmarks of too many cooks spoiling the stew based on shielah graham s autobiography it seems like the powers that be couldn t leave well enough alone they couldn t decide if this was to be graham s story or fitzgerald s story and also how much they should soft pedal whoever s story it turned out to be so a film that could have been a story about two fascinating fitzgerald and notorious ms graham personalities becomes a dreary disjointed soap opera about that tells us little about either added to this there is absolutely no period feel other than for clumsy scene follows clumsy scene and we have no idea where we are in the story or how much time is passing however and this saved the film for me kerr has never looked lovelier and peck is as always a very handsome man they truly make a beautiful mature couple and i only wish they had better material to work with there is one scene that does work scott goes after shielah while in a drunken state and to see these two normally refined stars knock each other around is very disturbing and gives some fleeting idea of what goes on in a relationship such as theirs other than that the movie is a wasted opportunity and achieves nowhere near the classic stature of other wald produced soaps of the peyton place the best of everything
republic pictures comes late in the game to the werewolf er werecat genre the plot has a writer returning to paris after a long trip abroad during which he developed jungle fear during which he had blackouts he is arriving to great acclaim as his novel that parallels an infamous trial is a best seller the french government wants to know if he had access to secret documents something that seems more likely when an official is killed by a catman suspicion really falls on the writer when his fianc ends up dead complicating matters is the return of the blackouts so the writer doesn t know if he s the killer or not okay thriller is much too leisurely to be fully enjoyed there are too many musical numbers early on and too much dead time when things are all talk in the middle and later sections the acting is fine and the sets quite good but there is a reason why most people i know only remember the top hatted killer he s the most interesting thing in this film despite its short running time just over an hour i think the reason that this film was rarely seen on tv was that after minutes you begin to lose patience with it as good as the talk is i just wished someone would do something when it finally did happen in the closing minutes it was too little too late take a pass
boris karloff is matthias morteval a dying lonely old nut who lives in morhenge mansion with some servants and tells his doctor friend don t try to doctor me doctor i m disgustingly healthy he invites his nieces and nephews to his home and warns them they may have inherited a genetic disease that causes madness by shrinking the brain spoilers morteval karloff ends up dying and murderous toys designed by his dead brother start killing off the relatives a mini cannon fires real bullets into a guys face a life sized knight in armor attacks with an axe and a dancing sheik stabs people with a knife one guy getting strangled makes some hilarious faces at the end julissa and her boyfriend find karloff is still alive and hiding out in the dungeon where steel gates seal off the room he plays the recurring organ theme music sort of a death rattle used for the killings the brother s spirit starts talking the whole house will go with me and the mansion goes up in flames this senseless mess is too dark boring and the stupid dialogue never matches the lips
this trashy b movie attempts to masquerade as a study of sexual addiction but it is really a poor excuse for a sexploitation flick the story revolves around sammy horn subtle name played by michael des barres sammy is a restaurant owner with a clueless wife grace rosanna arquette and a young child he has a sexual addiction and must have meaningless sex every five minutes with any woman in his field of vision who will agree and of course every woman on the planet finds him irresistible despite the fact that he looks old enough to be collecting social security the story is centered on a conversation with his therapist nastassja kinski where he is describing each of his sexual exploits via flashback this is nothing more than a convenient launching point for a parade of serial sex acts which consumes at least of the screen time it is hard to know where to begin criticizing a film this bad the production values are abysmal the movie is shot on video with a look somewhere between a tv soap opera at best and an amateur porn flick shot in someone s garage the direction by joseph brutsman is horrible with bad lighting uninspired framing and poor actor direction the script is vapid and the dialogue mindless and vulgar women are generally portrayed as sex obsessed nymphomaniacs just waiting for an addict like sammy to come along and rough them up while feeding their insatiable appetites with some impersonal copulation as an example grace s sister comes over to indignantly inform sammy that she knows he s been sleeping around and that she is going to tell his wife his response to that is to throw her up against the wall and begin raping her about three seconds into it she has an epiphany and is instantly converted to one of his sex disciples begging him to give her more just as they finish grace walks in and sis says to her oh great to see you gotta run to pick up timmy and mum s the word about sammy s indiscretions the bond of loyalty has been sealed with a good ravishment no spoiler here because it is so typical of the obvious nature of the film that anyone who had seen the first fifteen minutes could have predicted it the sex depictions are all overdone mechanical and so poorly simulated that they are more comical than erotic most of them are done with both participants fully clothed the acting is wretched michael des barres presents all the depth of a rain puddle he really seems to get into the thrusting and profanity of the sex parts but when it comes to actually acting with arquette and kinski he is adrift rosanna arquette is the closest thing to an actor in this film giving a bearable performance and looking genuinely hurt when she finally discovers that her perfect husband is a lecherous animal nastassja kinski is far too compassionate as the therapist but at least we have some acting happening here the rest of the cast is just a collection of elevated body doubles to whom they give thought provoking lines like hit me harder is that the best you can do and oh god yes this movie is among the worst i have ever seen a dubious distinction given the thousands of films i have viewed i have given it the extremely rare dishonor of rating it not to be seen within three hours of any meal
this film is the worst excuse for a motion picture i have ever seen to begin i d like to say the the front cover of this film is by all means misleading if you think you are about to see a truly scary horror film with a monster clown you are soooo wrong in fact the killers face doesn t even slightly resemble the front cover it s just an image they must have found on google and thought it looked cool speaking of things they found and thought it looked cool there is a scene in this film where some of the gang are searching for the friend in the old woods then suddenly the screen chops to a scene where there is a mother deer nurturing it s young in a glisten of sunlight i mean seriously wtf how is this relevant to the dark woods they are wandering through i bought this film from a man at a market hoping it would be entertaining if it wasn t horror then at least it would be funny right wrong the next day i gave it to my work colleague ridding myself from the plague named s i c kbottom line is don t see this film
sky captain is possibly the best awful movie i ve seen in a long while rife with amazing cg and special effects studded with an a list cast jude law gwyneth paltrow angelina jolie and the infinitely likable giovanni ribisi and racing along with an overused but indiana jones esquire storyline this should have been a great movie to watch should have being the key term here of course jude law plays joe the sky captain with a dashing accent and plenty of over the shoulder heart melting smirks but you can t make something out of nothing and even his flippant deliveries and boyish good looks can t save the movie s stone dialogue if he had slapped giovanni ribisi on the back and said good boy dex just one more time i might have barfed all over the guy in front of me gwyneth paltrow as polly perkins is nothing less than nerve grating her nasal whining and not quite sarcastic comments get old in the first ten minutes of the movie perhaps she put too much effort into playing the stereotypical s comic book heroine who knows i expected more from her an example of how a similar character was played and played well is in the late s flick the phantom starring kristy swanson and billy zane rent the movie and you ll know what i mean giovanni ribisi and angelina jolie were the saving graces in the film angelina jolie was incredibly hot in that eyepatch i ll admit it in just a few short scenes both actors somehow managed to rise above the tired material and deliver a more riveting performance than their dry two dimensional castmates the plot and steady story progression were old boring and basically just a monotonous combination of every good scene from an action movie in the past thirty years the pace is rapid fire in the first half of the movie and a snail s pace in the second giving the audience enough time not only to guess the eventual conclusion of the film but to figure out who the key villain is as well the pairing is rather clich d also polly perkins and sky captain apparently reunite after several years of separation from a bitterly ended romance and their story isn t so much charming and eclectic as it is annoying and mismatched when they finally come to terms with their mutual feelings towards the end of the film nobody s surprised and nobody really cares either props to the director for appreciating bai ling enough to dress her in skintight vinyl for the entirety of the film and also for the intriguing sepia tones that served as coloration throughout but sky captain despite having all the essential elements of being a great movie falls flat on its face not even worth the i paid to get into the theater
i wasn t sure whether to laugh or cry porretta was good looking but resembled like a mexican porn star not an english outlaw costumes what costumes a t shirt with strips of black leather on it it was marion s clothes or lack of them that really got me do the fans of this stinker really believe women dressed like that in medieval england the mongols and vikings were inaccurate and stupid but the episode with an alien was worst of all especially as his make up mainly consisted of oatmeal on his face an old trick the hedgehog monster was pretty funny as was climbing up the side of a castle on a ladder of arrows as if the us accents grated as did the initial drawling voice over raw bin hood and liddle john the second robin and marion were really quite minging in looks and what was left of the show went totally down the pan
the acting in the film is really well done honestly but the movie is so slow and so boring as soon as it gets interesting everything slows to a major halt i am glad to see sam rockwell in this he did a great job so did the other actors as i mentioned but man this is one of the worst dragged out films i have ever seen now maybe in a short film form this movie would be good but other than that avoid it this film has so much filler it makes a twinkie cake jealous i never ever walk out on films but watching this one at home with family i walked out yeah it was that boring apparently my comment doesn t have enough lines to post so here s some more filler i guess i was inspired by the movie i just watched
this was one of the most ridiculous and badly directed movies i ve seen in a very long time i ve never liked spike lee but thought i d give this one a try bad mistake the movie is supposed to show how the son of sam real life murders affected a neighborhood in the summer of what it really did was center around the most boring characters that i doubt anyone cared for as far as their drug problems marriage problems and so on etc the scenes that depict the murders are just that and nothing more a shooting and then it s back to saturday night fever what s even more ridiculous is spike lee s choice to show up as a reporter in the movie spike trust me you re no hitchcock stay out of the movies it makes them even worse off the most silly scene had to be the dog speaking in a goofy voice which was depicted in a scene before it where it was supposed to have been shot spike what were you thinking when you made this film not thinking at all is my guess people who think they ll see a crime drama take my advice and do not waste your time or money on this loser you re better off watching jerry springer in this case waste of film i gave it a out of awful dud
i couldn t not recommend a christmas movie more than this worthless piece of drivel trust me double negatives are required here it s that bad this film was in trouble from the opening credits when it was revealed that the screenwriter was the same person as the songwriter the musical numbers are all far too long and none of them any good thank you very much has a decent melody but the lyrics are stupid beyond words i would gladly bear the chains worn by scrooge in the film s bizarre hell sequence than sit through this insult to movie musicals again the only entertaining part of this movie completely unintentional by the way involves alec guinness as jacob marley dressed in a silly powder white costume guinness foppishly prances through his scenes in what was either an attempt to make it appear as though he was floating like a ghost or to show his utter disdain with having to be in this dreadful movie albert finney meanwhile blends the best of alistar sim and charles laughton to create his hopelessly loathsome character of quasimodo scrooge finney s scrooge is so hideous a person it s impossible to believe his transformation steer clear of this abomination of filmmaking at all costs
fred claus somehow avoids becoming this year s the santa clause by at least having a bit more amusing moments than that tim allen starrer but it doesn t mean that it s got enough going for it that s worth a trip to the theater as holiday movies go it s contrived and sentimental but actually that could be the least of one s concern as fred claus boasting of having david dobkin shanghai knights the wedding crashers at the helm contains virtually nary a genuinely funny moment as it clumsily treads the line between a boorish vince vaughn vehicle and a fuzzy christmas film in the end it amounts to not much of both and with a cast that comprises of paul giamatti kevin spacey rachel weisz and kathy bates all the more it leaves one disappointed vaughn plays fred nick s giamatti older and estranged brother who once upon a time left him and their parents bates and trevor peacock after having had enough of enduring his parents favoritism of his younger sibling nick grows up to be santa claus and as the voice over tells us time freezes on you and your family when you become a saint while fred becomes a yuletide jaded repo man in chicago who s having a hard time remembering his girlfriend wanda s weisz birthday he runs in trouble with the law and had to call his younger brother who eerily looks at least a decade older than him to bail him out of jail nick agrees but only if fred agrees to help out on the toy wrapping business up in the north pole fred reluctantly agrees but his cynicism clashes with santa and the elves perpetually cheery nature even as an efficiency expert spacey is checking on the toy factory operations only too happy to have the whole arctic operations shut down if things fail the film as said does have its moments but the padded running length stretches them thin across its duration in between are piles of christmas film clich s that were handled better in say elf and the attempts at sentimentality are as endearing as last year s fruitcake vaugn as usual brings on his coarse charm to the table but the neutered script of dan fogelman keeps him from really doing his thing giamatti underneath the bad fat suit brings a jolly old charm to his iconic character but unfortunately has to play second fiddle to fred spacey brings his game face but his turns usually end as unfunnily vapid ultimately fred claus becomes a forgettable film that falls below what those involved in it deserve sure there are worse ways to start the season at the cinema but there are certainly far better ways
wow i can t believe just how bad zombie doom aka violent sh t really is i d heard the rumors read the reviews but had to make my mind up for myself well let me tell ya it blows the worst acting of any film ever made dubbing that must have been done while everyone involved was completely wasted inept and laughable gore fx no discernible plot cinematography that looks like my grandma filmed it with her camcorder weapons props that are no joke made out of tin foil the list goes on and on three guys get stranded on an island where a bunch of weirdos run around with plastic and tin foil swords two of the captives are freed along with a rebel of the island freaks and are given a day s head start before they are hunted down by the rest of the tribe that s pretty much it honestly this is one of the worst films i ve ever had the misfortune to subject myself too the budget had to be about and was spent entirely on the gore fx which actually may not have been a bad idea there is nothing to zombie doom other than strung together ridiculous looking gore scenes with lots of horribly dubbed dialog this film makes other no budget outings like premutos lord of the living dead look like titanic some may rank zd in the so bad it s good category and i guess if you re really drunk or high and watching it with a few friends mst k style i guess it could be looked at that way but not by me i hated pretty much everything about it if zombie doom or zombie which is equally appalling and is included as a bonus on the shock o rama release of zd is indicative of andreas schnaas other works then he should be banned from ever having anything to do with making a film ever again under penalty of death there is one amusing kung fu battle in the latter half of the film and a lot of blood so i ll grant this one a very generous do yourself a favor and skip this
bradford dillman plays a scientist who wakes up one morning in the middle of a bloody crime scene having partial amnesia or global amnesia which one character claims to define as elective loss of memory the scientist finds a private detective in the phone book in the hopes of piecing his life back together abhorrent concoction very loosely based on walter ericson s book fallen angel filmed in as mirage with gregory peck it was probably too racy for television what with drugs and hippies added to the mix that nbc initially refused to air it which is how this low budgeter wound up in theaters director james goldstone gets freaky with the hyperkinetic visuals and camera tricks while editor edward a biery goes wild with the zig zag cuts unfortunately their admittedly colorful gimmicks cannot cover up the weaknesses of this updated plot and the acting is woefully overripe dillman under pressure to recall the events of the night in question goes through an actor s seminar of tics stammers nose wipes and crazy half laughs while spitting out dialogue like dream a dream drugs yeah drugs that sound bells help as a villainous fellow scientist with a cheshire cat smile pat hingle nearly upstages dillman in the grand thespian department by continually addressing everyone in baby talk strutting about like a middle aged peacock and twisting his mouth around in agony hope lange s scientist love interest is given the short shrift but not before she screams at indifferent lover dillman what do i have to do talk ape man me want you this is one frantic jigsaw from
and how many actors can he get to stand in for his own neurotic compulsive uber new yorker persona in this film woody is played by will ferrell in what is mercifully less a direct impersonation than the one kenneth branagh did in celebrity it s an annoyingly repetitive story now nebbishy neurotic man with a wife or girlfriend falls madly in love with a shiksa queen upon which he projects all manner of perfection everyone lives in perfect gigantic apartments in great manhattan neighborhoods everyone constantly patronizes expensive exclusive restaurants during which all the characters relate fascinating anecdotes and discuss arcane philosophy there is always a trip to the hamptons during which the nebbishy main character spazzes out about sand and physical exertion and possible exposure to diseases and then of course said main character feels guilty about his lust for the shiksa queen but pursues her anyway sometimes succeeding sometimes failing etc this a tired formula and proof that allen isn t really a great film artist at all he just seems like a dirty old man with the libido and emotions of a year old who is intent upon telling the same boring old stories again and again
a very slick modern keeping it sensually hip revamp on the dracula story although staying with the traditional customs with quite an interesting if not fully grasped back story of the prince of darkness the first time i tried watching it i could only make it halfway through before losing interest again it gets off to a good start especially the scenes with the thieves and then their encounters with dracula but then for me it got less involving when it hits new orleans to focus on van helsing s daughter a great place to set it but never took advantage of its settings despite etching a paradise in damn where dracula could flourish produced by wes carven and yeah they throw that name out there but written directed by patrick lussier artistically it had its moments with few dreamlike visuals but some kinetic editing and cheap jolts don t help the messy script does get considerably silly lussier does a polished job that remains rather glassy inserting a lot of blood the make up is suitably achieved and a lot of virgin advertising no i don t mean virgins it s the music company as it does get in numerous shots and helsing s daughter works there too oh that wasn t obvious planting the soundtrack is an amusing choice of rock tunes now the performances are all over the shop but there are few familiar faces to spot danny masterson sean patrick thomas nathan fillion shane west and lochlyn munro gerard butler as dracula just didn t come off as not much of a presence was formed he was simply out shined by the succulent ladies of the night jennifer esposito colleen fitzpatrick and jeri ryan as dracula s brides the likes of jonny lee millar and justine waddell are respectably okay christopher plummer gives out a grizzled turn as van helsing and omar epps has fun with his role
this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen while featuring good actors the movie doesn t live up to the expectations the most dramatic thing about this movie is the music which pretty much sums up the movie compensating for a bad and confusing storyline by having known good actors loud and dramatic music it doesn t change the fact that this is a very boring movie to watch earned itself a score of
i really looked forward to seeing nana after seeing renoir amazing debut work whirlpool of fate i had read that nana was generally considered his best silent film so i had high hopes sadly this felt like a huge step backwards catherine hessling is the main problem with this film her acting is over the top even for a silent film her acting is more like what one would expect in a film from the early teens not the late s she usually has the same face which reminds me sorry to say of someone with constipation pains it was also very difficult to believe that any man would fall for this femme fatale there was nothing charming about her at all the film was also quite long drawn the camera work was uninteresting aside from a shot of a horse race and the editing was dull the story reminded me of pabst s pandora s box it is interesting to compare the two because there are only years between these films pandora s box simply scores on every level where nana fails this film is only for renoir completists or very serious silent films buffs
okay the film festival crowd probably loved it but your average popcorn munching movie goer who has scraped to gether the ten or fifteen bucks it costs to see a movie these days will probably wonder why he or she made this choice if it s stamped copolla it s automatically great stuff right wrong it s a neat spoof of filmdom s pretensions but it s terribly in i worry when film makers are more concerned about entertaining themselves rather than the public it s interesting as a cinematic curio and it does have a chuckle or two in it but once it s run its course in the movies and on tv the dust will grow thick on the film cans and tape boxes holding it hardly either epochal or an epic
scooby doo is undoubtedly one of the most simple successful and beloved cartoon characters in the world so what happens when you ve been everywhere and done everything with the formula you switch it up right wrong you stop production and let it rest for a decade or so and then run it again keeping the core of its success intact that is to say stick with the formula for the most part but add your particular flavour to it this to me is why what s new scooby doo worked they want back to the classic scooby doo formula which had only successfully resurfaced a decade earlier in a pup named scooby doo but for the most part had not been tapped since the original scooby doo where are you the first sign to me of a weak offering is the inclusion of extraneous characters there might be a few fond memories from past iterations but generally if you think scooby doo you aren t thinking of film flam scrappy doo or scooby dum even worse the exclusion of the other core members of mystery inc generally indicate a group of production people who don t understand from a kids point of view how the show works the basic premise has always been a group of people who are diametrically opposed getting together and through their own individual stereotyped qualities manage to surmount the tasks given at hand this next paragraph is just my theorizing so skip it if you want i hope that i can explain why i think fiddling around with the basic elements of the show are detrimental with my interpretation of what the gang represents and how they contribute to the whole fred represents the driver i think in general it is the purpose of fred to give the group direction organization and sub tasks fred isn t a happy go lucky teenager he s your boss your teacher your dad your authority figure fred moves without hesitation and is driven by tasks problem always equals solution for fred in many ways fred is the antithesis to shaggy shaggy is your best friend that guy who is just a little more afraid of things than you are he enables you to be brave to not be at the back of the pack shaggy represents emotion and is frequently showing emotional extremes from elation to fear velma represents rational thought she applies logic but as we see time and again on the show she requires clues that for the most part are collected in pieces by the other members of the show left on her own would velma solve a mystery the group often finds itself in situations where truths aren t obvious and only through chance encounters do they achieve the necessary information to complete their task chance is represented by daphne at one point i think it is the first scooby doo series she was known as danger prone writers have used daphne to link unrelated events together through accident she frequently is the one who finds the secret door collection of objects or some other detail that can help the gang link clues together finally scooby himself represents us the participant he is always in the centre of events capable of all the things the rest of the gang are capable of yet handicapped because he is not human and much like us the television viewer is unable to truly participate scooby doo works because all these personified elements of problem solving are immediately identifiable and entertaining maybe i m over thinking things but in my life i ve seen a lot of scooby doo being a year old self proclaimed nerd it kind of rolls with the territory to me there is a magic with the classic scooby doo formula that should never be messed with as many have pointed out scooby doo is not a great work of art nor is it completely trite it falls into the category of programming that can be watched by young eyes with a hearty bowl of breakfast cereal messing about with the raw simplicity transforms it into something else something lesser
words really can t describe how bad this film is i thought zandalee was bad but at least that had some nice shots and the occasional good chin stroking moment here and there to stop you from nodding off this is just laughable terrible script poor direction awful acting and you know what i can t think of a single thing to recommend about it other than the fact that it isn t too long if you want minutes worth of entertainment book yourself in at the dentist and have some root canal work far more enjoyable and much better value for money assuming that you need it incidentally i need to type lines of text to complete this review please do not buy this movie it is terrible
i couldn t believe it i had to rub my eyes a few times was it true yes there were billy dee williams jeff conaway maxwell caulfield and tracy scoggins all of them have some manner of talent but here they all were in what basically adds up to a cinemax style skin flick set on board a spaceship sad as it is alien intruder tries to be unique with a computer virus alien demon harpy whatever else you want to call her named ariel scoggins infiltrating this sort of high tech virtual reality station on board a spaceship where four men are allowed to live out their fantasies as the system is over seen by their captain williams interesting maybe but here everything just plays out like a well padded episode of red shoe diaries williams out classes everything right and left and looks like he d rather be doing anything else anywhere else ah the things people do for money the fx are pretty static maybe even less than what you d expect for a straight to video cheapie like this unfortunately even the female nudity is less than you d expect sexual innuendo is the real star here and of course it gets all the best scenes if you like a movie that s all tease and no brains check out alien intruder of course you ll probably have to look no further than cinemax at or in the morning no stars not even for what star power this flick can muster leave this one lost in space
as a kid i did think the weapon the murderer wielded was cool however i was a kid and so i was a bit dumb even as a dumb kid though the movies plot was stupid and a bit boring when the killer was not using his light knife to kill people what amazes me is that the movie has a really solid cast in it what script did they read when agreeing to be in this movie as it is most assuredly boring and only a means to show off a light saber on a very small scale the plot at times is incomprehensible and the end is totally chaotic the whole film seems to rotate around aliens and the one weapon the plot has two kids and some dude having an alien encounter flash years later and there seems to be a return as it were in the mix dead animals and such to be explored and for some reason the one dude gets the weapon of the aliens and proceeds to use it to go on a very light killing spree seriously you just have to wonder why this movie was made if you are going to have a killer have some good death scenes if you are going to have alien encounters show more than a weird light vortex thing and if you are going to have light sabers then call yourself star wars
for me the only reason for having a look at this remake was to see how bad and funny it could be there was no doubt about it being funny and bad because i had seen voyna i mir shall we begin here we go robert dornhelm brendan donnison s pierre bezukhov a lean fellow that lacks the depth of the original robert dornhelm brendan donnison s natasha rostova a scarecrow her image can cause insomnia robert dornhelm brendan donnison s andrej bolkonsky an ok incarnation which like the lean fellow cf above lacks depth of a russian soul and struggle within robert dornhelm brendan donnison s napoleon a rather unimpressive leader robert dornhelm brendan donnison s prince bolkonsky a turd with an english face robert dornhelm brendan donnison s count bezukhov a spineless freak show the rest of the characters are not much better the movements of the actors and the way they look and speak are often atrocious they behave like modern eu citizens dressed up for a one day masquerade it all looks cheap and never comes close to the standards of our russian men and women of the early th century a good piece of entertainment to scrutinize and make fun of we had quite a few giggles in our office when remembering this modern product which had been shown the previous evening on our tv user rating votes i guess many young people have never watched our film voyna i mir or have weird sense of tarantino spielberg quality remember the scene when our hussar is saving his friend turns around shoots and the bridge goes boom looks like a cgi explosion there is neither sense nor craft to make a better version of the novel which was screened properly in our country once but i would be happy to watch a russian remake of gone with the wind hey directors wake up and get busy with that instead of spoiling our classics now back to common sense jokes aside what i mentioned above is nothing new though deadly exaggerated to make foreign actors trying to pass for russians while participating in very serious epics and dramas is a rude mistake and the filmmakers are making this mistake again and again of course it results in numerous laughs especially clemence poesy is uncomfortably ridiculous and her dancing and singing makes a russian viewer think this sucks so much that it s funny in order to say something new i d like to mention the pace of the movie to my mind this new version is very patchy the narration and the scenes are not naturally flowing they stagger and pop up like in a modern video again i have to remember our voyna i mir where the action is so natural and the narration is so easy that you simply sit back and enjoy going with the flow i thought that maybe the borodino battle would be great to somehow rehabilitate numerous drawbacks but it has turned out to be no match for the war scenes filmed in there should be something good in this movie after all and there is the actors seem to be trying hard to make it all work they did not have a chance from the start but they still joined the losers team plus point for that recklessness it makes a russian viewer uncomfortable some scenes are ironically ridiculous though they are intended to be dramatically powerful and the actors are doing their best it all evokes pity and sometimes fits of laughter what i still like about this serial is the last part of it it shows very vividly how everybody gets his or her salary and taxes besides judging by the movie trailers i thought that the film would have an adult sex scene which would definitely kill the whole project but fortunately it does not have such rubbish and that s a big plus voyna i mir is no harry potter and nowadays even we here in present day russia do not have enough craft to film it properly do i have to say that the moral quality of our life has deteriorated immensely fortunately a proper film was screened during our soviet times the american version of the s was justified to some extent ours did not even exist yet there were extenuating circumstances then out of point is given from the start point goes for the recklessness and points for the last part of the serial thanks for attention
please take a minute to read my entire review i am not knocking the film itself only the dvd versions currently available i really wanted to give this film even two stars i mean how could it possibly rank a mere out of here s how an epic film adaptation of tolstoy s novel war and peace with historically accurate battle scenes courtesy of the red army and an extremely faithful scene for scene adaptation of the novel would be difficult but worth sitting through for seven hours if that s what you were seeing the trouble is you can t see that film anywhere as far as i know i am attempting to watch the ruscico dvd version widely considered the best version available since it s letter boxed and restores the scenes that were cut from other dvd releases but it is one of the worst film prints i ve ever seen transfered to dvd the picture is muddy and inconsistent often strobing it s almost tolerable if you crank your brightness color and picture levels up to maximum but the problem doesn t end there the sound is also way inconsistent blaringly loud in parts virtually inaudible in others and as for languages it s a huge problem for english speakers the dubbed option has some good actors and some really terrible ones whose performance grates and parts of the film just aren t dubbed at all slipping back into russian and even french randomly the subtitled option isn t much better the subtitles don t appear below the image but right over it obscuring some of the beauty or what s left of it in the scenery furthermore the subtitles are often a poor translation a shame given that the script took pains to hew so close to tolstoy s actual words and the subtitles too seem to just drop out in parts so even if you max out the color brightness and picture settings and turn the volume way up and choose subtitled and english dubbed you re still going to get a film that s annoying to watch and listen to can it s content overcome that it might have been able to but at seven hours who can stand it for that long maybe someday someone will come along and restore this and maybe then i will see a masterpiece but for now i just can t give more than one star to something i ve only been able to stand watching about the first of
i put this movie on in the hotel room to entertain my children the morning we were leaving to go home because i had packed away all their toys toddlers don t like to watch regis and kathie lee or the view my four year old found one scene funny but told me the rest of it was too silly this is a four year old folks anyone over the age of say nine will want to kill their television rather than let this one play itself out to say this movie is bad is like saying the holocaust was a little mistake there are no words for how ridiculous and utterly terrible this film truly is the acting is bad the plot is stupid and the script is pathetically unfunny since this is supposed to be a comedy the fact that you cannot even laugh at the badness of the movie makes it even worse bronson balki pinchot is the worst with some weird fake accent irish pakistani bronx cockney cajun as far as i could tell but all the characters are awful i haven t watched a real laurel and hardy film in ages but i know that they had to be way better than this what is the point of ruining a classic comic duo with this bottom line derivative garbage avoid at all costs unless you have some freaky bronson pinchot fetish
this whole film should have lasted minutes maximum although an interesting concept theme it really did not develop as a story once the initial idea of a brave stupid bomb disposal expert cowboy are introduced and this happens very early in the film the rest is repetitious characters were not explored and aspects of the location and politics were ignored there was some nice insight into the appalling difficulties faced by troops in such a foreign environment and the difficulties in differentiating between friend and foe but the way in which the unit operated stretched belief individual performances were good and special effects were adequate but not enough to overcome the basic lack of content
this film is awful the cgi is the very cheap gray blob cgi the crocodile looks like a large gray smudge the worst is that no effort at all is given to making it walk or look like it is alive it is mostly a photo shopped cgi that is placed into scenes and you almost expect to see the hand that is moving the cgi smudge across the screen this is one of the worst examples of cgi effects that i have ever witnessed and i have seen lots of the very bad sci fi channel movies aside from the terrible lack of special effects the cast is composed of the typical low cost actors who probably work as waiters waitresses at local diners while they wait for their big breaks perhaps the most ridiculous scene in this movie is when one of the bad guys is attempting to sexually assault kate and the giant crocodile jumps straight up out of the water to the second floor of the villains headquarters and through the balcony and pulls the bad guy off kate and instead of crashing straight down through the building and crushing kate the croc just flies backwards at the same angle into the water no laws of physics can apply to this movie or the special effects at least there is honor among crocodiles
i went into this movie hoping for the best i like wartime musicals in general dick powell and lucille ball did good jobs with their roles however the writers gave them boring dialog the love interest between the two of them was not given any real growth just suddenly it was there i did not think much of the music the best number was the snippet we heard of spike jones with der fuhrer s face the one complete number that spike jones did had little of his great musical comedy pretty tame stuff even with the monkey bert lahr s comedy skits were interminable there were parts to enjoy lucille ball was quite a looker and there was a good selection of bit players who really deserved more time on screen
this extremely weak australian excuse for a motion picture is sort of like the pavlov dog experiment amongst horror movies you remember this famous conditioned reflex experiment from your school books right the russian scientist pavlov proved that dogs tended to salivate before the food actually came into their mouths and this through repetitive routines stimulating the animal s reflexes pavlov rung a bell a couple of instants before the food was delivered to the dog and after a while he became anxious and excited and already started salivating from hearing the sound of the bell what the hell has this whole boring explanation in common with a sleazy and low budgeted aussie slasher flick i hear you think well the modus operandi of the maniacal killer in nightmares is an exact variant on pavlov s experiment each and every single murder sequence is preceded by the raw sound and image of the killer breaking a window because he she insists on using a sharp piece of glass to slice up the victims so this means that after a short while inattentive and bored viewers can afford to doze off and simply look up again when they hear the sound of shattering glass that way they still don t miss anything special regarding the quality of nightmares as a film i can be very brief this is a cheap uninspired and largely imbecilic aussie cash in on the contemporary popular trend of american slasher movies in the early s a four year old witnesses the cruel death of her mother as her throat gets slit open in a nasty car accident twenty years later the same girl helen selleck is a successful stage actress but she still has severe mental issues and regularly suffers from horrible flashbacks and traumatic nightmares she auditions for a role in a black comedy play revolving on death and gets the part shortly after the big premiere everyone who s even remotely involved with the production gets slaughtered it is truly retarded how this movie attempts to uphold the mystery regarding the killer s identity and motivations even though even the most infantile viewer can figure it out after the first murder already i don t think i ve ever seen a more obvious whodunit than nightmares and the creators should have just showed his her face straight away and save themselves from embarrassment the murders are explicit and very bloody and there s also an unhealthy large amount of gratuitous nudity to enjoy however the production values are poor and thus the movie is never at one point shocking or provocative the few clips we get to see of the actual play make it appear that it quite possible could be the worst thing ever performed on stage the only positive elements in the film are the characters of the director and the gay newspaper critic whom are both delightfully sarcastic and insult the rest of the cast members as much as we do nightmares is a dreadful piece of exploitative horror cinema but hey at least i gave you a golden tip to make it more digestible
some people don t like the animation personally i think the animation was quite remarkable given when this movie was done there are lots of older cartoons that i just love my problems with this movie are not the animation but basically the way it was constructed the characters are all just well goofy and for this movie they shouldn t be apparently everyone in lotr has a limping problem for starters just the way they acted in general annoyed me my two sisters and i were laughing through most of this movie i think that if many people had seen this before seeing the newer ones they wouldn t have gone i m glad i rented this and didn t buy it there are few movies that give me a headache this was one of them however this isn t the worst movie i ve ever seen although it ranks up there or down there depending on your view
blank check is easily one of the worst films of the nineties the plot is completely pointless its overtones of lonliness are pathetic do you really believe a twelve year old acting as a personal assistant for a millionaire could accomplish everything in this film like buying a mansion for a mere grand the notion let alone the bargain basement price will only be believed by the most gullible viewers please respect your intelligence and don t watch this awful awful film
the writers probably had no experience in the army and probably never glanced at a history book but i still give this cheaply produced war film some credit for taking a long needed look at the role of black soldiers in the second world war the action is confused and unbelievable any episode of combat has better production values but the cast is interesting seeing new york giant rosie greer was worth the buck i paid for this the art direction is fifth rate the men wear korean war uniforms and it was pretty lousy weather by the time the u s army reached germany in not sunny as they show here and i don t think the terrain resembled northern california the script never does make clear why the black support troops are used as combat soldiers there is a nice touch that shows some of the men carrying springfield rifles instead of m s which second rate troops probably would have been issued with this basic story idea racist southern officer commanding black troops should have been expanded into a big budget production back then and its not too late to try it now you have to take this for what it is and i admire the creators of this film for making the effort i remember seeing this a while ago and thinking it was set in italy which would have made more sense because there were black combat troops operating there in
ok ok it might be hard to put the entirety of a man s life in one film traditionally therefore biopics focus on one or two significant parts in the subject s life now byron was a my week beats your year fellow which makes selecting parts that are representative even harder furthermore just as byron s poetry is inseparable from his life the man s life itself must be seen as a whole lifting parts out is not only not showing the whole picture it s showing a different picture altogether now in short my review comes down to this supposedly byron was indeed the my week beats your year prototype a guy who lived so intensely that he indeed did more in his or so active years than most do in an entire lifetime true he had setbacks and was a victim of the time and social setting he lived in but in the end this dude is supposed to be the prototype whose life we d all want to lead no well i did not at any moment want to live the life depicted in this film so it gets not for being so badly done which direction wise it more or less was but more importantly for missing the point entirely in a flat plot some more detail well to over simplify things a byron bio should have two distinct episodes post first europe trip england and his rise to fame marriage his life abroad now the important thing is that the second part should be at least as important as the first not only was it a lot longer but the most significant change in byron took place then furthermore it s where he created his best works don juan the vision of judgement etc all the stuff that makes him really unique in english literature instead in this film a byron s life never comes across as even remotely entertaining b it only gets worse after he leaves england they did two good jobs first they started at his return of his europe trip though a bit more of the actual trip would have been welcome as a prologue second they chose an angle and they chose his incestuous love for augusta who is rather perfectly cast the problem with this last thing is that they never let it go true byron remained strongly attached to augusta for the rest of his life but especially as he was such a mood swing person the fact that his letters reflect that does not mean that at other times he might not have completely enjoyed life anyway the first part of the tv film should have ended with him leaving england there s no doubt about that the thing is once abroad a life of debauchery began with the infamous geneva period but in italy byron also discovered a new life both for his poetry inspired by italian comedy already in venice and for himself when he found the contessa teresa guiccioli and moved to ravenna afterwards at the request of shelly with teresa to pisa in other words he was also liberated his mind and life opened up and not only in the decadent sense while england s closed further as it fell into the gravitational pull of the victorian age true freedom was augusta less but this bitter sweet freedom tastes sour in this film we see a lonely bored snob getting older i mean hell byron never thought much about his poetry except when he finally found his own voice in don juan apart from poetic and romantic developments his relationship with shelly and the down break should have been more documented also it is in italy in ravenna that he gets involved with politics and revolutionary ideas this is important as it shows that the decadent romantic and ultimately escapist language and person of childe harold is changing into the more planted in life realistic and lighter passion of the language and person of don juan life and work are one true still a bit naive but it s what got him to greece and the whole thing came full circle in pisa where shelley s revolutionary spirit further ignited the spark missolonghi wasn t the bored snob suddenly looking for some action it was the insights in italy the gambas stirring him into action it can be a symbol for the man looking for some ancient style battle excitement while the rest of europe becomes fixed in the clay of modern reason and conservatism but it wasn t just that there was a true inspiration behind it meanwhile byron wrote massive amounts of don juan true his end is a bit sad but it s not like he s worn out that is the essence of byron s life he may have had some strong emotional attachments augusta and teresa but every time he managed to reinvent himself truly meaning that he wasn t less at the end of his life no he d made a physical and mental journey that at the time few people were prepared to make i wonder why is it that so often the second period in byron s life is overlooked because it had less obvious conflicts as the man was finally coming to his own in focusing our attention on the frustrated england years fraught with scandals we show ourselves to be not much better than the english aristocracy at the time which byron so despised and which despite the fact that he had no choice he willingly fled in to find a world that was modern and liberal enough to let him find the voice that would make him the first romantic plainspoken language poet and evolve from a self obsessed snob to a passionate man moving onward with a cause
quite simply this shouldn t have been made it s predictable and clich d the on screen chemistry which made the first my girl so captivating is nowhere to be found here and the acting as a whole is stilted and forced the writing also leaves much to be desired some of the memorable lines such as earpeircing a barbaric custom are just shocking where my girl provoked a genuine feelings of sadness and some genuinely funny moments like so many sequels my girl tries to recreate these emotions generated by the audience and fails miserably maybe i m being hard on this film because of how great the first one was but quite honestly it insults the quality of the original with the sort of drivel this installment serves up surely this has to come close to son of the mask as being one of the worst sequels of all time in both cases the old saying rings true if it ain t broke don t fix it
saw this piece of work at a film fest in ca my god what was the director thinking film professors should use this film as a case study on what not to do when making a short film first off this project makes absolutely no sense whatsoever the film takes place partially in the waystation some stupid vapid bar in the middle of nowhere where nothing really takes place the acting is beyond bad so bad in fact that i almost thought it was a comedy the lead actress julia reading is a step below the acting in most amateur porn films there is one or two decent performances including the guys who played jacob and fenner but it s like the director had no clue on how to work or use his thespians the only thing worse than the acting was the dialogue which bordered on absurd the writer whom i assume is also the director writes each character like they are auditioning for a comic book villain the overall production value is pretty good but to be honest with a film this bad it s easy to overlook it the production design is pretty good although the waystation looks like any ordinary bar the costumes and make up are okay and i understand the production was working with a low budget it s just when the characters speak or they try and push the plot forward the film unravels into a muck of crap as i ve said this film is god awful it s like the director writer watched a lot of sci fi films and threw all the parts he liked into a blender and came up with this my only hope is that he used other people s money on this because if he used his own he s a total sucker
i had a lot of expectations from this movie and more so since it was a yashraj film jimmy operates a call centre and one day he is invited by pooja singh to teach her boss lakhan singh english the two fall in love and decide to run away but pooja tells jimmy that she can t do this as she owes a debt to lakhan singh who is also known as bhaiyyaji but they decide and steal money from him and its only then that jimmy finds out that bhaiyyaji lakhan singh is a don in the meantime bhaiyyaji hires a man bachchan pandey to track down jimmy and pooja starring saif ali khan kareena kapoor anil kapoor and akshaye kumar the movie is directed by first time director viay krishna acharya and is produced by both aditya chopra and yash chopra tashan has to be one of the worse films that i have ever watched yes the scenery is good and kareena kapoor and her much publicised weight loss looks good but plot is extremely thin on story and at times makes no sense from one scene to the other hence why i have said at the beginning that i had expected more from this film as it was a yashraj production with reference to songs unfortunately there is not one song that i can remember now there are moments where one can laugh and that is mainly thanks to akshaye kumar and saif could have definitely done better while kareena kapoor played her part well but this cannot be said for anil kapoor it did not suit him at all as a villain lastly never mind aditya chopra who in the past has produced and directed good films such as mohabbatein what was yash chopra doing by producing such a trash movie conclusion bad movie not worth wasting your time and that is my first and last impression
this sequel is thoroughly uneven incoherent and rambling in plot if there really is one and tries too damned hard to be modern ridiculous out of period and character st century style songs predominate and cute yawn there are too many manufactured belaboured jokes with animals the actors in his film are secondary to the juvenile plot even glenn close and she is normally very good sweeps through this film parodying herself as the original de ville and the lead from sunset boulevard it s a film that isn t even good to look at this is a very good example of a bad and pointless sequel even basic instinct had a plot characterisation and acceptable acting this doesn t it is bad
william russ is the main character throughout this made for tv movie he left his family behind to only reappear and begin paying off his debts but he tries to keep away from his family thats where peter falk colombo comes in playing several different roles to convince him to come home the story is average and they actually managed to get a former star peter falk and use him to a fairly nice degree but william russ wasn t truly a star however it appears his acting is still ok i found the delivery and story very cheesy in how everything was predictable in fact the last minutes i could almost dictate word for word before it happened a good movie should never be like that overall it was a sub par movie in a letter grading system it would receive a d
hawked as the most offensive movie ever guaranteed to offend everyone guess what it worked i m offended that we shelled out money to rent this two friends and i were bored and decided to see if all that bull about the movie that we saw on tv was true curse comedy central and all the other networks that pushed this garbage on us it was by far the worst movie i ve seen since hollow man i generally avoid the crappy ones but got sucked into this one we have since beaten the prick who suggest we rent it and his movie picking privileges have been revoked there is nothing remotely funny about this movie even the adventures of dickman scene was sophomoric at best color me p ed thought maybe the production value was crap for some important reason no it just sucked never watch this for any reason whatsoever not even with copious amounts of illegal substance would this movie be funny that s saying alot please for the love of all that is holy if you cherish your sanity never view this movie it s many things stupid pointless and worthless to name a few but the main thing it was aiming for offensively funny it failed miserably crash and burn
the fight scenes were great loved the old and newer cylons and how they painted the ones on their side it was the ending that i hated i was disappointed that it was earth but k years back but to travel all that way just to start over are you kidding me k people that fought for their very existence and once they get to paradise they abandon technology no way sure they were eating paper and rationing food but that is over they can live like humans again they only have one good doctor what are they going to do when someone has a tooth ache never mind giving birth yea right no one would have made that choice
painful to watch and not entirely for empathy with the struggles of the characters two of the main characters cynthia the mother and monica the acknowledged daughter spend the great bulk of the film pathetically mewling and bitterly bitching respectively their characters are so firmly established that their redemption into tolerable personalities after a quick family catharsis is unbelievable it wasn t worth the wait i wish a worthy pitch for honesty among families was less of a headache to view
a cheesy compellingly awful and not in a fun way c grade movie everything shouts amateur from the crumby script bizarre premises limited coherence and predictable endings the turgid lighting sound and hand held wobbly camera angles the coy and passe sexual inneundo and references the patchy and unbelievable dialgoue to the z rate acting i saw it on dvd and kept hoping edward wood would pop out all is forgiven your worst films are works of art and more coherent than this twaddle but still preferable to the warbling every night in my dreams i hear you are you sure the titanic crew weren t involved in this on the side
characters you don t care about relationships you don t care about and you sit through all that to see the ending you knew was coming from the start julia roberts usually leaves no impression on me one way or the other she was actually somewhat endearing in this role
i think that the shots and lighting were very poor when i watched it for the first time i thought it was the old version when i really found out the true year of the film i was shocked i didn t know that there could be such a bad film made so recently thats really all i wanted to say this film had a good plot though nothing you couldn t miss out on if you would simply read the novel that george orwelll wrote all i really want to say has already been said except for this i can t believe that this film could have possibly received so many awards and nominations i gave this film a one awful because i felt that it was very badly made well that is all so long
hammerhead is a combination between the mad scientist and killer shark movie genres in a bit of type casting jeffrey combs plays the aforementioned mad scientist who develops a human hammerhead shark creature bizarrely this being is in fact his son who he has turned into this monster to prevent him dying from cancer or something a group of associates are invited to the scientist s private island they end up being used as shark bait or shark mate for some unknown reason the head of it has been brought along as part of this team who knows why luckily he turns out to be a resourceful if somewhat overweight ramboesque hero i m working on the assumption that he learnt how to handle an assault rifle as part of his day job working in st line support a normal day for this it man presumably involves fixing someone s network connection followed by a call to gun down gun toting evil doers or perhaps a call to fix someone s pc has to be scheduled between physical confrontations with land based human shark hybrids anyway he s amazing and saves the day he even get s the girl the shark man is a slightly lame creation but ok i guess judging by the effects in general in this film and the movie moves on at a decent pace it s complete hokum of course but if you buy a movie called hammerhead and expect it to be a complex drama about the emotional conflicts experienced by a man turned into a land based killer fish then really you have no one to blame but yourself as it is there are guns gore girls and possibly even an exploding helicopter it s rubbish but not as bad as some might say
finally i thought someone is going to do justice to h g wells s classic not another version set in the wrong locale or era but one based firmly on the book well it definitely follows the book pretty closely and that is the only plus to this mess this is min s yes hours long the book is only around pages if timothy hines had the nerve to come on here and say if you can do any better i would say yes i could and i have never used a video camera or been to any sort or drama school in my life i paid good money to get this crap over to the uk from the usa do not make the same mistake as me
i ve waited a long time to see dr tarr s torture dungeon and after i watched it i was really disappointed by it it s not the baroque film i expected it to be the trailer which i saw on a something weird dvd is much better than the entire film which is remarkably forgettable there are almost no stand out scenes in it and the look and feel is interesting but it doesn t even come close to other baroque styled movies out there from fellini or jodorowsky the characters are dull and there s almost nothing dramatic going on even though we see rape crucifixion insanity etc the main problem with dr tarr s torture dungeon was the fact that it was a talk a thon more than anything else it was almost like watching a book i just wanted the film to have moments of silence or mood or something instead we see listen to the main characters chit chat endlessly about dull stuff a missed opportunity
distasteful cliched thriller has young couple doing cross country research on america s most infamous murder sites becoming road partners with a dim witted young woman and her snarling boyfriend who is an actual psycho arty and alienating the film s tone alternates between pouty pseudo irony and silly flamboyance handsomely made perhaps but ultimately laughable brad pitt s performance as the low rent killer is godawful from
don t drink the cool aid this is an opinion piece disguised as a documentary and to title it as a truth is just plain crap the debate over global warming is far from over and will only be over when the eco zombies start acknowledging the mountain of evidence contrary to their beloved theory just google global warming and hoax or junk science and you will find a river of information refuting nearly every link in the chain of logic that gore sites the reason it is so important for people to educate themselves is the disastrous economic impact that global warming prevention measures would have wake up people anyone with a computer a little time and some common sense can find many many reasons why this theory is not even close to credible don t just read articles that support your present opinions read everything you can find there is no in depth analysis to make really there is simply too many alternate possibilities and counter evidence for the theory to have even the most basic level of scientific credibility it is so uncredible in fact that it may be the single biggest hoax in the course of human existence it s time for people to start speaking out against this kind of propaganda and it s time for people to admit to themselves and others that you can be a both a conservationist and recognize the glaring conclusion that global warming hysteria is a big lie
as a southern baptist it pains me that i must give a below average rating to an overtly christian movie there certainly aren t so many that i want to discourage film makers from a genre that s woefully under exploited still i must honestly say that love s abiding joy is a typically low budget low key self consciously christian film the plot is predictable the acting mediocre i m being kind and the editing atrocious as a tv movie it might have been slightly above average but as a feature film it leaves much to be desired keep trying guys you ve got to have a movie about about real christians inside you somewhere might i suggest you turn to g k chesterton or c s lewis for some inspiration
it s been said several times not least by me that watching an eric rohmer film is like watching paint dry it seems that monsieur rohmer resents this he doesn t deny it but then how could he he just resents it so much so that his new movie which may also be his last inch allah is set so far back in time that it s like watching woad dry those wonderful people who gave you the nouvelle vague cahiers du cinema have already named it one of the best films of so that should give you some idea reality is not high on rohmer s agenda so that in th century france we have at one extreme a ch teau that would not be out of place in the loire valley whilst the only other dwelling we see is a rude wooden hut the story involves nymphs and shepherds and as he often does rohmer has cast it with unknowns who just happened to be passing so that the overall effect is that the annual class play at a school for special needs pupils was captured on film by accident one is almost tempted to say come back godard all is forgiven but even this woeful production can t make me utter those words
i never like to comment on a good film but when it comes to a bad movie i gotta come really hard on it talking about vivah this guy sooraj badjatya seems to have completely lost it after success of hum aapke hain kaun he thought he can make money with cheesy wedding videos vivah is so so cheesy that badjatyas have left johars and chopras behind there was not a single moment during the movie where i can say oh at least this thing is good aloknath does clich in a role of girl s father shahid kapoor looks fat and shahrukhed amrita rao is another disaster in addition to ugly looking sets bad costumes hackneyed storyline monstrous stepmother trying hard to act actors cacophonous background music cheap soundtracks now the spoiler i m warning you guys that as happens in all his other movies after a calamitous incidence movie ends on a happy note
the zombie chronicles aspect ratio nu view d sound format monowhilst searching for a literal ghost town in the middle of nowhere a young reporter emmy smith picks up a grizzled hitchhiker joseph haggerty who tells her two stories involving flesh eating zombies reputed to haunt the area an absolute waste of time hobbled from the outset by haggerty s painfully amateurish performance in a key role worse still the two stories which make up the bulk of the running time are utterly routine made worse by indifferent performances and lackluster direction by brad sykes previously responsible for the likes of camp blood this isn t a fun movie in the sense that ed wood s movies are fun he at least believed in what he was doing and was sincere in his efforts despite a lack of talent sykes home made movies are in fact aggravating boring and almost completely devoid of any redeeming virtue and most viewers will feel justifiably angry and cheated by such unimaginative badly conceived junk the d format is utterly wasted here
after hearing the word of mouth of just how bad this film is i took the plunge and bought the dvd that said everything previously mentioned about this film is true for a film that claimed to have a budget in the millions it just does not show on the screen at all the list of problems with the film could drag on forever chief amongst them is the film is simply too long it dragged on for a few minutes short of hours nearly an hour probably could have been cut off the run time had the editor simply removed the overabundance of scenes dealing with nothing more then the main character wandering around aimlessly secondly as many had pointed out from the trailers the special effects are anything but special the tripods looked ok in a few shots here and there but beyond that everything was grade z s or s quality probably the worst effects of all were the horses which stiffly tottered back and forth as they moved the heat ray effects were laughable as people were reduced to bones that somehow were still able to flail about without any muscles also pitiful was the thunderchild sequence in which the thunderchild described in the book as an ironclad ram looked nothing of the sort instead it resembled a world war era destroyer complete with deck guns which fired but had no visible crew and torpedo tubes the colors and backgrounds were just as bad as the effects most laughable of all was a scene early on in which the main character and his wife go for a nighttime stroll and he points out mars to her in the sky well the sky is black but the views of the characters and the landscape around them is broad daylight there is also a very sharp demarcation between the real landscape bathed in full sunlight and the fake black night sky with overly large fuzzy stars to detract even further the color of the scenes made no sense in some they are bathed in orange light in others green light in still others it s blue light in some instances the outsides are orange lit but the interiors of houses are green or blue the frame rate and camera is very shaky giving everything a stuttering look finally the acting is overall sub par one man portrays two characters who s sole difference was one lacked a mustache this led to some confusion at times as to who was who and where they all were the english accents even to american ears are outrageous in summary this movie could very well make a claim to being the worst film released in recent times i have not seen gigli or some of the other recent flops but this one because of it s poor quality in every respect must easily be worse then anything that mainstream hollywood has put out i would not be surprised if the movie makes it to the bottom or in the imdb rankings it s a pity that mystery science theater is not still around
its a gem movie if anyone who hasn t seen movie sholey he cant understand what is going on there a thakur call men for catching a big terrorist who is like god and even police don t know abut him but these ppl do biggest advantage of film is its speed u never know what is going on and the part is completed actors are at there best of worst acting and actress is here for time pass of songs and what u cant forget is the cool dialouge which seems to come in very long time but u cant understand them so easily try hard for that and last word i haven t seen movie complete due to a brain roast so plz tell me ditz end if it have
devil hunter gained notoriety for the fact that it s on the dpp video nasty list but it really needn t have been many films on the list where there for god and dpp only known reasons and while this isn t the tamest of the bunch there isn t a lot here that warrants banning which is a shame because i never would have sat through it where it not for the fact that it s on the shopping list the plot actually gives the film a decent base or at least more of a decent base than most cannibal films and it follows an actress who is kidnapped and dragged off into the amazon jungle a hunter is then hired to find her but along the way he has to brave the natives lead by a man who calls himself the devil hence the title the film basically just plods along for eighty five minutes and there really aren t many scenes of interest it s a real shame that jess franco ended up making films like this because the man clearly has talent as seen by films such as the diabolical dr z venus in furs faceless and she kills in ecstasy but unfortunately his good films are just gems amongst heaps of crap and devil hunter is very much a part of the crap i saw this film purely because i want to be able to say i ve seen everything on the dpp s list just two more to go and i m guessing that s why most other people who have seen it saw it but if you re not on the lookout for nasties there really is no reason to bother with this one
i love science fiction i am fascinated by egyptian mythology and i appreciate digital animation i figured a movie that combines these three would be at least enjoyable i could not have been more wrong the story or actually the lack there of was completely uninspired and lacks imagination while imagination usually is the biggest component of any science fiction story the dialogue and acting are even worse than in an average porno movie especially thomas kretschmann gives new meaning to the term bad performance bad acting wouldn t have been such a huge problem if only director bilal didn t take himself so seriously all the lines sound like they are supposed to be poetic it looks like bilal really thinks he has made a piece of art here well there s no art or poetry to be found in this piece of junk only pretentiousness this man should really stick to making comics since he fails on all possible accounts as a director worst of all is the terrible digital animation which is so ugly that it actually turns watching this movie into a physically painful experience the graphics look so fake they even make the werewolves in van helsing look like live actors and since half the characters are cgi animated it is quite a problem that the cgi effects look so fake if the egyptian gods actually exist then bilal s a dead guy since they will no doubt take gruesome revenge on him for the ridiculous way in which he portrays them in this disastrously bad movie
when teenagers go on a trip in a camper van there are many clich s that you can guarantee will follow the teenagers will be warned not to go where they are going by a crazy local dan van husen handles that with ridiculous exposition about deadly sirens what who how and why are handled in one almost unintelligible burst the van will break down whilst looking for help the group will be split up and be picked off one by one by whatever monster they have been warned about they will find a house inhabited by a madman he will capture them the house will have a phone but it will not work it will be disturbingly decorated there will be flickering neon light spiders and maggots the madman will catch them as they try to escape in a vehicle that won t start here the high speed getaway was to be made on a tractor the madman will be seemingly killed only to come back from the dead for a cheap weak scare and will then be killed properly only a girl will be left alive from the group there will be an unnecessary twist at the end add to these elements naked sirens who the characters seem to react to in startling different ways despite the fact that everyone that sees them is supposed to fall into lust with them immediately that seduce and kill the teens throats being ripped out and bodies being pulled in half and you have something resembling a twelve year old boys dream movie i think it is only fair to say that my opinion of the director and his previous work is as low as it is possible to be but i am happy to point out that there are a few elements that boarder on pleasurable and are a great improvement on his previous film darkhunters which is one of the worst films i have ever seen at times the cinematography is very good the music and editing are a cut above his previous films and some other low budget horror movies i was impressed to hear that it was achieved with a third of the money spent on the previous monstrosity however the worst things about this movie are not to be found in the body of the film it is ultimately a mildly diverting if pointless movie that has been done time and time again but amongst the dvd extras if you do rent this film i implore you to listen to the director s commentary it is beyond belief there is more to say about this than the film itself one staggering part of the commentary is the director s claim that the film is clich leaden because it was a preconceived idea he says it is a deliberate attempt to use all of the clich s and openly he wonders if people will get it i m afraid to say that if this is supposed to be a clever nod and a wink to films of the past and the genre clich s within them then it is not wittily scripted enough acted in an appropriate tone nor directed with enough style to work if this film was made to order it leads me to ask one question what was the point this is s afilm that just slips right into the canon of bad horror movies any attempt to do something clever or different haven t worked the next nugget of brilliance is a conversation about the snobbery towards digital film formats they rightly point out that digital is often synonymous with cheapness and ease of use however the best moment of the conversation comes when they bemoan the fact that when michael mann makes a film in the format he is branded as a visionary there is a simple distinction to be made here mann is a talented director who will use the format to fit his story and style roberts is a horror hack who uses it to produce bottom shelf genre pictures i think the differences are obvious and the comparison is not only arrogant but redundant the best moment is reserved for robert s comments about people who have taken the time to review his previous film those who didn t like it are generalised as geeks and he even goes as far as to single out specific people for having the nerve to voice their opinion in forums that encourage them to do just that i must admit i was slightly disappointed that my review of his last film wasn t singled out for ridicule the tirade goes further as the group joke about norwegian reviewers complete with hilarious accents to imply that people from norway wouldn t know a good film simply because of where they are born as always these sorts of comments say more about those saying them than those they are targeting they simply make the director and his friends look ignorant the package in rounded out with a tasteful featurette about how the sirens were cast robert s swears blind in voice over i didn t want to make a film that was like baywatch as we see audition tapes of topless and naked girls writhing around on the ground there is also a simpering self indulgent documentary about the making of darkhunters during which robert s says that a reviewer has claimed that forest is the best british film in years i don t know who he is trying to convince at one point in the commentary track robert s says jokingly i can see people sitting at home saying this isn t amazing its sh t he isn t wrong
this movie gets both a rating from me as well as a here is why as a standard horror movie for the standard horror crowd where action and gore and scares are taken into consideration this movie will bore you it s basically a family drama similar to what you d see on the lifetime channel but put in a horror universe the story and formula are age old retreaded hundreds of times if you re looking for any originality in the plot structure or the minimal conflicts you ll be disappointed take away the zombies and you ll have something just as melodramatic as a beautiful mind tripping on cheese this is the however the basic synopsis and idea is pretty original and over the top it s literally something you and your friends would joke about when you re half drunk but that joke actually got a theatrical release the idea gets a from me the only reason it isn t perfect is because they could have taken it even further but they didn t the mix of both is mixed i thought it was funny but as with most all comedies it wasn t that funny i had my mom and little sister watch it with me and the jokes we made about it were funnier than the jokes scripted there were moments of utter genius but there were also moments of pure boredom i sincerely hope that other movies take this kind of over the top risk and original ideas i just can t say it was perfect or even near it because of the lack of originality to the plot a great family movie a great movie to watch with a bunch of guys or girls a great movie to watch with anyone but if you watch it alone it will be a bit boring other people always make this kind of movie funnier and richer
some not so spoily spoilers aheadwhy do people when they are disoriented or sick or scared at a club cut through the middle of the crowded dance floor on their way to the bathroom who in their right mind would hide under a bed when someone breaks into their room how often do you knock on a stranger s door and when they don t immediately answer you open the door walk in shout a few hello s and then start going through their stuff if you were being pursued by someone you just discovered was a murderer what would you do quietly sneak off and hide under a wooden platform or among metal implements run quietly of course to a ratty old barn or other decrepit structure i could be talking about almost any thriller that s come out in the last few years but since this is the the return page obviously i m talking about the return i saw it free because i work at a movie theater and make a point of screening all the scary movies i thought this one was tolerable aside from the well worn clich s sarah michelle gellar is really drab and looks kind of huh through most of the film the details of the plot are slowly given out as the movie progresses and it s almost enough to make it interesting except there wasn t enough explanation as it moved on and so i was almost lost until the last of it if you re a die hard thriller fan it s worth seeing at least once if there s nothing better at the theater and you really want to watch a movie eh i guess it s worth a matin e ticket if you thought the trailer made it look like an interesting movie and you can t wait wait
i cannot believe that i wasted five hours of my life on this rubbish the previous five day offering by this author was highly enjoyable and i was really looking forward to this but most of the dialogue was completely incomprehensible suranne jones was the principal culprit since she either mumbled or gabbled her lines but most of the rest of the cast followed her example notable exceptions were bernard hill and anne reid old stagers whose diction was exemplary do producers not listen to productions before they are aired to make sure the dialogue is audible as a result i suppose i lost track of what was going on and since the original plot line seemed to metamorphose into to the standard them and us thing between muslims and the rest i soon lost interest the ending was a complete anti climax a complete dud
okay look i ve seen lots and i do mean lots of these types of films you know the ones where the dvd cover just look so good and scaarrryyy that you just cant wait to see it well i got got again and i m getting pretty tired of it but i digress it s pretty simple it sucked i know rather juvenile but it did andi so agree with the other poster that if we had to sit through the boring thing why oh why did the lead actress have to be so unnattractive distractingly so if i may add and the scowl she used convey unresolved pain grief over the death of her daughter did little help i mean jesus oh but the crawling on her back demon thingee was pretty neat
apparently most viewer knows nothing about the history of europe including germany hungary and the whole central and eastern europe as well as the hitler and stalin era nuremberg and a lot of forgotten trials all over europe was a revenge and injustice of the winners what do you think why were not any american british french or soviet defendants after the wwii there were no american british etc war crimes there were no hiroshima no nagasaki no tokyo no dresden no hamburg no berlin no katyn and so on the germans had war crimes too but in nuremberg the justice was not a real consideration the main point was vae victis germany must perish that was also a book title in america this film is an awful ignoble american brainwashing instrument full of error lie propaganda prejudice and injustice and first of all full of hypocrisy but not surprisingly why wasn t enough the nuremberg process itself this film is a nightmare total darkness after years this darkness and hate and narcissism and lack of self criticism is the real cause of the massacres in korea vietnam cambodia serbia iraq and so forth and there are no american war criminals bravo america very clever even stalin would become envious of it
a propaganda film for the palestinian cause if you were expecting an unbiased documentary on the israeli palestinian conflict you will need to look elsewhere if you are an anti semite or merely an anti zionist nothing wrong with advocating the destruction of a country right or uncritically in support of palestinian goals e g mass murder the destruction of israel this is the documentary for you should make for an entertaining evening on college campuses around the uk and us however any informed and intellectually honest person would be outraged at the sheer number of lies presented in this video i just hope those who truly are unaware of the situation aren t corrupted by this anti semitic filth
once again disney manages to make a children s movie which totally ignores its background about the only thing common with this and the original gadget cartoons is the names the most glaring errors are the characters penny does not have her book brain has been reduced from a character to a fancy prop dr claw is more a show off than an evil villain etc but there are more than that the horrors start from the first minutes of the film having gadget as a security guard called john brown doesn t help identifying him as the classic inspector gadget and right in the beginning we see disney s blatant attempt to turn every story ever into a love affair between a man and a woman they introduce brenda who only serves to make this movie disney compatible add to this the fact that the claw seen in this film and the classic dr claw are almost diagonally opposite and you ll see this is going to be nowhere near the original storyline what would help would be a better storyline to replace it but as you guessed disney failed in that too the whole movie is just gadget acting silly for silliness s sake and lusting after brenda as if to add insult to the injury disney introduced the new gadgetmobile it doesn t look function or think like the old gadgetmobile at all it s just the canonical comic relief figure disney obviously recognised that the gadget cartoons were a comedy so they made the film a comedy too but they took out all the clever running gags like the assignment paper exploding in the chief s face and replaced them with gadget being a moron the gadgetmobile being a wise ass and claw showing off someone should tell disney that children s movie doesn t imply total lack of any brain usage gadget should be targeted for children of years not children of months like this movie whatever this movie is supposed to be it is not repeat not the real inspector gadget because i love the old gadget i hate this
i think that can sum up this show about as well as anything batman tas may be the worst thing to ever happen to cartoons based on comic books because everything that comes after will be compared to it and nothing has measured up yet it s just too damn good was batman beyond good yeah but it was no tas is justice league good it s not too bad but it s no tas the batman is certainly no tas either but i won t hold that against it it would be unfair and besides it has plenty of other problems with it the concept of a younger less experienced batman fighting crime is a fine one and at times the art is very nice but all of the rest of the time the art is worthless americanime and this betrays a lot of the flaws of the show itself it is paced written and designed like an americanime if i wanted to watch jackie chan adventures i d watch jackie chan adventures or i could just bang my head into a wall any time and get the same effect the joker is a homicidal mentally unstable clown in a suit who uses his wits unpredictability and clever gadgets to fight batman when he is forced to fight hand to hand he will either resort to something cheap or be totally outmatched he is not meant to be a monkey with dreadlocks who knows kung fu and can leap into twenty feet into the air accompanied by speed lines if they had wanted to do that with a villain there were other less important characters they could have used or gasp they could have created a new one entirely and it s not that re imaginings are a bad thing don t get me wrong tas there i go again took mr freeze from your standard icegun wielding b villain and made him into a memorable and morally complex character of course freeze wasn t exactly a classic villain at the time and they performed an upgrade but the point stands what the batman does is it takes everything you liked about batman comics and lore and takes a large smelly dump on them guess what they were eating corn it s obvious this show can t stand against tas but stand it on its own legs and it still doesn t work for me the plots aren t good and they don t develop any better they ve been written for the demographic of children under twelve should children be able to enjoy a show of course they should this shouldn t be an adult show with swearing nudity and gratuitous violence but the mark of a truly good show is that it can be enjoyed on different levels by all ages this show misses that mark is this show a tas no of course not the problem is it s not even a jlu
yeti curse of the snow demon starts aboard a plane full of american high school teens who are on their way to play a football game in japan unfortunately during a fierce thunder storm their plane crashes in the himalayas unlucky really with some dead some alive the survivors have to think about themselves decide to wait it out until help comes however just when they think their luck couldn t get any worse they soon discover that a huge hairy yeti type abominable snowman creature wants to kill eat them all trapped cold starving fighting for survival will help reach the stranded teens in time yeah with a title like yeti curse of the snow demon it can only mean one thing that is that someone at the sci fi channel has made yet another creature feature although to give these things a bit of variety the sci fi channel here in the uk are now dubbing them as a beast feast as if that will make any difference directed by paul ziller one has to say that yeti curse of the snow deamon is a terrible film but a somewhat entertaining one at the same time sure it s bad but it s sort of fun at times too the basic premise is alright actually it s a sort of cross between alive with it s plane crash the survivors having to turn cannibal to survive the excellent gory killer bigfoot another legendary hairy monster exploitation flick night of the demon which i would defend with my last breath i have to say it s not exactly a marriage made in heaven but as i said it s fun at times if not exactly gripping or well written the character s are mostly annoying american teens there s the expected arguing there s the macho hero the strong female the coward who thinks only of himself so there s no prizes for originality there are some plot holes too if a plane load of people crash why only send two rangers on foot to search for them how are you going to dig a large hole line it with sharpened sticks in the space of ten minutes why did the yeti not kill that bird at the end it had killed everyone else up to that point so why not her the there are actually two yeti s running around twist isn t used to any effect at all either at least there s a good pace about the film it certainly moves along at a fair old pace i never found myself becoming bored with it there s some moderately gory action the film does have some fascination in seeing whether the kids are going to survive or not if they are going to eat their dead mates or not the one thing you can always say about these sci fi channel creature features or beast feasts is that the cgi computer effects will be laugh out loud hilarious so that proves to be the case yet again the plane crash at the start looks awful the yeti when it s cgi looks simply embarrassing jumping all over the place like it s on a pogo stick there one or two nice gore scenes including a ripped off arm a squashed head a ripped out heart some dead bodies some blood splatter the best bit when the yeti rips a guy in half beats him with his own ripped off legs before biting a big chunk out of them according to the imdb the actor playing the yeti took three a half hours to get into the suit the make up which seems like a long time since it s actually a pretty tatty looking creation apparently the original title was raksha curse of the snow demon with raksha meaning demon in tibetan sanskrit so now you know this has reasonable production values considering the usual sci fi channel stuff they churn out although the mountain location looks nothing like the harsh bleak himalayas was probably situated near some ski resort somewhere during a lot of the daytime scenes it actually looks pleasantly warm the acting isn t that good i didn t think any of the girls looked that good either which didn t help yeti curse of the snow demon is another terrible sc fi channel creature feature if i am honest that any sane person will not like but if your looking for a bit of horror themed fun then this isn t too bad there are one or two entertaining moments that make it somewhat watchable even if it s not very good
already his first claim that desires are always artificial is totally fallacious when a jehovah witness reject gets his own documentary on movies or anything for that matter it s time for anyone to get their own although far far more intelligent than say paris hilton i know not too difficult zizek s mouth spews just as much baloney as hers just a different kind he combines the worst from both his professional worlds psychoanalysis and philosophy both fields are notorious for conveniently offering the expert b lls osopher plenty of leeway to create unprovable theories to rant without a beginning or end and to connect concepts almost randomly in the process misusing the english language by creating a semantic jumble only a mother can love example there are three main marx brothers hence what a great idea to connect them with three levels of human consciousness the id the ego and the super ego i m kind of surprised he didn t play a clip from snowhite and make an analogy between the seven dwarfs and the seven levels of gahannah moslem hell it s like the premise of schumacher s the number play with numbers long enough and you can come up with any kind of cockamamie theory you want even linking ancient greeks with princess di s death however there is an entertainment element to tpgtc watching a raving lunatic sweat like a hog while uttering delusional chants masked as intellectual analysis can be quite a lot of fun why watch cuckoo s nest or any other madhouse drama when you can have zizek for more than hours it s like watching an amusing train wreck admittedly he is almost funny on one or two occasions i have always been mystified by people who desperately try to elevate movie making into an exalted intellectual social science giving idiotic movies like birds this much thought hence this much credit probably has its fat creator laughing in his grave the raw truth is that the vast majority of movies have zero intellectual value and the few ones that do have some intelligence don t require a shrink turned philosopher to draw one a map to understand them unless one is a complete idiot zizek sees layers and layers of meaning in the most banal movies hallucinogenic drugs must be rather popular and cheap in slovenia these days when zizek showed the bathtub hole in the psycho shower scene i thought he was going to say something about galactic black holes how they drain the life out of stars just as the bathtub hole sucks in janet leigh s blood or perhaps he could have said how the hole represents leigh s vagina with the blood flowing into it instead of out as in menstruation this representing some kind of clever zizekian irony speaking of which the real irony is that if hitchcock had really put that much thought into every scene and the script his movies wouldn t have been the illogical far fetched crap that they often are the point of these bathtub hole analogies was to show just how easy it is to improvise about hidden deep meanings and when you add zizek s fanciful terminology from philosophy and psychology layering these terms on top of these analogies like wedding cake decorations you get a rambling jumble that can instantly impress the uneducated i e the easily impressionable and the gullible zizek utters a number of unintentionally funny things here one of the most absurd ideas being when he associates anthony perkins s cleaning of the bloodied bathroom with the satisfaction of work of a job well done don t laugh neither hitchcock nor the writer of psycho could have ever even vaguely entertained this notion that perkins might be enjoying a job well done the cleaning of a blood stained toilet while they were conceiving directing that scene talk about putting words into one s dead mouth but in the context of misinterpreting what the director had to say i like zizek s initial thoughts on tarkovsky s terrific solaris but then he has to ruin a rare good impression by dragging in anti feminism and other nonsense into his theory zizek s attitude towards logic is that of a dog toward its plastic bone i just want to play with it all day logic has its rules and is not supposed to be raped at least not publicly by the likes of him he seems to regard logic proof common sense and reason as enemies or mere throwaway toys concepts to be either avoided twisted to fit the end goal or simply annihilated zizek is the lsd tripped hippie and all his favorite movies are his own personal s the fact that zizek over focuses on two of the most overrated directors and ones whose films often lack intelligence if anything such as hitchcock and lynch only further diminishes his already low credibility i was surprised de palma didn t feature more prominently that s another lame director who writes inept scripts zizek has a field day with lynch s incomprehensible lost highway there are just as many interpretations of that movie as there are people who watched it zizek s comment that the viewer readily accepts von trier s laughable ground breaking physical set up in dogville made me snicker however zizek doesn t only make up stuff as he goes along he also indulges heavily in the bleedin obvious like all social scientists an oxymoron he wraps his very trite observations into articulate if full of spitting and sometimes complex blankets of language after all sociology functions in precisely the same way it makes us believe we are hearing something new when in fact it s what we already all know but told in an eloquent way which fools the more unobservant listener i was half expecting for men in white suits to suddenly appear out of nowhere and strap him up in a loonie suit slavoj zizek soon as a stalker in a kid s park near you http rateyourmusic com list fedor worst cases of nepotism
i wasn t expecting this to be a great movie but neither was i expecting it to be so awful i hated the mother character so much i had to turn the channel i turned it back hoping it was just one part of the movie but no and for the daughter to sit there take being embarrassed or almost done out of a job or driven to madness inside her own home are you kidding me i was raised to respect and even fear my mother but i d put her up fast in the nearest hotel if she proved that annoying in my house i was expected to follow a set of rules in my mother s house after all i didn t buy any of it i tried giving it several chances i really did sorry
first of all write the script on a napkin who needs more than that after all we re not a hollywood film then get amateur actors it will be good for the festival hype after all who needs people who have spent years honing their craft then hire a cinematographer who doesn t know how to light you see if it s well lit it won t look real and the festival people won t like it who needs to have professional level photography anyway then hire a ten year old who has never held a camera to be your operator it will give your movie that completely amateurish touch that festival screeners will mistake for reality and guarantee that even though you will empty the seats from real people critics and a small sliver of the audience who over intellectualize will scream genius because they won t believe this was just complete amateur hour once you ve done that buy your ticket to the festival of bad movies aka sundance what a sad waste
i will probably always go to see a woody alleb movie as one never knows when he just might make a real return to his past greatness just one or two great moments or lines could make it worthwhile sadly however this film just does nt make it on any score saying thar actually makes me sad and even a little guilty i m sure my reaction is much like a lot of other fans of woody but what can one say it s probably time for him to concentrate on his clarinett which in my opinion he is rather quite good saying all of this i ll still probably go to any new film woody may come out with in the future there s always hope and i ll continue to love and respect the woody
this show is not clever that s basically what it boils down to the original humor that these writers try to pull off to avoid completely biting off the rest of the worlds bush bashing is just unfunny in another comment someone quotes a couple hilarious lines the standout for me was george h w bush telling the kids they re not supposed to watch any tv besides fox news wow i thought the episodes i saw were bad the fact that this line is a high point for the series is pathetic my problem with drivel like this sad excuse for political satire is that these folks are getting a second season i m a liberal republican and i know bush hasn t been a good president we all do but that s no excuse for putting out this utterly poopie waste of time i place these writers on the same level as the geniuses behind meet the spartans their formula bite off as many already unfunny topical jokes as you can and throw in even worse original material to actually be able to give yourself writing credit again just plain bad unfunny and it just makes me more and more unhappy that crap like this is renewed but amazing and original shows like arrested development are canned after solid seasons please don t watch this crap unless you re one of those green blooded liberal hippies who think any sentence with the words bush and dumb is comedic gold oh and the voice of bush sucks all he does is slightly emulate a texan accent and exhale really hard at the end of his sentences at least south park admits the voices aren t accurate if you want funny political satire watch daily show colbert or look for any political sketches on robot chicken which is fun to watch since the stop motion action figure animation is extremely well done look for the george bush as a jedi bit on youtube priceless
this is the kind of film one watches in gape jawed horrified silence and yet continues to watch mesmerized as if watching a train wreck in slow motion and yet in the back of your mind thoughts are churning who on earth green lighted this garbage some of the preceding user comments say things like a good way to introduce children to laurel and hardy an insult to children everywhere that children would need some sort of training plan to learn to love slapstick comedy shows a profound misunderstanding of the nature of children the world over others have commented on the faithfulness of the two stars characterizations of laurel and hardy to which i would respond so what one would think that the rash of movie bombs based on beloved series rocky and bullwinkle avengers flipper mod squad ad nauseam would have taught hollywood that there are some things that simply can t be recreated the films of laurel and hardy are readily available on video why bother with this as for f murray abraham a fine actor of stage and screen well all i can say is he must have been in trouble with the irs run don t walk away from the television if this trash comes on
ohhh the brutality ohhhhh the dying breed ohhhh the sense of loss ohhhh the prejudice jeez when are all you whiney revisionists going to stop analyzing westerns for crying out loud s t happens if it offends your socially engineered sensibilities then go back to the comfort of your meryl steep collection boring tedious and very tiresome waste of celluloid particularly in light of coburn hackman bergen s presence nothing interesting or intriguing here unless you are obsessed with th century desert dentisty may have been a little better without the constant diversion of the out of place mexican guy with the bad tooth a monument to the stupid ultra left creeping sensitivity of the s virtually impossible to sit through the entire film i think i d rather have my eyes stapled open for the entire lucky luke trinity series horses all deader n hell
this is far worse than those awful laurel and hardy cartoons of the s they were terrible but at least they were simple ripoffs of a then stan and ollie resurgence new audiences had rediscovered the pair s comedic genius and the cartoons were mind numbing garbage geared to cash in on children s interest it was to be expected but how does one even attempt to rationalize this work of i can t even think of a word i m sure the makers hoped it would somehow inspire another laurel and hardy revival but you can t inspire interest in the past with a shallow and unfunny caricature of what made the original so appealing the impressionists i hesitate to call them actors do a vegas act and that s where it belongs the plot is even flimsier than those used in the old days trying to stretch out two reel ideas for a feature if this film was someone s first exposure to the real laurel and hardy i m sure that viewer would dismiss the original duo s reputation as senility gone amok the only movie i hate worse than this is i spit on your grave and you know these filmmmakers basically did the same thing to stan and ollie
i happened upon this flick on a rainy sunday intending to tune in to something else out of curiosity i accessed the comments here and found myself watching it to the end i really didn t do so with intent this was one of those movies where you re fascinated and watch it for another couple of minutes until you finally just watch to the end and the indictment of it in most of these comments made it more fascinating to view the one comment where the person really liked it seems to be solely as a result of liking ladd and spano and their earlier roles but great isn t anywhere to be found anywhere here story performances and particularly the absurd courtroom hi jinks we all know that perry mason before raymond burr passed the lb mark and ben matlock are granted some leeway in cavorting around the courtroom instead of being boringly confined to a lectern and matlock is especially granted the privilege of entering exhibits often by simply going to the jury and showing them before the judge and prosecutor have even been informed of or shown them no real life judge or prosecutor would stand for this both perry and ben almost always ended the proceedings by wringing a confession of the real killer actually perry nearly always did this but often matlock would simply present overwhelming evidence of the true culprit pronounce it reasonable doubt and then leave it to the cops and prosecutors to proceed against the guilty party sometimes on camera sometimes presumed at the end of the show but that said holland taylor s histrionics and the amount of leeway afforded her in the courtroom portion of this story made the actions of matlock mason more closely resemble the slow often boring detail such as seen on court tv and in real life courtrooms every character in this presentation was either insipid unsympathetic obnoxious boring improbable or some combination of two or more of these the ending was the most banal absurd even silly conclusion possible but again fascinating because of this ladd and spano are attractive individuals and t v movies would appear their best forte probably best in nd lead probably better if rd roles even in this venue taylor could be cast as the aunt or mother of one of them give this one star for the story performances and additional for the fascination factor
this is easily one of the worst martial arts films i ve ever seen and that s saying something the chant of viva chiba viva chiba is heard at the title soon you will be chanting to yourself stupid stupid the basic story is that the mafia is running drugs into japan and one man vowels to stop them of course that s our man sonny chiba the karate master offers up his service to anyone who can provide information on the drug lords a woman comes forward and he becomes the bodyguard but what are her true intentions let me say at this point who cares soon we are treated to or tortured by a series of poorly choreographed fights and a lame storyline that becomes more and more laughable at every moment sonny eventually wipes out the bad guys with his karate skills end of story oh yeah the woman was corrupt too congratulations you may have just watched the funniest film ever as stated already this is one of the worst martial arts films i have ever seen what makes it semi watchable is to see how badly made a film can be some have already mentioned the infamous american intro put into the film that s probably the most entertaining part of the film and it s beyond funny i would agree its worth watching just to see how lame the s karate scene was at the time watch as aaron banks leaves a guy hanging by his nuts then flips a fat student bad editing punching him in the throat but everything is badly done in this film terrible unbelievable fights fake i mean fake blood bad acting dubbing wardrobe and let s not forget the story one man to take out an entire drug problem in a country i bet fight after fight is laughable this was the s when people still believed karate was effective in a fight but chiba brings it to new levels with some of the nonsense put out in this movie let s see he kicks a gun in half kicks a guy so hard what looks like his dentures fall out and of course chopping the bottle scene give me a break not to mention the fact that it s very hard to tell what happens in the fights because it s filmed so poorly one part that was amusing was when he broke the guys arm through the door giving him a compound fracture ok as the action goes on we are treated to gobs of blood really fake blood too say it looked poorly made is and understatement the acting is totally non existent in this film i don t expect much from a film of this caliber anyway as long as the action is good but it wasn t and as expected the dubbing is extremely poor was it my imagination or did they dub the asian go go dancer with a black accent as expected from a s wardrobe you ll be in stitches laughing at some of the trends and nasty women put forth for the gratuitous nudity that comes with these flicks also why would the mafia be so obvious and all where black trench coats and hats all the time don t try and hide it now the characters were stupid as well the pimp club owner s one of whom is decked out in a japanese pimp suit and the other who has a taste for bores head looks like fat hippie also one last thing that bothered me throughout the film was the awful music with some woman whaling it was very annoying overall this is a terrible film by both martial arts standards and good movie making that doesn t mean that it s not entertaining with a film made so poorly it s hard not to laugh through most of this film if you can stomach it this was an old favorite watch with my best friend if it was purely bad i would give one star but the laughs it delivers bumps it up out
spoiler alert in this generic and forgettable action movie lorenzo lamas does his usual tough guy pretty boy act and his future real life ex kathleen kinmont is ass kicking hot chick alexa oj simpson is a detective coasting by on his since vanished genial public persona translation cable tv filler there isn t enough skin to qualify this as a guilty pleasure the script has some gaping holes best worst moment in one jarring scene oj s partner expresses his aversion to the morgue oj responds that some of the bodies are pretty hot or words to that effect this vague necrophilia reference is offensive enough but in light of the murders committed shortly after this movie was released it is truly appalling and therefore entertaining in an unintentional horrible way i was so startled that i laughed until champagne came out of my nose now that s a guilty pleasure bc
i just finished watching this movie it wasn t ridiculously bad but i m really disappointed with it i m not really sure why someone would make a movie like this it was marginally entertaining but i feel like the people making it had a lot of disagreements on what they were making monday the writer was in charge tuesday the director wednesday the guy who gets the coffee etc it almost seems like they really wanted to make a couple different movies but only had the time and money to make one someone else commented that the acting was really good but i d have to disagree then again if the actors were able to keep a straight face during the filming perhaps they re better actors than i give them credit for the back of the dvd gives the impression that the movie would be a mystery something along the lines of a historical law and order or national treasure it starts off like that but then out of nowhere it takes a turn towards a bad episode of the twilight zone or what was that other show that wasn t as good a bad episode of the outer limits my main complaint about the movie is that it is just so played out there s the evil guy with spiked white hair there s the love interest who when she first appears the wind actually blows through her hair seriously once you realize it s a christian movie the end is also pretty easy to spot the cinematography was poorly done especially in the opening scenes way to put your best foot forward it wasn t atrocious for most of the movie but there was the occasional ridiculously bad shot of an old lady praying arms up in a dark room while lightening is striking the sort of thing that just makes you a little bit embarrassed to be watching the movie
in i liked it then it became very stupid it suggests that kids are brainless it insults children cartoon network used to be great one of the shows i liked was hamtaro it did manage to be interesting and imaginative in its approach to children programming the show foster s home for imaginary friends is like putting spoons of sugar in your sprite it seems as if today s television producers are only interested in making money rather than engaging the imaginations of children and making money lately my children are tuning in to the old shows s to find something interesting to watch perhaps in the absence of originality for television to look to its past and recycle children s programing from days gone by
well tremors i the original started off in and i found the movie quite enjoyable to watch however they proceeded to make tremors ii and iii trust me those movies started going downhill right after they finished the first one i mean ass blasters now only god himself is capable of answering the question why in gods name would they create another one of these dumpster dives of a movie tremors iv cannot be considered a bad movie in fact it cannot be even considered an epitome of a bad movie for it lives up to more than that as i attempted to sit though it i noticed that my eyes started to bleed and i hoped profusely that the little girl from the ring would crawl through the tv and kill me did they really think that dressing the people who had stared in the other movies up as though they we re from the wild west would make the movie with the exact same occurrences any better honestly i would never suggest buying this movie i mean there are cheaper ways to find things that burn well
hearing such praise about this play i decided to watch it when i stumbled across it on cable i don t see how this elivates women and their struggles by focusing on the topic at hand i guess if you have an interest in stories about women s private parts and how it affects their lives then this is for you otherwise it s rather dull and boring if anything i found it a bit degrading i inquired with a female friend who also watched this and she thought it was horrible as well so it s not just a guy not getting it
i did watch all of the film through to the disgraceful ending even though i felt so angry at what i saw i felt that the director was screaming for attention and the only way he could achieve this was to be as repulsive as possible since i have lived in the uk i have come to love this country but this film depicts british young people in the worst way imaginable there is nothing to be said but avoid it it will make you angry and sick the people involved should be ashamed
this movie was portrayed in the trailer as a comedy it is an extreme tragedy it left me sick to my stomach i hated it i think if they want to make a movie like this than they should be man enough to reflect the true intentions of the movie in the trailer i would not have seen this movie if i would have known i think the trailer should reflect the theme and intentions of a movie i am tired of it i really wanted to have a fun comedy and i am extremely disappointed it has been several days now and i still have a bad taste in my mouth from this movie i have never been more disappointed in a movie nor have i ever written a comment on a bad movie i really think that true deception was involved in this trailer because if they showed the true intention of the movie no one would have seen it
and not in a fun to watch way it s just bad it s shocking that people have posted positive things about it here the story sucks the acting is bad it s not scary the special effects aren t special oh no the blackboard has hands coming out of it oh gee the mirror turned into water the hair clothes and makeup in the s scenes aren t accurate and they got a middle aged man with a receding hairline to play the high school version of himself this is like later on nightmare on elm street stuff i enjoy sitting down to watch a cheesy horror movie as much as anyone else but there are better bad ones out there to choose from
this movie has many problem associated with it that makes it come off like a low budget class project from someone in film school i have to give it credit on its campiness though many times throughout the movie i found myself laughing hysterically it was so bad at times that it was comical which made it a fun watch if you re looking for a low grade slasher movie with a twist of psychological horror and a dash of campy ridiculousness then pop a bowl of popcorn invite some friends over and have some fun i agree with other comments that the sound is very bad dialog is next to impossible to follow much of the time and the soundtrack is kind of just there
it s pretty bad when the generic movie synopsis has more information than the film itself the paragraph long plot summary written on the movie page has details i could not glean from watching the actual movie i found myself constantly backing it up to see what details i had just missed which could tell me what the bleep was going on alas to no avail this movie leaves out monstrous pieces of the story if you could call it a story it s like they were trying to fool us into thinking that there was some kind of movie here filming just enough so that there was the resemblance of a story and leaving the rest to our imaginations newsflash to the the creators i paid to watch you make a movie i can sit home and imagine plots and story lines for free and rosario dawson this is somebody i ve never paid enough attention to to be able to put the name to the face and i can see why she had one of the most artificial performances i have ever seen for a leading character in any movie a or b i figured okay maybe she didn t really want the role just got a hefty offer for a movie she wasn t into wrong she was listed as one of the producers next time you produce something don t book yourself as the lead if you can t act if you really can then create a decent character for you to become also somebody here mentioned the white latino issue yes i hate to say it but this movie does come across as an act of vengeance against white college age males who wear baseball hats that s what happens when there is nothing in the movie to endear the watcher to latino characters the adrian character seems like a cocky jerk who is no better than the story s antagonist as for the maya character she didn t seem like a real person anyway i m ashamed for hollywood that this movie was even made
bobby is a goofy kid who smiles far too much and wants sex so he buys a van to aid in this quest the acting is lame the comedy is pathetic and the script is no more than a loosely strung chain of clich s and cheap thrills the makers of the film obviously wanted to capture some of the out there craziness of other films of the time but fell a long way short they even resort to bobby slipping on a banana skin because this will supposedly add comedic value i m struggling to find a redeeming feature of the film if you like devito this is another classic devito kind of role but he s only a supporting actor and there for clich value
i ve read reviews that apparently you have to have been a student in a very strict british school in the s to understand this maybe that s true if so then this movie is outdated spoiler alert the ending makes about as much sense as all the kids who re anti government and anti corporation without having any better solution that doesn t torch society to a mad max type cinder yeah the main characters could leave but they don t the reasons they go about this don t make sense there isn t enough character development to explain why what shooting up a bunch of innocent people is supposed to mean is never explained or even hinted at it is mentioned that war is the final creative expression quite possibly the only revelation that any characters of this movie have and it makes no sense the characters who go on a murder spree aren t fighting the institution they re just killing people i thought they might ve used all the explosives to blow up the place or at least the sanctuary at the end that would ve made greater symbolic sense but they didn t tl dr this movie is an adolescent s daydream of fighting against authority that plagues them though in reality they need it has no moral symbolic truth or meaning to it this movie simply plays out the fantasy of killing teachers and people in power that annoy you if you think a murder rampage school shooting similar to columbine or virginia tech is a rational and sensible way to deal with teachers and institutions you don t like then i guess you ll love this movie if you re like me and you re working towards making a life for yourself instead of just blindly very blindly in this movie rebelling against the man this movie is juvenile and boring you can also tell in parts that funding was lacking and the story seemed to have a touch of attention deficit disorder all in all this seems like a very rough draft of what could ve been an okay movie but no effort is put into the dialogue character development or moral so it s just poorly done if only i could get my two hours back
i was required to watch the movie for my work so i didn t pay for it on the contrary i got paid but i still found the movie to suck far more than average the jokes were lame the two lead actresses well to use the first wives club division of women s ages in hollywood they are no longer in their hot chick age but more in their district attorney age what angered me most about the movie was the main plot line which pretty much completely plagiarized beavis butthead do america in which the boys are all jazzed up about some dude offering them money to do his wife not realizing they re expected to assassinate her all in all a bland piece of crap
look i loved the proper anchorman film but this was reaaaaallly bad the kind of bad that makes you wish you could get that time back in your life the kind of bad that makes you think what on earth were they thinking to film this in the first place the kind of bad that makes you wish you d taken more minutes when stepping into the kitchen to grab a snack during the film the kind of bad that makes leprosy look fun the kind of bad that makes you think you wish you rented a pauly shore film instead seriously i cannot explain how very bad this was having said that there were some semi amusing laughs but they are all so much less funny than anchorman sure they tried to make it entertaining and fun but the entire subplot that was left out of anchorman that made it here was genuinely left out for a good reason it wasn t even a little bit good do yourself a favour or in the usa a favor and don t watch this dvd it will tarnish the good movie that anchorman is and you don t want to do that okay i m alright now
three story lines and not enough tying them together inside man was very jumpy and an incomplete attempt to be artistic and realistic though having its moments the movie started off looking like a fast thriller which quickly grounded to a slow crawl jumped quickly between highs and lows and only barely picked up steam again near the last minutes i will give credit to denzel washington he played his part extremely well with a full grasp of his human side and not just the typical super detective with all the answers clive owen also did quite well with his duality part as evil genius and criminal mastermind both not the same in retrospect overall though each person individually created a great sub section yet when the parts finally came together and everything counted there was no sudden ah ha or summation of everything it all ended up with very little of the energy it began with with a lot of plot holes tons of questions and as i said earlier no where near spike lee s normal level i have to completely disagree with the so called professional critics this is not the movie they play it up to be
oh dear while chevy chase and the gang at snl set new highs with the sketch show format this fails miserably at every level fortunately chevy is barely in this at all and can t be blamed for this utter tripe it seriously is very very bad while meant to be a political comment on usa at the time of it s release it still remains neither funny or acutely observed the sketches are all way too long and any satirical impact they may have had is lost as they re all drawn out to the point of complete boredom this is credited as chevy s movie debut and i m pleased to say that everything he did after this bettered it avoid even if curious
what happened what we have here is basically a solid and plausible premise and with a decent and talented cast but somewhere the movie loses it actually it never really got going there was a little excitement when we find out that angie is not really pregnant then find out that she is after all but that was it steve martin who is a very talented person and usually brings a lot to a movie was dreadful and his entire character was not even close to being important to this movie other than to make it longer i really would have liked to see more interactions between the main characters kate and angie and maybe try not for a pure comedy which unfortunately it was not but maybe a drama with comedic elements i think if the movie did this it could have been very funny since both actresses are quite funny in their own ways and sitting here i can think of numerous scenarios that would have been a riot
i m going to write about this movie and about irreversible the in famous scene in it so you are warned if you haven t seen the movie yet this are just my thoughts why i think the movie fails in the end pun intended acting wise rosario dawson is really good and almost conveys portraying someone almost a decade younger a teenager in other words the villain guy is good but loses his evil touch right before the end if he really never changes then why would he let a woman tie him up he wouldn t period then we also have the bartender nd rape dude actually i don t think you would need him at least not for the nd rape but more about that later on let s reprise the story rosarios character is sexually insecure might even have lesbian tendencies see her scene with a female friend this wasn t intentional as rosario states herself but there is sexual tension between them rosario s character meets a guy who is a sexual predator in all the bad senses but he makes an impression on her rosario commented that her character had a boyfriend before i beg to differ because she acts as if it is her first boyfriend which also underlines her phone conversation with her mother talking about her mother here s another problem after the first rape takes place rosarios character doesn t tell anyone what happened seiing that her relationship with her mother is a very close one nothing of that gets explored after that if rosarios character wouldn t call her mother anymore or would behave strangely the mother would be worried like crazy there was so much potential here also her female friend we see her at the party it s obvious there is something going on and boom she is gone the first rape is almost unbearable to watch but feels like a pinch when you compare it to the ending rape which feels like you re getting hit with a sledge hammer after rape no we get too stretched out scenes threads are opened such as her construction work is an indication that she might be lesbian as one guy states who tried to hit on her but left in the open no real social contact is established if you leave the bartender guy out who is involved in the nd and last rape scene it s apparent that he isn t a nice guy and his character get s fleshed out a bit but when rosarios character meets her rapist in class again his being in the movie seems pointless we get the point that rosarios character isn t the same anymore that she went bad and is able to hurt people too many scenes show exactly that her being without emotion just doing drugs and other stuff back to rapist who cheats on a test gets caught by rosarios character and they decide to hang out together again really as absurd as that sounds the guy meets up with her not without us having seen him beforehand with another girl very likely that he raped her too although we never see anything of that fortunately and his football career well career is a stretch and he is bullied this is an attempt to give his character some depth and it almost works but then again is too clich to stay with you so rapist submits to rosarios character why exactly because he promised her it was her day again really a guy like that never loses control especially with a woman he raped before i guess this is supposed to show us how stupid he is the bartender guy would have worked as someone who could have hit him over the head or something but letting him submit like that just feels wrong another possibility would have a drug in his drink so rapist undresses and get s blindfolded and let s rosarios character tie him on a bed seriously that s just crazy but what comes next is even crazier first she talks to him then she shuts him up and forces an object into him this is as difficult to watch as rape scene number one this isn t about what this guy deserves or not it s just intense and of course that was what they were aiming for now after she is done the bartender guy comes in and rapes rapist if this really should work as a revenge movie it would have been better if rosarios character herself would have been doing all the revenge having a henchman doing the job takes away everything that was built up this isn t supposed to be entertaining enjoyable it s a hard watch it is art house but the minute i didn t count rape scene at the end just smashes everything rosarios character is more or less only watching what happens which brings me to the biggest disappointment irreversible comparison irreversible had the rape scene but the movie went on even if it was back into time rosario is looking into the camera in the end and says something about having to get over this first that comes a bit too late that should see her say that after the initial rape and secondly and most importantly this is where the art house movie should ve come in it is more interesting seeing were rosarios character would go after the second rape scene and how she would cope with what she had done but then again she didn t actually physically do that much see above a broken character that the movie cuts off good intentions talia and rosario had worked before but failing to convey most of the things they set out to do even if you can see what they meant it has to be convincing otherwise it doesn t work not to mention the overlong rape scenes as they are
this is not a boring movie the audience might stay on its chair fascinated by this selfish character miles berkowitz both film maker and actor here the storyline is simple after a divorce and ten years of a hollywoodian non career the author plays is quest for love in front of the camera the first question is about how true is all that what is written what came by chance both answers yes or no portrays m berkowitz as a low average human beeing if you look for a self fiction about love like this one i recommand you to read some independant comic books chester brown joe matt beside of this i felt quite disappointed to hear so much against my country france i know american people usually say that the french are arrogant that might be true then etc and for sure the french and the whole world have lots of griefs against america but why so much hate don t think i couldn t like this movie only because of that anyhow
first off i d like to say that if i had to honestly rate this movie from a to a then i d give it a it s not that i m a tough critic it s just that this movie is that bad everything from the story to the directing to the editing is awful the story is not even halfway decent to begin with you can t expect much since it is based on a video game something i was not aware of going into the movie but the directing and editing made it even worse the movie cuts at awkward points and goes to scenes that are completely unrelated to the previous ones some like a quick sex scene in the middle don t even make sense being put into the story seeing as how the characters don t show any feelings toward each other you could go into this movie expecting to see a pile of crap on the screen for an hour and a half and you d still be disappointed honestly if you pay to watch this movie then you are wasting your money and if you don t pay anything then you are still wasting an hour and a half of your life so do yourself a favor and don t watch it
the pakage implies that warren beatty and goldie hawn are pulling off a huge bank robbery but that s not what i got out of it i didn t get anything in the first half there s a new character without introduction in every other scene the first half hour is completely incomprehensible the rest is just one long annoying underlit chase scene there s always an irritating sound in the background whether it s a loud watch ticking a blaring siren a train whistling or even the horrible score by quincy jones there are a lot of parts that are laughably bad too like the bad guys chasing beatty on thin ice with a car or the police arriving at the scene roughly fifteen times i really hated this movie
he was my hero for all time until he went along with if you can call it a movie i went to the show to watch it and come out and not just asking for me money back but asked for double the money thats how bad my hero s acting and the hole thing was i can t believe that steven segal s career has hit so low that he has been reduced to making th rate films with th rate secondary actors i watched this moving expecting to see him beet the crap out of some people the way he usually does when he is reduced to using a single judo chop between the shoulder blades to take out an opponent and the guy falls like a ton of bricks something is wrong the plot is unbelievable as a movie and even if you excuse the visuals and had read this story as a novel you d be left wondering why you had even picked up the book steven segal goes through the motions and seems as if he is only doing this because he is under obligation he shows no effort and no enthusiasm and in some scenes he doesn t show up at all i hate to repeat other peoples comments but the use of stock footage for cut scenes and for visuals of the aircrafts in flight is pathetic the condition of those scenes chopped in is shaky and scenes themselves seemed to have deteriorated over time the zappruder film showing president john f kennedy being assassinated is steadier and cleaner my honest opinion is to tell you not to waste your time seeing this movie it is not up to the standards of his work in the glimmer man or exit wounds i read one review that said the movie had a million dollar budget segal being paid of that and that the movie still came in under budget i must concur it is no wonder that this is a direct to dvd movie as no conscientious theater owner would play this movie
this show had pretty good stories but bad dialog the main character was especially annoying it s quite obvious why this show was canceled although like most upn shows i never knew it even existed until it was in syndicated re runs most of it s plots seemed to be copied from other shows and movies leading me to think the producers didn t have an original idea in their heads i haven t commented enough you ve got to have at least ten lines of text the special effect were not bad for a show the gnome was a nice character
i watched the entire movie recognizing the participation of william hurt natascha mcelhone and desiree nosbusch i m glad that i had no idea of the presence of peter weller at the end of the movie i said that was peter weller kudos to mr weller for an outstanding performance weller played a major character and his performance was such that i didn t even recognize him overall the plot was bad the writing was bad and the performances aside from those of nosbusch and weller were subpar the scenery and setting were interesting and weller was amazing stars of a possible
a few months ago i was involved in a debate with another imdb poster hey kmadden about this film the poster insisted that if i gave flushed away a chance i would like it based partially on that argument i agreed to watch the film flushed away has good intentions at least on aardman s part but lacks the strength to pull it all together its best asset is sewer rat boat captain rita played by kate winselt who imo should have been the movie s main character instead of roddy hugh jackman rita s cool tough and interesting while roddy spends much of his screen time sniveling one of the things that bothered me most about fa is the repetition of jokes that aren t funny to begin with when roddy gets hit in the crouch the film makes sure he gets hit five more times immediately my name s shocky says one of rita s brothers who then electrocutes roddy at least three times my tolerance for cheap gags that involve pain is at an all time low i won t waste time griping about katzenberg s kleptomaniac tendencies toward pixar one similar film s a coincidence five s a rip off but i will say i m disappointed in aardman they can do and have done so much better try harder next time guys
the man in the attic is a movie set in the s it is inspired by a true story unfortunately it s a story that really didn t need to be told looking at the box the people responsible for packaging the movie tried their best to make this film appear steamy and erotic they use terms such as illicit passion forbidden affair and unlimited pleasures they even show a picture of neil patrick harris little doogie howser m d holding a gun the story involves krista played by anne archer she is unhappily married to a gentleman who owns his own business edward harris is an employee of her husband s company krista and edward end up falling in love with each other the supposedly shocking part of the movie is this krista s husband finds out about the affair and forbids them from ever seeing each other again so what do they decide to do krista ends up having edward live up in their attic wow krista ends up seeing someone else and edward gets extremely jealous so on and so on and so on the man in the attic doesn t cover any new territory it s a showtime original picture which explains why the stars are a couple of b list actors and both appear briefly in the buff
i loved watching the original azumi with its mix of live action manga compelling storyline cool soundtrack directing kitamura rocks editing and not to mention the beautiful aya ueto who filled the part perfectly so i was really looking forward to seeing azumi but after finally seeing it i felt like i had won the lotto and lost the ticket azumi picks up where azumi left off however these are completely different movies the pace is a lot slower the action is not as exciting and as well choreographed and there is not a lot of character development this was apparently directed by the same guy responsible for further reducing the value of the toho monster franchise if that is possible i agree with some other past reviewers who say that this was a lost opportunity if only ryuhei kitamura continued with this installment there is however some beautiful japanese forest scenery to look at while the slow action unfolds and we are introduced all too briefly to bit characters who quickly get killed off even the real bad guys get killed off too easily without too much of a fight the fight with the spider guy straight out of an episode of monkey in the bamboo forest was about the only memorable fight scene wheras in azumi we had a climactic fight scene with barrel camera effects azumi brought us the azumi cape cam azumi s rampage at the end was unconvincing but aya still does an okay job she looks great in the cape but where did she get it from i don t think i will be watching this one over and over again what a pity
the problem with the killer elite is that just by seeking this film out and investing time to watch it you are putting more effort into the experience than many of its principals did particularly director sam peckinpah the already volatile peckinpah was heading into rough weather with this film according to at least one biographer this was where he became acquainted with cocaine add to that his binge drinking and it s no wonder things fell apart it s a shame because the concept behind the film is a good one and the first ten minutes promise much mike locken james caan and george hansen robert duvall are private contractors who do a lot of dirty work for the cia they move quick live well and seem like the best of friends then something happens to shatter their brotherhood an opening scene shows them blowing up a building why exactly we aren t told par for the course in terms of this film s murky motivation but the implication is these guys hurt people and don t really care antiheroes much like the wild bunch of peckinpah s not so long ago an opening title tells us they work for comteg then adds with obvious tongue in cheek the thought the cia might employ such an organization for any purpose is of course preposterous that s a pretty clever way of letting the audience know all bets are off add to that a traditionally strong peckinpah backup cast including burt young gig young and peckinpah regular bo hopkins in the plum role of a madman who can t pass up an opportunity to be shot at for a day and you only wish that the scriptwriters including the celebrated sterling silliphant tried to do something more with the story than turn it into a platform for lazy one liners and bad chop socky knockoffs an attempt at injecting a dose of liberal social commentary is awkwardly shoehorned in you re so busy doing their dirty work you can t tell who the bad guys are someone tells locken as if either he or we need it pointed out worse still are peckinpah s clumsy direction and sluggish pacing we re minutes into the film before we get our first battle scene a completely chaotic collection of random shots where a bunch of people we haven t even met before are seen fighting at san francisco airport their battle intercut with a conversation in an office suite by the end of the film what s left of the cast is having a battle inside a fleet of mothballed victory ships ninjas running out in the open to be gunned down while caan tosses off one liners that undercut any hint of real suspense lay me seven to five i ll take the little guy he wisecracks just before a climatic samurai duel between two ninja warriors from china which we all know is the land of the ninja the battle takes place in san francisco but surprisingly no mounties arrive to break things up caan is much better in smaller scenes like when locken recovering from some nasty injuries is told by one of his bosses played by a smooth arthur hill that he s been humpty dumped by the organization caan refuses to stay down and his recovery scenes though momentum killing for the movie feature fine acting from him and amy heflin van s daughter as a supportive nurse caan was one of the s best actors and his laconic byplay with heflin duvall hopkins and both youngs give killer elite real watchability but you don t watch killer elite thinking about that you watch it thinking of the film that got away
this movie rivals plan as one of the dumbest movie ever made always be concerned when the same person is the star director producer writer stuntman and editor unfortunately justin kreinbrink did all jobs imdb shows that he and his father were western stunt men so maybe that was the problem here s just one example from the film in the film the sheriff has to take a witness to another town for protection of course the bad guys find out and are waiting for them but what happens the good guys are riding along and a shot rings out and hits a tree near them when the camera shows us the bad guys they re all just sitting on a log chatting what s wrong with this picture i could go on perhaps this film was meant as a comedy if so it didn t do that well either
flat characters that you do not and never will care about cringe inducing dialogue at places no twists they think they have one but if you didn t figure it out after about mins you re not too bright lots of well know actors in roles and performances that fortunately for everyone involved will be forgotten as soon as the end credits roll i don t mind slow movies but they ve got to be going somewhere this one doesn t the plot wasn t what made this a direct to dvd movie that s just a rather convenient excuse to try and drum up some fake controversy the as of writing ten ratings must be from people involved with the production
like some of the other reviewers have alluded to previously i d like to know what moron actually read the script and went yea this is it this is the next film we are going to green light and whoever that person is should have his or her head examined for actual brain activity because whoever is responsible for actually dishing out money to have this made after reading the script well i d love to give you my email address and maybe you d like to just give away some more money this film is atrocious in every way the wayans are funny at least they can be they have made some good films and had some incredibly funny performances along the way but in here not only does the premise defy all logic not only is the acting terrible not only is the entire movie offensive from start to finish not only is the direction as amateurish as you can find but they actually want you to pay to see this film maybe if it was free naaah it would still be a waste of time usually i d be inclined to write some long winded detailed review about why this film is so bad but just suffice to say that let my brevity do the talking this is the lowest common denominator film making and it is about as unfunny as a heart attack makes my top ten list of worst films of all time
i enjoyed the movie very much emotionally intellectually and visually it contains no violence or sex or drugs or special effects and doesn t need them one bit holding my attention the entire time with the visuals story and interspersed words of wisdom however some of the foreign language accents made the dialog difficult to hear understand there is unnecessary overuse of swearing especially the f word which is the only reason this movie was rated r the movie is balanced with humor and emotion but most of the emotion that holds you throughout the film except the final resolution last minutes is unpleasant due to the exaggerated long lasting dysfunctional reaction of some of the characters to loss living in the depths of bitterness and depression for too long i will not recommend this movie because of seconds of background narration which did not add one bit to the side character it applied to or the film it only turned me off to the movie and stuck in my brain through the whole movie and afterward the main character s mother of german ancestry when watching old wwii movies secretly roots for the germans there would be no local color or art if the nazi s won the war i don t know of any germans today except radical skinheads who think the world would be a better place if the nazi s won wwii
i m sorry to say this but the acting in this film is horrible the dialogue sounds as if they are reading their lines for the first time ever perhaps i got the dress rehearsal version by mistake the director over uses slow motion during special effects perhaps as an attempt to compensate for the poor performance of the actors themselves the story is pretty well written and the fight sequences are actually better than i have seen in many action films the fights seem pretty real but all of this happens while to two leading actors time and time again miraculously survive incredible amounts of point blank automatic weapon fire grenades morter rounds and bazookas the enemy soldiers are definitely some of the worst shots i have ever seen especially when they have the escaping truck in their sights from about yards and every bazooka shot is wide by at least feet those bazookas need serious site calibration
i like brad pitt enormously he is an actor with brains and wit not to mention face pectorals and all the rest since i saw him in thelma and louise a thought has been bothering me who does he remind me of troy did it for me he is the new brigitte bardot the differences are obvious of course male american etc but brigitte bardot comes to mind nonetheless he is so beautiful that he is at his most effective when he plays against it kalifornia monkeys fight club snatch his self deprecating humor makes him human almost accessible fortunately troy will soon be forgotten only still photographs with pitt semi naked in ravishing sprint positions will decorate the walls of legions of salivating fans strange das boot is one of the great films of the second part of the th century what is wolfgang petersen doing directing this well i suppose it would be very hard to say no at the chance of working with the new brigitte bardot
i wasn t particularly impressed by this movie that has lackluster music and only lasts minutes thank god because i was falling asleep i makes excellent use of time lapse photography to display the passage of time in the movement of light and shadow people water clouds etc unfortunately that s all it is my preference is for its predecessor the excellent koyaanisqatsi made in at minutes and to prove that a sequel can be better than the original powaqqatsi made in running minutes try them both
having read the comments on the site i feel compelled to write in for the first time it seems this movie is like marmite and has split the audience i have to say that while i agree films don t have to make sense to be enjoyable see mulholland drive they still have to engage you with the characters now while i was totally absorbed by the murderous lesbian affair in lynch s opus i have to say i couldn t give a turd about mr green or the other cardboard gangsters that inhabited this dayglo world also while so many people seem to try and say you didn t enjoy because you didn t get it i would have to disagree i didn t enjoy because i was bored i wanted the film to end and constantly listening to those quotes over and over again did not help call it clever if you will i think it s repetitious however my main reason for writing is to ask all the other reviewers a question there were no end credits on the print of the film i saw just music over black did i watch a dud print or is this evidence of gr s pretentiousness or did everyone involved in the movie watch the rough cut and have their name removed
you could say that the actors will make a movie but this clearly proves that statement wrong most of the characters in this film lack anything to hold on to they play the part of cardboard cut outs being moved about in predictable and uninteresting ways the story is very simple it could be summed up in a few words but i ll hold back in case anyone reading does want to see this film i had to fast forward the parts where jack showed us how to be an obnoxious eater i d have to say that of this film revolved around cooking eating or getting ready to eat quite frankly i d rather not spend my time watching jack chew noisily with an open mouth personally i could have done without the footwear references and jokes that pepper the first half of the film too outside of my own personal dementia the film really lacked anything worth it s time there were countless scenes and camera shots that felt like it was dragging when something happens the reactions of the characters are vague and dry best not to look this one up
excruciatingly slow paced over scripted black comedy with a too clever premise and bad acting maybe this would have worked as a twilight zone or tales from the crypt episode but by the last half you just want it to get to its predictable ending and be done with it already
well i hated knocked up i despised year old virgin and this little gem is a worthless piece of trash movie do yourself a favor and skip it i admit i don t like the actors in this movie and after my year old son showed me the cover of the dvd i was like i wouldn t like that movie but at his insistence i decided to give it a try unfortunately about two minutes into the movie i turned it off i was so offended it s just disgusting any decent person would be offended by the filth in this movie call me old fashioned but shoving your pussy juice covered hand into your friend s face so he will know you got some is over the line of decency in my opinion yeah that s how this putrid little film starts and i can only imagine it gets much worse from there another real winner for mr rudd i bet he s proud as punch imagine if you could only get worthless roles like he gets would you stay in movies despite the pay i wouldn t i should have known better next time i will
this was the first sequel i d seen apart from return of jafar and i honestly thought before watching it that it would be close to the original i was horribly disappointed the storyline was basically the first script with a few extra characters and the situation turned around ariel and eric have a daughter melody who isn t satisfied with life on land she wants to become a mermaid however ariel has kept her past from her daughter because she wants to protect her and when melody finds out she s upset and angry and she then decides to run away and she becomes a mermaid so she s happy swimming around and ariel sets out to find her as a mermaid the story doesn t sound too bad written down but the clich s and repeats of situations from the first movie are just too obvious and adding the fact that melody is overall extremely annoying and the movie becomes almost unbearable there s also a whole load of other new characters tip and dash being two of them they aren t too bad as characters in themselves just try not to think of timon or pumbaa the songs leave a lot to be desired too they just don t have the same magical energy as the songs from the original did the animation obviously didn t have a whole load of work put into it either in parts it s jumpy and not much imagination is used for the characters movements another piece of advice try to forget about ariel s original character while watching this movie the beautiful rebellious curious teenager has all grown up into a bland boring wife and mother and her trademark red hair is all tied up this is much better viewed if you ve never seen the original you ll have nothing to compare it to however all in all it could have been worse it s not as bad as certain other sequels such as cinderella ii but it s not in the same league as the original but it for your collection if nothing else but if disney go on like this they ll lose all their older fans
this movie is horrible everything in it has been done before there is nothing original i cannot stand when writers don t come up with their own plots a girl makes a wish on her th birthday and wakes up as an adult hmm sounds a lot like a movie in the s called big what is even more annoying is jennifer garner s acting she doesn t act like she is she just acts like she is stupid from then on you can guess the whole plot she gets a good job and it just so happens that a friend she had at works with her wow how awesome but no her friend is bad and turns on her trying to get her job but of course she wins in the end when she comes up with a great idea there s also a dancing scene in the movie that i ve seen a thousand times before i hate this movie
yes i ll admit it i believed all the hype surrounding this piece of work about the trials and tribulations of people living in mexico city concerning their sexual lives and so i was really expecting to finally see a mexican movie in ages that was both popular and interesting to watch unfortunately the film was utterly disappointing the story presents us with two couples both with very obvious marital problems when a third party comes into the life of each couple their problems reach a pivotal point or absolute absurd the plot then turns into a battle of the sexes the stance taken by each group yes they literally group girls with girls and boys with boys is blatantly stupid and childish i guess the humor was supposed to be there and it all goes from bad to worse the performances range from good miss zavaleta to mediocre mr bichir with serrano doing an acceptable job on his opera prima however the flat circumstances that make up the plot the one dimensional characters the very poor if not stupid perception of what sex represents in a mature relationship etc make the movie fail miserably spyl has had an impressive good reception at the box office believe the hype at your own risk
after having seen the movie the first question arising in my mind was is this supposed to be irony or not after reading a few comments about the character doc savage and the comic series i knew this film was not meant to be ironic so the story tells us about an us american super doc saving a south american republic from evil sounds like a typical story but this one comes in such an unrealistic way that it becomes ridiculous the mandatory end fight shows the worst presentation of martial arts i have ever seen the film might be interesting for low budget movie designers as a bad example
a missed train a wrong phone number an extra cup of coffee what happens to those around you when you make a seemingly innocuous decision most people don t give it a thought as they absorbed in their own thoughts and actions happenstance tells the story of the interrelations and cause and effect of the mundane as it pertains to a group of normal parisian folk it has all the components of what passes for contemporary theater with the full cast of the dysfunctional and disillusioned there s a cheating husband an illegal immigrant a classic slacker a pickpocket a crazy grandmother an annoying girlfriend a selfish roommate and a homeless man audrey tautou serves as the erstwhile protagonist in the sense that she s on camera as much as anyone else and opens and closes the film and normal girl who just can t seem to find the right rhythm in her life she learns at the beginning of her day from a stranger on a train what her horoscope holds for her what happens to her in the course of the day is told through various characters does the prediction come true the concept is good but the storytelling is flimsy the connections from one event to the next are weak there s better storytelling in seconds of the liberty mutual insurance commercial where one person sees a good deed and passes it along to another than there is in two hours of happenstance if you enjoy audrey tautou then you certainly can sacrifice the time for this film but you ll finish it dissatisfied and wondering what this same storyline could be if it were handled by a better producer and director
you may want to know up front that i am not a mormon unlike a good number of those who have already reviewed this film i mention this so you ll understand that the way i look at the film may differ greatly from those in the faith for some being critical of the film might be seen as being critical of the faith and that is not my intention so my review is that of an outsider trying to look inside and learn more about who this man and his people were well after seeing the film i doubt if i have learned much at all since i have been a history teacher i have a good basic understanding about young as well as joseph smith as well as the teachings of the church but anyone wanting to see this film to really learn anything will probably be disappointed because the film seems so gosh darn nice too nice and too unrealistic in its portrayal plus you learn practically nothing about the church s beliefs other than they are nice people work hard and some have many wives and this latter part is only barely hinted at in the film instead the people are almost cartoon like in their simplistic portrayals joseph smith and brigham young and their followers are angelic the non mormons were all devils and brian donlevy playing exactly the same sort of role edward g robinson later played in the ten commandments is the trouble maker who claims to be a mormon but just comes along so the film can have a bad guy it s all so very simple too simple almost like an indoctrination film or infomercial brigham young especially was a very complex man with many good points an excellent organizer and visionary as well as bad don t even get me started on his views about blacks within the church or intermarriage to portray him in such vague terms is just plain silly it s also a lot like how gandhi was portrayed in the film with ben kingsley only the facts that led to his being almost super human were emphasized heck now that i think about that this is the trouble with most religious films they often come off as one dimensional trite and bland let s have a full and more complete film of these men one that will stick to facts and not emotional appeals now if you can ignore the fact that you won t learn very much about the faith or its second leader the film is enjoyable enough it s obvious someone at th century fox really cared about the film as they had a wonderful cast of both premier actors tyrone power up and coming actors linda darnell jane darwell and vincent price and wonderful character actors dean jagger john carradine and brian donlevy the film also had wonderful location shooting and lots of gloss it just didn t have a lot to tell us other than they were all swell plus there were plenty of factual errors and a few just plain dumb scenes a few of the mistakes include young taking over the helm immediately after the death of joseph smith it was three years later no mention of the various mormon denominations and splinter groups talk of gold in california even though it was and gold wouldn t be discovered until as well as no specific mention of polygamy or smith s many wives just plain dumb scenes include carradine pulling out a gun and waving it about in the courtroom scene and no one seemed to care even though it was a very hostile audience don t you think at least the judge would tell him to put it away and stop threatening people with it one final comment do not i repeat do not watch this film when it s shown on american movie classics a one great station that has sunk a lot in recent years while i am critical of the film because of its simplistic message i was horrified with the complete disrespect the station had for the church and its traditions what i mean is this the film was punctuated with ads for penis enlargement formulas as well as tons of pop ups some advertising a show that features the sexiest cast talk about disrespectful and gross and i would be just as offended if they did this for any other religious film by doing this they not only insult the faith but marginalize their market after all who is into hearing about these things and the life of brigham young is this a movie in this form that you can show to your kids or recommend to others
horrible film about an old crusty painter who hangs around with a young girl boring tatum o neil goes through the motions in her part and has some of the corniest lines in film history richard burton looks close to death in this film and we re supposed to believe he looks good for sixty the acting is bad as is the plot the characters are awful as is the story it s really hard to feel for anyone in this film except larry ewashen who plays a guy in a porno theater who hits on tatum he s kind of funny this movie is really a waste of time if you are a tatum fan like me which is why i rented it in the first place please don t see this movie she is really bad in it and you ll wonder if maybe paper moon was a fluke it wasn t because of bad news bears and little darlings it s known she can act well but still don t rent this movie and if you re a fan of burton rent something when he was good looking and not a fossil
first ifc runs town and country and now this the difference between that stinker and this pink panther rip off is that town and country was watchable this isn t i can only surmise that the cast signed up for this so they could goof off in europe on somebody else s dime belushi is especially irritating his scene with candy doing a z grade dom deluise was torture speaking of torture five minutes of the talentless shepherd and i bet the prisoners at gitmo would crack like walnuts the real crime besides this being green lighted is shepherd s character a mousy wife who takes a monte carlo casino for a half million bucks if you buy that i have some oceanfront property in arizona you might be interested in
nick cage is gates a treasure hunter oh excuse me treasure protector whatever that means who is descended from a long line of treasure hunters one of his ancestors had been given a clue to the whereabouts of a huge treasure that our founding fathers most if not all freemasons had decided to hide because they just didn t want to finance their independence all that badly the first clue turns out to be in a long lost ship hidden in the arctic gates and his crew consisting of financier ian sean bean movie dork riley justin bartha of the immortal gigli and a couple of faceless lackeys enter the cargo hold of the ship they immediately spill out tons of gunpowder all over the floor not that this is significant in any way at last they find the clue a skeleton is hovering over it and it turns out to be a pipe with writing on it sort of don t ask me to explain it s a riddle and despite the fact that his expedition is clearly miffed at not finding the actual treasure gates wanders around yammering to himself about the meaning of the riddle in this frozen cargo hold while the crew just stands around slack jawed i mean come on someone should have been a little vocal in their disappointment of coming all the way to the freaking arctic and not finding anything interesting but they just stand there as gates enters his own world solving the riddle the next clue turns out to be on the declaration of independence ian decides to steal it gates is appalled various characters deliver gratingly obvious exposition get used to it all this leads to ian s lackey pulling a gun on gates and the gunpowder going off in a big explosion oh that s why they spilled all the gunpowder huh ian and his henchmen make their escape and gates and movie dork riley walk nine miles in subzero temperatures to an inuit village in order to stop them to stop them gates concludes after trying the fbi and super archivist abigail chase diane kruger gates and riley must steal it themselves riley then tells gates in excruciating detail why they can not steal the declaration because it s so protected with metal and laser eyes and high tech security blah blah gates then tells riley that there s an opportunity to steal it from the preservation room does riley know what the preservation room is gates asks a place where they make jams and jellies i am not kidding that s the actual line bartha doesn t deliver it like a joke either so riley does all this research about the library of congress and the archives and water and sewage fercryinoutloud but doesn t know what the preservation room is this pretty much indicates what level this script is on to make the rest of this short gates does in fact make off with the d of i in a ridiculous break in that could only happen in a movie i also hate the way they depict computer monitor technology in movies full of improbable and impractical graphics and fonts abigail chase ends up tagging along for convenience s sake and as an obvious love interest angle at one point the three of them on the run from the law discuss all their plans really loudly in a clothing store surrounded by people a series of clues and the kidnapping of gates father played by a dyspeptic jon voight leads good guys and bad guys alike to a huge indiana jones fun house located underneath new york city odd that the subway builders never found this thing gates and gates senior lead ian off on a wild goose chase ian believes they re trapped in a cul de sac and leaves them there however after they re gone riley asks how they re going to get out gates oh boy presses a button and a door opens no i m serious a button like they might have on a vacu flush lavatory in an office building good thing he knew where that was anyway after some more knob twiddling they find this immense treasure room remember this is all underneath manhattan full of all sorts of historyish golden things riley gets to deliver a really stupid line again and fbi officer harvey keitel forgives them arrests sean bean and allows the two chemistry less leads to get married for any viewer i think it would be hard to ignore all the exposition the leaps of logic and the stereotyped characters for very long though some of its exposition involves nice history lessons inserted into conversation at random moments i d like more conversations like that in my life
this is the only movie that my wife and i have ever walked out on totally sucked we saw it in omaha even not funny at all looks like a year old kid wrote the humor i can t believe these real politicians were actually in the movie awful
spoilers of both this and the matrix follow i liked the original matrix a great deal it was not a deep movie despite fishburne s attempts to philosophize but it was fairly well paced fun and i have a soft spot for hong kong fights in the original neo was the secret life of the rather unhappy cube worker anderson by day corporate drone and by night brave hacker eventually he eventually is forced to choose between these lives by his actions does he become an outlaw fighting the machine or does he go back to the safe forgettable world he started in interestingly he discovers that once one is shorn of illusions life rather sucks he has his girl by his side and his boon companions but he eats processed swill dresses in sweats and lives in a truly skungy bit of machinery still the truth makes him free at least part of the fun of that first movie lay in the what if it were me questions raised in the viewer s mind what if i were capable of the impossible what if i were the one it does not even matter that much what you are the one example of with a cool title like that further agent smith made a wonderful bad guy as he embodied all of the fear of authority that we carry with us he was as unstoppable as a terminator and as merciless at the end of the matrix neo must return to the matrix to share his good news of freedom this movie fails to completely to carry through on the ideas of the original movie and it does so with such lack of gusto such poor scriptwriting and such poor editing that i cannot believe they had planned these changes when the dialog is at a fifth grade level with various long words dropped in randomly i find it hard to believe that they understand what they are saying my short list of characterization failures the oracle goes from mildly helpful if deceitful to utterly obstructionist without any real reason major personalities of the matrix are introduced without need the keymaster for example was a cute idea but just not that interesting a character fishburne loses his advisor role and gets nothing to replace it with the people of zion are not particularly likable nor would you really want them running the world special effects problems the fight scenes are pointless and intermitable in the matrix you felt neo could lose and that he had to become something greater in order to survive in the matrix reloaded he is merely the viewpoint character of a particularly poorly plotted video game the fight on the freeway looked quite fake and not that interesting pacing problems as i mentioned above the fight scenes were interminable the rave went on too long everyone in my row at the theater was looking at their watch not because we mind good dancing and good orgies but because we did not know about the people pictured nor did we care whatever hack wrote the creator s soliloquy should be blacklisted from the business it meandered used words that the scriptwriter clearly did not understand and was a waste of time and a pacing killer the creator s speech could have been done in a tenth the time and with more peril as zion exists to give rebels a place to go so they do not destroy the matrix there are now too many people who do not believe the matrix is in danger of crashing and killing every person hooked up to it further the earth cannot support even the people in zion let alone these others you may choose one person from zion to form the new zion while i wipe the memories of the people currently in the matrix instead we got a long drawn out bunch of twaddle if someone argues that it is deep ask for a transcript and try breaking down the sentences each one is too long by several clauses and uses words with clearer shorter synonyms so in summary not worth seeing i have seen the third one and despite what a number of reviewers have said skip it it does not save this turkey the reviewers who feel that the second and third movies were deep should go see some truly deep movies perhaps read a book or two on rhetoric and debate and perhaps a bit of philosophy this movie is just not hard to understand but it is hard to stomach scott
so i thought i d throw in a few words about william mcnamara not a bad way to spend a couple of hours if you want to see him in his tighty whities it s obvious he pumped up for this role and he looks pretty darn good in them or less there s an extended sequence in a cave where he has to strip down to his undies there s a nice bit where he has to chase after miss eleniak in the buff with only his hands cupped over his groin william mcnamara is naturally a little on the skinny side but he has a nice generous handful of a booty also there s a moment when he s getting out of bed that if you pause the action at just the right moment you can see the whole enchilada if you re inclined to do so and come on half of the people who choose to watch a movie about navy men on a road trip are i d just like thank dennis hopper for his equal opportunity gratuitous nudity can william mcnamara act heck if i know
for every series that makes it to television a ideas are formed scripts are written pilots are made and one just one actually makes it to production from such a selection process we are lead to believe that the final product must be the cream of the crop for what other reason could so many ideas be rejected to give us a single television series and so it goes with true blood all the stars were in alignment and what started as a series of novels was transformed into an idea a screen play a pilot and finally a series unfortunately it can sometimes be a long journey and along the way there are many turns that ultimately change what was good and pure into and show that production people feel would be best for ratings oh how wrong they so often are true blood is an example of a creative concept that has developed into one of the poorest story lines worst acting and silliest subplots as anything in recent television history its international cast of relatively unknown actors struggle to find their voices but keep tripping over their fake southern accents alan ball s not so secret desires for ryan jason stackhouse gives us a fresh nude shot each week although it often has nothing to do with the storyline tara s angry black woman characterization fails to connect and you find yourself secretly hoping the vamps take her out quickly before she goes into another speech about white suppression while attend a ceremony for the glorious dead of the confedercy sam finds suppressed love for sookie and suddenly we are to believe he needs to watch over her morning noon and night despite years of working with her and avoiding any such relationship as for bill the vampire his moral high ground is quickly surrendered at the first chance to make love with sookie and has no issue with make a quick snack of her although she remains somewhat unharmed we find the other vampires not so mainstream as bill but greatly desiring to become accepted by a public as they look at the living as happy meals with legs despite my best efforts of suffering through the first six episodes i have come to the realization that no matter how long you watch a bad show its still bad somethings die for a reason even vampires maybe this show should to
anita and me is a drama about growing up in multi ethnic britain rather like bend it like beckham or more closely east is east with which it shares a s setting the tone is resolutely chirpy in spite of the dour black country accents but the film lacks east is east s vigour and the result seems rather thin and trite moreover the portrayal of the film s central relationship between an asian girl and her white friend is insufficiently deep to justify the way that the movie is structured around it i have also grown tired of films where the hero years to be a writer this is naturally often something that real writers have experienced but hardly a fresh element in a fictional story east is east was fun and sharp anita and me seems obvious and dull in comparison
simon pegg stars as sidney young a stereotypically clumsy idiot brit working as a celebrity journalist in this us comedy after getting a very lucky break he starts work at the highly respected sharps magazine run by a reliably on form jeff bridges in new york it s more the devil wears prada than shaun of the dead the unlikely love interest is provided by kirsten dunst who works well with pegg for the laughs but they don t exactly set the screen ablaze with their passion sidney goes through some emotional challenges while trying to decide if he should forget about his journalistic principles in order to get material in the magazine of course he s eventually seduced by the glitz and glamour of the world of celebrities especially the young starlet sophie maes transformers megan fox fans of shaun of the dead hot fuzz and spaced will wonder if pegg himself ever experienced similar feelings in real life with this film and to an extent run fat boy run as one of the uk s best comic talents being ruined by the us all in all this is a forgettable comedy please come back to us simon we can forgive and forget
it s kind of fascinating to me that so many reviewers consider this a masterpiece i am not a dullard as far as quality films go and i will agree that from a technical filming standpoint as well as for several of the characters portrayed the film is in an award worthy class but there is no sense for me of this film actually going anywhere i mean taking the viewer anywhere it is a series of mood scenes perhaps remarkable as such but i want more from a film i look for story and movement and a fulfillment of arrival none of which did i find in this film yes it might be considered poetry on film but there is much poetry that i cannot live with for the same reason that it paints pictures without going anywhere one thing further to be said is that it documents a mid century english childhood which is necessarily limited in its universality i was personally appalled at what a young british boy had to live through in that time and place having grown up in america just a decade earlier i can authoritatively say that the contrast is immense i cannot help wondering if this contrast has had some effect on those reviewing the film so favorably in other words could there be a tendency to judge the film entirely on its filmic magic which i acknowledge is there and completely ignore its lack of relevance to the nature of one s actual recalled experience
when sam peckinpah s superlative the wild bunch opened the door to outrageous displays of graphic cinematic ultra violence it did so with a talented if whisky marinated hand guiding the camera and had a compelling story with characters who had actual depth but in no time flat there were scores of imitators that fell far from the benchmark set by peckinpah s epic and soldier blue definitely falls into that category soldier blew er blue tells the story of foul mouthed new yorker cresta lee candice bergen a blonde proto hippie chick who s been rescued from two years of captivity among the cheyenne and is now being sent to a fort where she ll be reunited with the fianc e she only wants to marry for his money also on board the wagon she s traveling in is a shipment of government gold cash the cheyenne need to buy guns with so in short order the soldiers are wiped out and cresta flees to the hills accompanied by honus gant peter strauss the lone surviving cavalryman calling gant by the snarky nickname soldier blue cresta demonstrates that her years among the savages was time well spent outstripping gant in survival skills common sense and sheer balls and over their journey toward the fort they must persevere against the elements a band of hostile kiowa an unscrupulous trader played by donald pleasance here giving one of his most ridiculous performances and that s saying something and in the tradition of many previous western set romantic comedies each other during the course of their misadventures the two opposites are inevitably and predictably attracted to each other and eventually end up getting it on while gant has a freshly treated bullet wound that went clean through his leg no less in what was surely the only conveniently located cave for at least a twelve mile radius that wasn t filled with rattlesnakes mountain lions or who knows what to say nothing of the cheyenne who could have done something really spiffy with such a primo apartment there i go thinking in nyc real estate terms again realizing that their love could never flourish outside of the cave cresta leaves gant and makes it to the fort by herself only to discover that the moron in charge won t spare a couple of men so they can rescue gant the regiment needs all available personnel to launch an attack on the nearby cheyenne village and once cresta gets wind of that she slips past her obnoxiously horny hubby to be and makes a beeline straight to the cheyenne to warn them of what s coming what happens next is what gained the film its infamy it turns out that all the wacky misadventures and squabbling were all just a lead in to a hideous reenactment of the sand creek massacre an orgy of rape torture and general sadistic evil perpetrated in the name of keeping the country clean and almost forty years after its release this sequence still disturbs and nauseates for its sheer cruelty children are trampled beneath the hooves of charging horses or impaled on bayonets unarmed people are beheaded a nice effect i have to admit women are stripped and pawed by gangs of slavering brutes then raped and mutilated in one truly sickening instance a naked native woman puts up too much of a fight so her rapist instead decides to cut off her breasts which we thankfully only see the start of before the camera moves on to chronicle some other hideous act and scores of innocent people are shot and dismembered their compone nt parts impaled on pikes and waved about in victorious celebration or kept as the most ghoulish of souvenirs no joke this scene would instantly garner an nc rating if released today to say nothing of possibly spurring native american interest groups to riot in the streets over the incredibly exploitative manner in which the atrocities are depicted i m all in favor of westerns that don t shy away from honest portrayals of how the west was won or stolen if truth be told but this film has no idea of what kind of movie it wants to be one minute it s a heavy handed pseudo hippy lecture about how the treatment of the natives was totally effed up well duh then it s a light hearted battle of the sexes farce wherein cresta proves herself five times the man gant is and manages to look hot in her tasty red calico poncho with no undies but that all goes out the window when donald pleasance shows up with an unintentionally hilarious pair of buck toothed dentures and our heroes must figure out how to escape from his murderous clutches in a sub plot that goes nowhere all of which culminates in the aforementioned apocalyptic climax any one of those tacks would have been okay for a coherent film but the end result is a slapdash mess that milked the horrors of its final ten minutes for all they were worth in the film s promotion and poster imagery but by trying to be all things to all audiences soldier blue ends up as an incoherent preachy mulligan stew of presumably well intentioned political correctness but if they were going to tell the story of the sand creek massacre wouldn t it have been a good idea to have some indian characters who were more than just walk ons with murphy brown acting as their mouthpiece we get to know absolutely nothing of the people who get wiped out solely for what appears to be a crass ploy to lure gorehound moviegoers into seeing the most savage film in history if you like me were intrigued by the provocative ads and reviews that shower almost endless praise upon it for its daring to tell it like it was take my word for it and let soldier blue slowly fade into cinematic obscurity
although in many ways i agree with the other reviewers comments i find that the plot and idea are very good many of the supporting actors were very good the fatal problem with this film is ellen pompeo i am sure i have never seen a less talented actor how this person has ever been in a film or on television i cannot imagine in my opinion she would be better as a greater at a wal mart to see a person with this low level of talent involved in paying roles does beg the question who does she know i would very much like to see this film re made with some talent i do not fault the writer for the failure of this film to be worth the time to view it
investigative reporter darren mcgavin as carl kolchak is back this time he s after the night strangler once again police officials and fellow journalists either disbelieve or want to cover up the supernatural angle producer director dan curtis presents the same basic story as his preceding night with understandably less success mr curtis assembles a fun supporting cast included are dark shadows alumni george dicenzo and ivor francis jo ann pflug as louise harper heads up a sexy collection of belly dancers and although i ve never seen it mentioned anywhere that must be roger davis as mr mcgavin s dining companion in an early scene feigning disbelief in the existence of vampires the night strangler dan curtis darren mcgavin jo ann pflug simon oakland wally cox

in recent times i have been subjected to both this movie and king arthur on dvds chosen by others for an evening s entertainment and together they achieve nothing more than bearing out a growing notion i have that the modern movie watching public totally lacks discrimination and is content as long as they get action both movies were utter rubbish whatever happened to character development whatever happened to meaningful dialogue whatever happened to acting and when watching something that vaguely purports to be historical whatever happened to attempting to capture some measure of accuracy some realistic idea of the political map of the time even some slight flavour of the era especially in its social attitudes why do they all have to display the value set of st century america i have read on the message boards of disclaimers that little was known of the dark ages not so considerable amounts are known with much learned scholarship on the era but these jokers simply couldn t be bothered to do any homework i only wish i could vote
i decided to watch this serial after seeing the endless adverts for it on the bbc in the weeks prior to it starting i watched it despite the fact that i don t like the pretentious kind of stuff that alan hollinghurst writes sorry to his fans but i think we have a case of the emperor s new clothes with this author s work i admit that the acting is excellent it is beautifully shot and i was reasonably entertained by it however i found that the storyline was extremely thin and after watching all three episodes feel very unsatisfied with this rather empty production the explicit gay sex that the media droned on about has all been done before on tv several times so it was nothing very shocking i m afraid full marks for production values but low ones for storyline content i m afraid
does anyone think that this show actually helps some people or does it only anger the people who watch it when i am flipping through the channels and come upon this show i half to watch out of morbid curiosity i understand that pat roberson is not all together what i do not know is if his viewers are like him or if they are good people and think they will have a better life if they listening to what he has to say pat roberson is of little consequence he is an old man who thinks in an old way fear of damnation no longer has the same affects as it once did thank god now if someone will please answer my question i will be dodging lightning bolts for the rest of eternity
my complaints here concern the movie s pacing and the material at hand while using archival film and letters lends the film a fresh and interesting perspective too often the material selected to highlight simply isn t very interesting such as when goebbels complains about this or that ailment tc or the ad nauseam footage of his small german hometown also the movie crawls along in covering c and then steams through the war years in sum the film is little better than a history channel documentary with the exception that the filmmaker has a slightly greater sensibility than your average history channel documentary editor and thus can more artfully arrange the details of goebbels life still i found it wanting
they should have called this movie adopted mouse brother that is slightly inspired by someone s vague recollection of stuart little who just kind of skimmed the book a little but mostly just remembered the cover if it wasn t so misleading i d give it a better review but seriously people do your kids a favor and have them read the book they might actually learn something instead of having their mind numbed by what we all know as hollywood film the book stuart little isn t about a mouse it s about a person who happens to be very small and mouse like he s born to his parents not adopted the book is about his life and his eventual departure from home and the journey he embarks on there is a cat named snowball who thinks he s food and wants to eat him but snowball can t talk in the movie they screw all of that up i think the only things that they kept from the book were the boat race and the names
great cast great acting unpredictable story line for the first halfhour or so i was really wanting to know what was going tohappen to each of these unredeeming characters and how theirseemingly disparate lives would become intertwined but whenthe writers took out the glue to start connecting the players theymistakenly used super glue and brought the movie to a standstillfor the last two hours i kept thinking it would get better but it onlygot worse don t believe the reviews this is a waste of time think about it tom cruise made ugly why the gorgeoushunky bartender wearing braces why i know it had to do withthe plot but without them at least there would have been oneattractive cast member to remember
yes i was lucky enough to see the long running original production of michael bennett s hit musical it was an amazing experience and i paid to see the movie when it hit theatres back in it is awful almost everything fails first off attenborough a fine actor a good director with the right material is a sorry choice almost as bad as when john huston was hired to mangle annie the camera is always in the wrong place they chop up the songs and the casting they are awful the power of the play was these dancers these hungry talented performers just wanted a chance to show what they could do and when they got their chance you couldn t take your eyes off of them but this cast just gets by dancing does a nice job singing but none of them spark one bit in fact look up the cast on imdb none of them really went on to do anything much ok ok janet jones married gretzky sheesh so this cinema trainwreck does not capture for one second the magic the desperation the passion of the stage musical a total strike out but even though they try to smother the music the great music still rises up at times and reminds people how great the score was
st watched dir eugene levy corny comedy murder mystery with very few laughs the movie appears to be based on an earlier italian movie according to the credits but was re written by two fairly popular american romantic comedy writers but this one by charles shyer nancy meyers does not cut it compared to their other efforts the story is about a couple of down and out traveling americans played by richard lewis and sean young who stumble upon a lost dog and hope to make a fortune in reward money after seeing an ad in the paper for the dachsund s return upon trying to return it they see a hand sticking out of a garage door at the lady s residence that they believe is attached to the rest of the dead body of the woman who is supposed to give them the money they freak out and instead of contacting the police and telling them the truth they make out like runaways from the scene expecting to be framed for the murder the other characters in the film are met on a train prior to this and hang around a monte carlo gambling resort doing various things to be pulled into the story the other cast members include character actors john candy james belushi cybill shepherd george hamilton and others after the police find out about the death they start questioning the main characters and of course they have to work thru their goofy lies to figure out what really happened none of the character actors mentioned earlier can bring this movie out of it s mediocre state despite some funny moments mostly provided by the belushi shepherd couple this isn t a horrible movie it just isn t that good there are plenty of average movies out there and this is just another one for the pile try it maybe you ll like it probably you won t
i was so eager to see this one of my favorite tv shows i saw universal trademark followed with a newly acquainted title and theme song which still impress me computer animation on some scenery like a solid title name the jetsons or a dimension view of a spaceship approaching an amusement park and more made this version splendid and fantastic shortly after that till the end i couldn t believe my eyes how lucky i was that i could forget all i had seen just songs by tiffany and its theme song in new arrangement were in my head anyway i wish to see this space aged family also the flintstones and yogi bear in all graphic computer design as toy story or bug s life the best style for hanna barbera s in my opinion
this show is terrible the jokes are all terrible and just getting worse and worse i am one of those people who was never a big fan of corner gas but at least i liked it at first until it got into a rut around season two all the jokes had been played out and the characters had nothing to them well at least corner gas was good at first little mosque on the prairie is typically awful bland cbc comedy that had nothing going for it from episode who are the people who are watching this show anyway i am being honest is it old people or maybe just people who actually live on the prairies maybe the jokes are for them and they work there i don t know a single person who likes this show and can t stand it myself the jokes are totally predictable and the characters are even less developed than in corner gas hopefully it won t last much longer because all the success this show has had seems to me to be based entirely on the premise of this show being muslim which is different and could should have led to a great show
first let me be honest i did not watch all this movie i watched the first five minutes and when i realized that i had nearly fallen to sleep i decided that i may as well fast forward and see if it got any more interesting later on it didn t this film is just a collection of lame attempts to make a story which is already uninteresting and badly told into something that it would never become a decent horror movie because i feel it is important to say that even a movie with poor special effects can still be good if it is well made this film isn t and will only put you into a deep sleep if you attempt to watch it lastly i feel it is important to say that i think this movie is in the publicdomain so if you feel that you must absolutely watch it than a littlesearch on the internet will surely show you a place where you won t need to pay to watch this pile of cinematographic dung
i just finished watching el otro i have always taken my hat off to julio chavez s performances as he is a great actor but this movie is really depressing and slow i guess that it would have been even worse if it wasn t for julio anyways this is definitely a film that you will never understand if you are not from argentina and even if you are i would advise you not to rent this movie in order to have a nice time with your girlfriend boyfriend family or friends it is really depressing and incredibly slow and the plot does not make a lot of sense neither probably the director wanted to show the fragility of the human life but what he does is bore and impress the audience with scenes that shock you a little bit it gives you something to think about but not in a good way overall i definitely didn t like this movie
wow sheer brilliance turning a thriller suspense horror into comedy after watching this i never laughed so hard at a horror movie before a ridiculous plot with characters that were just insanely developed either not written in depth or too much depth if you want to watch an absolutely written horror movie with stupid dialog messed up plot useless scenes wasted characters bad sound and lousy development overall then this is the one to watch be sure to keep focused for the classic food processor scene and the totally inept police investigation scenes this is a remarkable new low in screen performance and writing and to sit through it for the entire duration makes you either stupid daring or brave
imagine the scenario you are at the movie theater only because you are in washington for the weekend and it s raining and you re finished with the museums you think you might go see the sarah marshall movie as the trailer look so so and you don t have to engage your brain it s sold out options the bank job in bruges the leatherheads or prom night you ve seen the bank job suprisingly decent heist movie that and in bruges again pretty good so you re down to two you don t fancy watching clooney or the nice one from the office run around in football uniforms so you go see prom night right wrong you take the walk up to a stranger in the street and ask him to punch you in the face for it would be money better spent it actually plays like more of a comedy than a horror thriller or whatever it is supposed to be if i was financing that movie and they showed me that as a final cut i wouldn t know whether to laugh or cry probably both an insult to anyone s intelligence my roommate was laughing out loud most of the movie as for the acting they might as well have cast robots or maybe dogs in the roles they would have been more realistic the detective has to be possibly the worst actor i have ever seen ben affleck and hayden christansan i hate his acting so much i don t care how you spell his name you are relieved on your title s so in summary not good
can i do it till i need glasses at the very least proves the point that anyone can make a movie talent is not a consideration the folks who unleashed this wretched pile of spewing vomit upon the world lack any semblance of talent taste or intelligence the target audience must consist of the recently labotimized and infants who play with their own feces anyone else would be far too world wise to get even a snicker out of this film it consists of a series of sophmoric skits in which the punchline does not even extend to the obvious it ends at the ludicrous the jokes told are the types of jokes that elementary school children tell usually potty or sexually related where they don t know the meaning of all of the terms they use you know like the one about daddy s car and mommy s garage to apply any sterner method of criticism would be pointless since the usual standards of acting writing direction and such have never even been heard of by the creative minds behind this mess not to be judgemental but anyone who enjoyed this film should seriously reflect upon their purpose on this earth
after watching this movie i was honestly disappointed not because of the actors story or directing i was disappointed by this film advertisements the trailers were suggesting that the battalion have chosen the third way out other than surrender or die polish infos were even misguiding that they had the choice between being killed by own artillery or german guns they even translated the title wrong as misplaced battalion this have tickled the right spot and i bought the movie the disappointment started when i realized that the third way is to just sit down and count dead bodies followed by sitting down and counting dead bodies then i began to think hey this story can t be that simple i bet this clever officer will find some cunning way to save what left of his troops well he didn t they were just sitting and waiting for something to happen and so was i the story was based on real events of world war i so the writers couldn t make much use of their imagination but even thought i found this movie really unchallenging and even a little bit boring and as i wrote in the first place it isn t fault of actors writers or director their marketing people have raised my expectations high above the level that this movie could cope with
i am not saying that night of the twisters was horrible but it was far from great mediocre at absolute best i seems though that every time one type of movie is released a second must be around the same time think about armageddon and deep impact volcano and dante s peak night of the twisters is really just twister except worse and with mundane special effects i have nothing against the actors who starred in it even if they weren t great it was the movie itself the directing the special effects the whole storyline was just too strange to interpret a series of tornadoes strike a town and basically the movie is about people trying to find family and friends and deal with the damage i really don t know why it seems as though duplicates of disaster movies are released almost in sync with each other but this one would have been better with bill paxton and helen hunt
now here is a film that if made in australia would have easily been a comedy sadly and annoyingly here it is flaccid and cheesy and overbaked from lala land how did the di erector get it so wrong well mainly by being serious about a job so hilariously startling that nobody in their right mind could take seriously unless of course they were a nerdy lonely gay clich but somehow cute or is that clich piled upon clich no value in the story that almost seems like a prequel to gus van sant s gerry and with a title like the fluffer how is it all such a lead weight well this auteur must have soooooo mad that he didn t get to burt and boogie first that he had to make his own convoluted and undeveloped apart from the unrequited love s a bore theme left over from a faded streisand lyric we have only moody beefcake and tv serial level storyline left the un necessary fourth act of this overlong turgid drama is truly terrible as the film wanders off like the gerries into to desert and gets stuck there in oz in the late s some somethings made a similar but actually hilarious film called moneyshot originally filmed as the venus factory it too suffered from an auteur more awful than orson so they re filmed half of it got a ruthless tv editor to chop it up and down down to minutes and hey presto comedy tonight a lesson there in when bad films turn good by lightening up i guess the fluffer stiffed on release and after seeing it not perform i can understand why
put the blame on executive producer wes craven and financiers the weinsteins for this big budget debacle a thrash metal updating of dracula with a condescending verbal jab at bram stoker who probably wouldn t want his name on this thing anyway and nothing much for the rest of us except slasher styled jolts and gore christopher plummer looks winded as van helsing in the modern day not just a descendant of van helsing but the real thing he keeps himself going with leeches obtained from count dracula s corpse which is exhumed from its coffin after being stolen from van helsing s vault and flown to new orleans this is just what new orleans needs in the st century the film well produced but without a single original idea except for multi racial victims is both repulsive and lazy and after about an hour starts repeating itself from
it s here finally a movie comes out that i can honestly say is worse than larry the cable guy health inspector yet i m willing to bet the the wayan s brothers hilarious will make more money than i ever make in my whole life on what is sure to be one of the top five worst films of all time outside of my fifth grade outside the class re enactment of romeo and juliet i mean really why would anyone ever ever see this movie unless they were paid to the comedy is weak and all even remotely funny jokes from the flimsy plot were surely revealed in commercials final word is this movie was a terrible letdown for me and the commercials looked so promising
jared diamond made a point in the first episode that other peoples of the world didn t have animals to domesticate but europeans did and that accounts for why we were able to make steel and invent complex machines but then in the third episode he says that when the europeans in south africa got too far north they ran into zulu people and other tribes that herded cattle and planted crops so what explains their lack of technological economic and artistic achievement if they had the key things the author claims are needed for success diamond also claims germs in the form of smallpox brought to north america by black slaves were our biggest weapon well if europeans can defeat native warriors and non military south africans can defeat zulus without a single casualty in either case then i think you have to conclude that germs are irrelevant with or without germs we were going to succeed he says malaria stopped europeans from colonizing further north killing thousands of europeans while not affecting africans i d like to know real numbers but he doesn t say then at the end he says today malaria is killing thousands of africans and that is why they can t catch up with us so which is it jared did malaria help the africans by halting eurpeans or hurt them and how come europe did okay despite massive plagues throughout our history he also seems far too eager to say that the reasons europeans succeeded was because of dumb luck at times when the evidence threatens to overwhelm his rickety theories he s reluctant to admit that maybe europeans were successful because they worked for it it s sad watch this obvious neo marxist contort reality to try to prove his point
where to begin how best to describe just how awful this movie is let s start with the campy hick humor it isn t very funny add a bunch of musicians impersonating actors meat loaf is horrible and deborah harry is even worse pity poor art carney who should have known better than to do this movie and then there is the plot a roadie whose life goal is to work an alice cooper show meets a girl whose life goal is to be a groupie for alice cooper at least they get what they want and then just when the movie should end they can t come up with a more plausible last scene than a well i won t ruin it for you if you really want to see the movie there are certain actors that let you know that this is going to be a b movie or perhaps worse gailard sartain is one of them for me and he has a more prominent role that s a sure sign that the movie probably won t be very good if nothing else the movie lives up to the low expectations even exceeds them by being worse than poor let s just say this this is the movie against which all bad movies are compared and none are worse than roadie
probable reasons why so many people on this site have enjoyed this they might not have read the book they might enjoy gore and violence in a film they might be very young and therefore not understand the violence people might not understand how somehow more scary and more violent it is compared to the original book there are sure to be many other reasons not covered here the only thing i liked about this film is the song bright eyes if perchance you happen to be one of those people who has read the book enjoys calm and peaceful films without violence and are quite old and understand scariness and violence you are sure not to like this otherwise you will almost definitely enjoy this like in the book a rabbit called fiver in an unsuspecting warren warns of terrible danger to come only a few rabbits including his brother hazel believe him and they set out on a dangerous journey to find a new place to live
feh this movie started out in an interesting manner but quickly ran the gamut from confusing to dull the confusing parts happened mostly at the beginning where the cut scenes are so numerous that its hard to tell just what is going on for the first twenty minutes or so the dull comes later with a tepid romance between the two living people pusses both the vengeful spirit of the dead girl is actually the most lively person in the film which is sad if the rest of the cast had been up to her caliber the movie might have been better maybe because the storyline gets really interesting for awhile as it appears that the insane priestess mother of the dead sixteen year old girl is trying to resurrect her daughter from the dead with the decidedly unfortunate side effect that all of the other dead people would come back as well take on solid human form and most likely start killing off everybody a sort of japanese mystical night of the living dead type thing but this doesn t come to pass even though this hairy unwashed priest with a tiny basket strapped to his head tells the uninteresting young people that this will come to pass if the priestess finishes her ritual she does just that and the only dead person who manifests is her daughter no mass rising of the dead no walking army of corpses nothing the priest merely makes the girl s spirit go back to the land of the dead taking the washed out wuss of a boyfriend with her as she d crushed his spine like peanut brittle at which point i was tempted to cheer loudly as this idiot went over to kiss and fondle the dead girl ewwww the robitussen sucking spineless best friend has a long introspective shot at the end as she leaves the village for the last time and that s it no real horror no real creepiness which the japanese tend to do far better than american film makers with their emphasis on over the top cheesy face make up no screaming mimis i was very disappointed
i saw this movie years ago and i was impressed but then again i was only years old i recently re watched it and want that time back this film is pretty bad while i like lee majors chris makepeace watch my bodyguard if you would like to see a good movie that he was in of meatballs also starring bill murray for some laughs and burgess meredith this role does did nothing for their careers anyway lee majors character franklyn hart is an ex race car driver who plans on driving his race car which he had in storage across the country to california one problem the government has outlawed all private transportation i thought the concept was ok not the worse i ve heard of but the execution failed horribly
mann photographs the alberta rocky mountains in a superb fashion and jimmy stewart and walter brennan give enjoyable performances as they always seem to do but come on hollywood a mountie telling the people of dawson city yukon to elect themselves a marshal yes a marshal and to enforce the law themselves then gunfighters battling it out on the streets for control of the town nothing even remotely resembling that happened on the canadian side of the border during the klondike gold rush mr mann and company appear to have mistaken dawson city for deadwood the canadian north for the american wild west canadian viewers be prepared for a reefer madness type of enjoyable howl with this ludicrous plot or to shake your head in disgust
this movie was awful the ending was absolutely horrible there was no plot to the movie whatsoever the only thing that was decent about the movie was the acting done by robert duvall and james earl jones their performances were excellent the only problem was that the movie did not do their acting performances any justice if the script would have come close to capturing a halfway decent story it would be worth watching instead robert duvall s and james earl jones performances are completely wasted on a god awful storyline or lack thereof not only was i left waiting throughout the movie for something to happen to make the movie well an actual movie not just utterless dialog between characters for what ended up being absolutely no reason it was nothing more than common dialog that would have taken place back in that period of time there was nothing special about any of the characters the only thing special was how robert duvall portrayed a rambling senile drunk old man nothing worthy happens during the entire movie including the end when the movie ended i sat amazed amazed that i sat through the entire movie waiting for something of interest to happen to make watching the movie worth while it never happened the cast of characters suddenly started rolling making it apparent that the movie really was over and i realized that i had just wasted hours of my life watching a movie with absolutely no plot and no meaning it wasn t even a story the entire movie takes place in a day s worth of time that s it it was one day in the life and death of some southerners on a plantation how much of a story can take place in a single day other than the movie training day the acting performances by the entire cast were excellent but they were grossly wasted on such a disappointment of a movie if you can even call it a movie
i really liked zb really i did i have no problem with extremely low budget movies and i have enjoyed movies with worse production values than zb if you can imagine such a thing check out wiseguys vs zombies if you re interested indeed i prefer lower budget zombie films because i am suspicious that hollywood directors do not understand what zombies are about but zb was just so bad it was retarded i don t want to bother being dignified in my criticism i want my minutes back etc except that it really only took minutes because partway through i put it into x fast forward okay here s some criticism the pacing was terrible everyone talked in monologues even when someone just had a single line the camera work and the editing and the insertion of a bunch of f bombs into every sentence made the line feel like a monologue at first i was excited about the minute running time compared to zb s minutes but there were actually fewer events in zb it s all talking the gore effects got stupider just glop rubbed around on people s tummies despite the epic exposition there really wasn t a plot and the exposition is indeed epic i won t spoil it if you re going to watch it don t watch it but then it s just a bunch of lame characters walking around and bickering for minutes or fewer if you so choose
this movie wasn t just bad it was terrible after i watched it i actually felt the need to take a shower to get the filth off of me there is running gag with an elderly couple making out it is not funny but it is disgusting the monster make up was cool but that is all the continuity errors alone will have you angry at least i was the editing is really poor almost anything else you could possibly do would be better than spending time watching this movie even if your group of friends are into bad movies this one is exceptional in its ineptitude i couldn t even bring myself to laugh at it you have been warned
that seem to be fooling people into seeing qualities in this film that are just not there near dark covered the same territory but with much more class and action why the script kept their big secret so long was a total mystery to me i guessed it at the breakfast scene at the start of the film by the time it was revealed to the viewer it was just a case of big deal tell me something i don t know i found this to be pointless movie that may have challenged the genre conventions unfortunately those conventions are that horror films are tense and packed with genuine sense of horror this was woeful
film critics of the world i apologize it is your job to give advice to the moviegoing public so that they can wisely choose what to spend money on but i ignored your advice and i have been deeply hurt however my decision to see the cat in the hat wasn t made haphazardly you see three years ago all of you critics said that we should all avoid the calamity known as how the grinch stole christmas then some friends of mine took me to see it and it turned out to be a colorful funny and almost hypnotic yuletide treat so when the critics unleashed their fury against the cat in the hat another big budget seuss update with a big name star in the title role i thought that it must be the same old song how wrong i was for five whole minutes i thought i was in the clear the opening credits are clever the kids are charming and the production values are top notch then the cat showed up there are many problems from this point on but the biggest one was the woeful miscasting of mike myers where the grinch was saved by the inspired casting of jim carrey the cat was destroyed by myers he can be very funny when his energies are applied where they belong comic sketches every movie he s made that was truly funny was really just a feature length comedy sketch from wayne s world to austin powers so he tries to do the same thing here it s just that these comedy sketches are more like the stuff that they stick at the end of snl not funny just painful not that the writers helped him out any after the charming prologue the movie turns into an hour of repulsive bodily humor gags poorly timed pratfalls and insultingly stunted attempts at hip humor this movie was the most disheartening cinematic experience i have ever had period so much talent and work went into something so vile i know that the adult stars of this movie will be relatively unscathed by this mess i just hope that the wonderful spencer breslin and dakota fanning will get more chances to show their charms in far better movies if you are a parent please avoid this like the plague with movies like elf and brother bear currently in theaters you have far better choices
karl jr and his dad are now running an army on a remote island they capture a trio of guys who stumble upon the island whom after a while fight back well the survivors this one has non stop blood gore and carnage which would have been good if any of it looked remotely real or if the production didn t look like it was made with a weeks worth of saved up lunch money i may be overexxagerating there it was probably just a couple days worth the horrendous dubbing didn t bother me as much and i suspect if i had been really drunk some of it might have been slightly humorous maybe but as it is at merely minutes the movie still felt way too long by oh i don t know minutes don t waste your time my grade f dvd extras bonus movie zombie extreme pestilence and trailers for other shock o rama released films
to me this just comes off as a soap opera i guess any depiction of profligate people can be considered social commentary but in the final analysis i simply don t care how you characterize this film none of the characters are very likable or engaging i felt no chemistry between hudson and bacall if there is a love story here it is lost in the malaise and despite the twist ending provided by a complete and immediate and therefore incomprehensible reversal by dorothy maguire on the witness stand the story is insufficient to hold my interest no matter how much freudian symbolism and psychology are throw in this story is sleazy melodramatic and trite rock hudson is nobly wooden this is lauren bacall s least engaging role and one of her poorest performances dorothy maguire and robert stack deliver more inspired performances but her character is vile and his is pathetic robert keith as the loving out of touch father of two miscreant adult children is the most sympathetic character most interesting of all however is the severe looking robert wilke in a small role as the bar owner he is best remembered as a nasty henchman in countless westerns but here he is an honest likable fellow i take my social commentary with an interesting engaging story and a few likable characters thank you
this movie was terrible at first i just read the plot summary and it looked ok so i watched it the acting was terrible it was like the actor were almost camera shy everything seemed fake i feel bad for edward furlong terminator was my favorite a few years ago i ve watched it at least times the plot was also crap the writers were probably sleep deprived when they came up with the lines on the plus side it s the good kind of bad movie the one you keep watching just to see how much worst could it will get so that later you can tell other people how you couldn t believe how terrible the movie was i think everybody should watch this so that then we could appreciate better other real movies
it s sort of hard for me to say it because i so greatly enjoyed both targets and paper moon but i thought the last picture show was a somewhat fascinating but overly self indulgent film its main positive as far as i m concerned is the stunning photography but for me the film had nothing to offer beyond surface beauty and a kind of hidden beauty at that the characters were very hard to relate to or to care about basically you had this very slow pace and this naturalistic style of acting but it was all there to prop up a very formulaic and predictable story complete with all the trappings one would expect from any small town melodrama everything from the boy cheating with his teacher s wife to the handicapped kid who everyone picks on it was like american graffiti without the joy of life some might say this film is more realistic nowadays a lot of people seem to think that realism is the only virtue a film can possess but for me the film was simply oppressive and i want to see it again about as badly as i d like to spend a few hours in that miserable town the characters live in maybe this film really just belongs to its time perhaps if i d seen it in i would have been impressed by its novelty just by seeing something different on the screen but that would basically assume that i had never seen anything like say godard s breathless maybe the overt references to classic films would have appealed to the movie geek in me and helped me to overlook some of the film s weaknesses but in the post tarantino world that hardly seems unique or special either it is interesting though how he uses the films in the film to give his own film more depth we see films as i recall in the picture show first we see vincente minnelli s father of the bride liz taylor s exquisite looks provide a contrast to sonny s girlfriend and minnelli s studied upper middle class milieu contrasts to the character s real life surroundings in a similar way later clips from howard hawks red river emphasize the theme of a broken friendship between a mentor and a prot g it really just reminds me that bogdanovich is kissing his own mentor s butt much as he did if i remember correctly by selecting a hawks film as part of his own on screen reverie with boris karloff in targets i guess in this kind of thing was new but looking at it today it just seems self indulgent like so much of the rest of this film ultimately i d rather see another film by hawks ford or minnelli than to have bogdanovich s film remind us of why they were so striking in such a less than subtle way maybe he intends to remind us of the giants whose time had passed all he really does is remind us how small he and most of his contemporaries are in relation
they made me watch this in school and it was terrible the movie is outdated the episodes become confusing because fact is combined with fiction to make the story more interesting the teachers talked about it as a treat but really it was a painfully boring experience i have read that very few people who appear in this are actors but most of them them do what they do in the movie in real life this accounts for cheesy acting very often also very often the story becomes mildly outrageous and far fetched i don t like the way some of the lines were written and wish they had more meaning to them though it was written to be educational funny suspenseful and hip it ended up being boring dry far fetched and old i hope no one takes time to watch this movie because you would be just fine not seeing it
i heard this film was much more stylistic than the films director guy ritchie lock stock and two smoking barrels snatch had directed before the problem is it is possibly too stylistic basically jake green jason statham is released from prison after seven years in solitary and within two years he gambles loads of his money he is ready to seek revenge against the violence prone casino owner who got jake sent to prison dorothy mr d macha ray liotta in the process doctors tell jake that he has three days left to live as he is dying from a rare blood disease oh and macha puts hit men on him loan sharks zach vincent pastore and avi andr benjamin are demanding jake pays their cash back and do some odd jobs for them the film is filled with jake narrating through some flashbacks and through his last three days before coming to the big revelation about zach and avi and macha well i assume that s what it was also starring terence maynard as french paul andrew howard as billy mark strong as sorter francesca annis as lily walker anjela lauren smith as doreen and elana binysh as rachel the are sequences involving a little bit of animation repeating lines twice in different perspectives and changing speeds for moments and all of these are irritating to the point of confusion and boredom making it a silly crime drama pretty poor
whatever rating i give boom is only because of the superb location photography of sardinia and rome otherwise this is only for hardcore addicts of elizabeth taylor her downward phase and richard burton his miscasting phase tennessee williams wrote the milk train doesn t stop here anymore and is supposed to be very fond of this adaptation of his play but apparently he was the only one taylor reportedly hated it and burton needed the money whatever it amounts to a hill of beans with taylor posturing and fuming in her shrill manner exploding at the servants and exchanging bad baby talk with no less than noel coward who seems to be a visitor from another film when he finally appears it s so campy that among taylor fans it s probably considered a must see kind of thing but if you can sit through this one without a drink in your hand you re way ahead of me sadly this is the film that signified the end of taylor being taken seriously as a film actress even after winning two oscars for burton it was equally disastrous and the critics called it a bomb judge for yourself if you dare
i knew nothing of this film before i was convinced to see it by a friend who had heard it was a non stop epic battle scene from beginning to end that couldn t have been further from the truth this was one of the most boring poorly written amateurishly directed horribly acted films i ve ever had the misfortune to lay my eyes upon i d rank it up there with the movie i consider to be the worst film of all time battlefield earth there basically is no story it s hard to believe that the makers of this film thought that this cheesy soap opera crap would be taken seriously as actual historic fact it also features some of the worst dialogue i ve ever heard like this little gem guy tells girl you smell like the moon girl replies what does the moon smell like omg you have to be kidding me the scene where the guy was drawn and quartered got some good laughs from the audience since it looked so ridiculously cheap and the sound fx of the guy being ripped apart reminded me of someone making a fart sound with their mouth if this is playing at a theater near you avoid it at all costs this movie is so bad that i actually made the decision about minutes through that i needed to catch up on my sleep and i did awful
i don t see enough tv game shows to understand the attraction of show me the money but i suppose it holds some appeal for undemanding audiences ostensibly a quiz show it offers contestants huge sums of money for answering a few simple questions however its quiz elements play only a small part in the proceedings which i find tortuously complicated for example before answering a question a contestant selects which question is to be asked by choosing from among random a b or c choices does this serve any purpose other than to slow the game down it would be a lot quicker simply to start with a contestants can pass on questions but must answer one of the three questions in each category after responding to a question the contestant is then asked to lock in the answer another delaying tactic the contestant s next task is to name which woman from about a dozen go go dancers in cages is to unveil a card that indicates how much the question is worth a correct answer adds the card s dollar figure to the contestant s running total a wrong answer subtracts the same sum this time consuming step actually has some entertainment value as it allows the audience to get a close look at the scantily clad and uniformly gorgeous dancers meanwhile the contestant is reminded that an unlucky selection of the killer card will end the game instantly this naturally makes the contestant sweat and causes further delays as the nervous contestant contemplates the sudden loss of the hundreds of thousands of dollars my suspicion is that the possibility of sudden disaster is the show s chief audience appeal meanwhile the whole process is slowed down even more by a lot of empty banter between host william shatner and the contestant along with occasional routines by the caged dancers all these delays burn up so much time that it might be possible for audiences to forget what the original question is by the time the correct answer is revealed a typical minute episode of jeopardy often gets through as many as questions the first minutes of smtm that i watched got through only six questions many of which pertained to other tv shows no one in his right mind would watch this show because it s fun to play along by answering the questions at home that leaves three possible reasons to watch the show a to see how a contestant responds to being on the verge of winning as much as one million dollars only to lose everything in one stroke b to look at gorgeous young women performing sexually suggestive dance routines c to enjoy william shatner s scintillating banter my choice is b but the women aren t on camera long enough to justify suffering through an hour of this show
i have rarely been subjected to such outright nonsense in a film that is supposed to be based on a historical figure a horrible joke of a film i cringed throughout terrible trite distorted and riddled with outright lies and half truths the famous hitler biographer ian kershaw was to originally be a consultant for this film however he found the script to be so historically inaccurate and ridiculous that he refused and also demanded they stop using his name as a source it embarrassed him to think people would think he was involved one scene shows hitler beating his dog there is not one source for this hitler loved animals above people he brought in the strictest animal welfare laws in europe banned vivisection and animal experimentation he was also a vegetarian the film turns his gaining of the iron cross into a farce involving bribery utter lies he was awarded it for repeated acts of bravery over a long period of time there are no historical documents showing that hitler ever had a sexual relationship with his niece not one apart from these hitler is portrayed as a rabid simpleton in this garbage flick if he was even half as ignorant demented and thick as he is in this nonsense film as in real life you would not even know he had ever existed never mind become the leader of germany honestly this film was utterly terrible go watch downfall and give this a very wide berth
i m not a big fan of rom coms at the best of times a few have been quite good check of dream for an insomniac but this one is just more of the same but less with a running time of min i expect more than laugh every mins the only real belly laugh are when male strangers and friends instinctivly help out lee s character all i can say is avoid i gaurentee there is at least other movies on the shelf that deserve you of out and only cos i m a big lee fan
absolutely one of the worst movies i have ever seen the acting the dialog the manuscript the sound the lighting the plot line i actually can t say anything positive about this although i enjoy swedish movies the fighting scenes are so ridiculous that it s impossible to take it seriously and when the lead character just happens to loose his shirt while dodging bullets in a strip bar i m not sure if it s supposed to be a joke or if someone really thinks these are ingredients in a good film regina lund is the only half descent actor but she disappears in a flood of laughable pronunciations and unbelievable reactions it leaves you horrified that someone actually spent time and money on something like this
in some ways the concept behind the storyline was a rather interesting blend of several typical movie types in an interesting combination however no point in this movie was so obvious that it did not deserve lingering close up shots i felt as though i had been beat over the head with the so called mysterious explanation for the disease killing people the writer appears to have simply lifted clich s from other movies as a substitute for writing lines adapted to actual characters the actors did not help matters no chemistry i guess they were supposed to develop some kind of attraction if only for the reason that such is an essential element of these stories however the writers didn t work very hard to develop the chemistry sure they re both attractive but whether they re attractive to each other seemed to be an open question the confidence turner s character shows in sabato s developed far too quickly and for no particular reason sabato s character is supposed to be a discredited doctor who just can t seem to play by the rules think of the jeff goldblum character in independence day usually that kind of character is supposed to demonstrate some kind of talent or brilliance sabato s character does not he s cassandra with just the crazy and all the prophetic skills of a magic eight ball he appears to be right by random chance the death scenes are comical every actor was really trying more than a little to hard to demonstrate the agony inflicted on them the symptoms looked like bad claymation sort of like that video from the s peter gabriel i think
this is an abysmal piece of story telling it is about an hour into the movie before we have much idea of what it is supposed to be about the characters often mumble inaudibly actions frequently seem to have no relation to each other nobody seems to be concerned about who actually murdered the girl a pair of spooky kids go swimming in waters that seem threatening but nothing happens the irishman gets punched in the face by one of his buddies for no apparent reason to continue would be as boring as the movie itself the only half entertaining element is the landscape photography but anyone could point a camera at the australian outback a get memorable shots overall dreary incoherent pretentious and downright annoying for wasting so much of the viewer s time

although robert knox benfer has his fans i m not one of them his films are asinine and amateurish and and just not very funny unless you re a year old with an underdeveloped sense of humor he s certainly not famous as him immature fans would like you to believe by harassing people at wikipedia or stuffing the ratings votes here at the imdb he s certainly not been profiled by any major media outlets which speaks volumes about his and his creation s fame benfer does have some slight skill at limited animation but he needs to get away from his young sycophants and learn to write some actual funny material before he ll be taken seriously as a real entertainer as of this moment though he s just a kid with a camera and it shows
if i could say it was better than gymkata i at least felt my money was not totally wasted then i saw steven segal s on deadly ground this movie should see a resurrection though on mst k if santa claus conquers the martians could make tom servo s head explode one wonders what mayhem this movie could cause there is a very good reason why kurt thomas never had a movie career the writers of this dreck should be forced to wear placards every day of their lives that say bitch slap me i was a writer on gymkata
why is it that a woman cannot be a strong character in a movie without sleeping with the leading man the campaign manager in this movie dreams of leading tom sellick to the white house it s all she can think about so why on earth must she have had an affair with him it added nothing to the plot and served only to demean successful women the only value of that tidbit was the cute we ve all slept with your husband scene also couldn t the people who made this movie have watched the national conventions they were spoofing airing between the two major political conventions only served to highlight their total ignorance of the nomination and selection process
saw this movie in my english class this afternoon and was surprised by how bad this version was don t get me wrong george c scott was terrific as scrooge but the rest of the cast fails so very badly sometimes i couldn t stop laughing at the stupid acting and the repeated line merry christmas to everyone other times i almost fell asleep the movie is based on a charles dickens short story about a rich guy who don t think christmas is nothing but humbug after minutes the rich guy is visited by three ghosts who persuade him to celebrate christmas after all i can not understand how this movie with a script so bad it must have been written in five minutes can be so well rated instead of this piece of garbage i recommend to you the bill murray comedy scrooged that at least was funny
i only watched this film from beginning to end because i promised a friend i would it lacks even unintentional entertainment value that many bad films have it may be the worst film i have ever seen i m surprised a distributor put their name on it
not to be confused with the madonna film the next best thing the last big thing is a silly campy off the wall comedy about a man who yearns to start a magazine called the next big thing which reviews a variety of up and coming artists this low budget indie makes chuck and buck look like a masterpiece fraught with lousy acting poor sets and costuming etc thing has earned some awful reviews and to date has only been nominated for one fringe award pass on this one
with its companion piece masters of horror nightmares and dreamscapes can only be seen as the absolute nadir of the genre that began so auspiciously with the twilight zone and the outer limits of course part of the problem is that it does nothing to be of any interest to a comparatively adult audience instead aiming at ten year olds who are only able to count body bags and scarcely that and so grossness is king and king is grossness stephen king is simply illiterate in general he has the aptitude for storytelling of bart simpson since he cannot read his sole inspiration is the movies true the cinema is not such a bad place to start since it has generally escaped the onslaught of realism but these films are only the rumor not the thing and if you want to write you have to dig deeper of course only pickman had monsters as close acquaintances but even so it should be clear to any undergraduate that vampires are not dracula and lugosi at least autopsy room four is a clear indication of what is wrong one can almost imagine this pathetic dolt sitting as his desk trying to come up with something scary not mind you trying to describe accurately the horror of the system of which he is an integral part making the stupid stupider but trying to come up with a scary story for his little nephew suppose you were paralyzed and people thought you were dead and started to cut you open like they do at those autopsy things wouldn t that be gross and that boys and girls is the story what about characterization oh yes he s one of these suits who never really appreciated life you know and now it s too late right and he s shouting well they can t actually hear him you know he s saying that he s going to sue the hospital but he s not such a big shot anymore you see lying there or is it laying i can never remember and all and he s thinking oh no please please don t cut me and this is terrible lying or laying like that now wouldn t that be a great story you know i read somewhere that a snake bite can do that i think it was that great medical authority agatha christie what was the name of that snake again oh yeah a boomslang has quite a ring to it doesn t it let s make it a peruvian boomslang sure steve that s great except that boomslang is afrikaans you moron but how can you really tell that the target audience is children and not simply mental defects it s easy there s no sex well there is but it s the kind glimpsed through a crack in the door to our parent s bedroom modern filmmakers are really big on the erotic aspects of the genre the monster the female victim the chase but unlike universal and lewton they have no idea what s going on all that s really left is the giggling outside the sm club and the fascist credo that people with sexual preferences are intrinsically evil in spite of a certain discrepancy in size king kong knew exactly what to do with fay wray freddy krueger can only kill her and since there s no real titillation in that he has to torture her first not in any way that might excite her you understand since that would upset our puritan sentiments and so horror and romanticism become simply unpleasantness and the grooming of psychopaths our hero you see is a rubber fetishist and can only get a boner if someone touches him you know down there with you know rubber gloves giggle and that s what they use in autopsies and that s how they discover that he is in fact you know obviously this is the author at the height of his inspirational powers too bad they cut it out since it might have upset the five year olds watching the show
what was steven seagal thinking i mean firstly i love seagal i love all his movies up to the mid s his early stuff is some of the best in the genre this however does not live up to its excellent name attack force with protagonist marshall lawson seagal would be expected to be a mindless action movie with seagal in typical one liner ass kicking form however what we get is a crime mystery bordering on a political thriller with little or no action seagal is always in shadows because of his weight i could not follow this story there s people who mutate to superhumans when they take a drug what happened in this movie the dubbing of seagal is a disgrace a shambles and a shame why dub the man the story is terrible this got a from me because of the scene where seagal asks for backup despite having an army with him and an hilarious fight scene where seagal swings his hands like a girl facing the camera revenge is a two way street seagal says in this movie well forget revenge steven you need redemption
a young basketball playing professor of genetics is doing research on the genetic sequence using human fetuses he hopes to be able to find a cure for all diseases and aging he s pressured into concluding his research because he hasn t published so the university is having trouble justifying funding him i think he does a trial injection on a monkey which quickly dies he then tries it on himself he starts a relationship with the single mother of an extremely annoying little boy she s the one who had been demanding results from the research initially he seems to have no effects from the injection except some new strength he then realizes that he had some memory loss and starts recalling what happened additionally he starts to appear very unhealthy since the movie is named metamorphosis he does eventually change into something else you won t believe your eyes either what he turned into or the absolutely crappy costume the actor is wearing to depict what he s turned into incredibly there s a further change in store the end of the movie is really really absurd about the only thing this movie has going for it is that laura gemser is in it but she has a very small part i d once seen a the video box for this with a sculpted plastic form glued to the boxcover possibly it might even have had some electronics in it at one time perhaps eyes that light up the main character s eyes occasionally turn green in the movie the copy i watched had a box that only showed tear marks where the glue had held on the plastic which had been removed the novelty boxcover if it still had it would have been the only reason i would have held onto this movie i m definitely getting rid of it
back in his youth the old man had wanted to marry his first cousin but his family forbid it many decades later the old man has raised three children two boys and one girl and allows his son and daughter to marry and have children soon the sister is bored with brother and jumps in the bed of brother one might think that the three siblings are stuck somewhere on a remote island but no they are upper class europeans going to college and busy in the social world never do we see a flirtatious moment between any non related female and the two brothers never do we see any flirtatious moment between any non related male and the one sister all flirtatious moments are shared between only between the brothers and sister the weakest part of gladiator was the incest thing the young emperor commodus would have hundreds of slave girls and a city full of marriage minded girls all over him but no he only wanted his sister if movie incest is your cup of tea then sunshine will slowly thrill you to no end
i usually talk a bit about the plot in the first part of my review but in this film there s really not much to talk of just a mish mash of other far better sword sorcery epics lack of cohesiveness runs rampant as does banality even the main villaness refusing to wear clothing other then a loincloth is pretty boring as she pretty much has a chest of a young boy mildly amusing in it s ineptitude at best and severely retarded at it s worst lucio fulci was scrapping the bottom of the barrel here and it shows my grade d dvd extras posters stills galleries lucio fulci bio and us international theatrical trailers eye candy sabrina siani is topless throughout some may consider that appealing i did not various extras are topless as well
wow this film was just bloody horrid so bad in fact that even though i didn t pay to see it i still wanted my money back the film is about nothing intelligible it s a mish mash of sci fi cliche s that were done better by much more skilled film makers the performances especially by the leads were over the top in a less endearing ed wood sort of way speaking of ed wood he d be proud of the character s dialogue it s just too taciturn with no hint of irony or sense of humor on top of that it doesn t make sense nor does the plot or lackthereof the visual effects are okay but not enough to go oh wow that s cool and they just seem to be thrown in to be cool rather than be a good plot device the soundtrack was another mishmash of stuff that really never set any sort of mood again it seemed as if the director was just throwing in songs in the film in an effort to be cool which brings me to my final point perhaps if the director actually worried more about plot story and dialogue instead of trying to be cool he wouldn t have made such a dorky cliche of a short film
this is the worst movie i have ever seen in my entire life the plot and message are horrible there are too many mistakes in this movie that it s impossible to keep up i don t even understand how this movie can get any nomination let alone here s why sam lee portrays a angry irrational detective which was caused by the disappointment from his dad pros he s angry alright cons when it comes to the explanation scene he cannot convey the sadness disappointment he has in his father the crying scene was too fake and it seems like he is literally squeezing out tears from the corner of his eyes to connect the movie to the title there were barking or dog wimping sounds during the fight scenes and rape scene which is totally irrelevant and confusing to the viewer i understand that it s supposed to be a metaphor or what not but it s just sooo dumb why the heck did the cops not shoot the killer what the heck is wrong with this movie when the killer started stabbing an officer shoot him he s already dead what the heck there were lots of opportunity that the killer could be killed but i do not know why he wasn t during the scene where the girl had her foot hurt in the scene it was very clear that the left foot of the girls was hurt so how the heck in the next scene that she s lending all her weight on her left foot and this is the actress nominated as the best new performer wtf the sounds in the movie are off sync i am guessing that this movie is trying to bring awareness of the brutality and violence among children in south east asia so why does the bad guy wins and then the cop was joining the fight this movie is just too violent without a purpose cops are beating ci to a pulp and then if they cooperate they give them marijuana and coke this is overall the worst movie i truly feel that the person who wrote this movie is a sadist and sick person i have never seen a more disgusting movie in my whole entire life worst movie ever
as someone who has both read the novel and seen the film i have a different take on why the film was such a flop first any comparisons between novel and film are purely superficial they are two different animals the novel is probably intended as a satire but it arrives as a cross between tragedy and polemic instead any comedic elements such as those which later formed the stylistic basis of the film version are merely incidental to the author s uniformly cynical thrust and lest the omnipresent white suit of the author fool you into thinking this is another mark twain think again a more apt literary precedent would be the spectre of ambrose bierce in a top hat and tails tom wolfe is equal parts clown and hack more celebrity than author always looking for new grist for his self absorbed mill it is therefore no wonder that the excellent production skills and direction lavished on the making of the film were doomed from the start unlike true satire which translates very well into film polemics are grounded not in universally accessible observations on some form or other of human behavior but in a single minded attack on specific people whether real or fictional straw men who have somehow earned the wrath of the writer any effort to create a successful filmed story or narrative from such a beginning must have a clean start free of the writer s influence or interference having said that i too find fault with the casting it is not merely that incompetents like bruce willis and melanie griffith fail to measure up but that real talents like tom hanks f murray abraham and morgan freeman are either totally wasted or given roles that are mere caricatures there is enough topical material here for a truly great film satire but it fails to come even close
i knew i was going to see a low budget movie but i expected much more from an alex cox film the acting by the two leading men was terrible especially the white guy the girl should have won an oscar compared to those two this movie was filled with what i guess would be inside jokes for film industry people and a few other jokes that i actually understood and made me laugh out loud which is rare without these laugh out loud moments i would have given this film what happened to the alex cox who made all the s classics spoiler there were a couple of questions i had after the movie was over why did the mexican guy go to the other guy s house at the beginning what did his daughter say he got people fired from his last job why was she breaking her own stuff when she was mad at him i guess i should have gone to the q a after the movie but i didn t want to get up at am
my boyfriend and i rented this because we thought it might be a good halloween take off a killer terrorizing young people a white mask you get my drift we were dead wrong no pun intended we not only discovered one of the worst movies out there but also that it is a cult classic it is filled w plot holes and makes no sense the actress who plays maddy is pretty but that s about it i do give credit for it being shot on a very low budget i always support movies like that just not this particular one this movie may be good to see if you re drunk or high otherwise don t bother unless you want to lose your movie privileges like i did
no i m not kidding if they ever propose a movie idea they should be kicked out of the studio i m serious their movies are exactly the same in every one and they only consist of traveling to foreign locations having a problem which they easily resolve hoping to be popular and getting new boyfriends think about it if you have ever seen a movie starring them with a different plot contact me and tell me its name these movies are poor excuses to be on tv and go to other countries there is a reason that the movies never go to theaters i m sure that when they were really young and made some o k movies some studio boss bought all their rights for years or something so that now that they re what they can make movies in other countries whenever they want using the studio s money let me advise you stay away from mary kate and ashley it s for your own good
i thought this was a sequel of some sorts and it is meant to be to the original from but a sequel is not taking the original plot and destroying it i actually had very little expectations to this movie but i just wasted minutes of life no suspense i actually feel clairvoyant poor acting and so filled with technical errors so i as a computer geek just couldn t believe it they have tried to make it a mix between a generic war movie and hours but this is not even worthy of a low budget tv movie do not see this movie this is a complete waste of time instead get the original the theme is still valid don t let to much power into a machine and the acting and plot is far more exiting and compelling
this bomb is just one explosion after another with no humor and only absurd situations really pyrotechnics to the extreme reality is not one of its strong points i give it a out of i would have made it a zero but that option wasn t permitted sorry but lithgow and sutherland deserve better roles but then at times we all need to have money and i still recoil at that tim burton farce about mars nicholson was brave enough to admit that was a turkey but if that was a turkey this movie then is not even a gizzard i wish i could say give me back my money you can bet i would if i could but that is the trouble with premium services the subscription variety
this film was the recipient of the academy award for best animated short film over the last few weeks i have seen dozens of the nominees and recipients of this award from the last years and i really think that this film might just be the worst of them all yet it wasn t just a nominee but it won i assume that must have just been a horrible year for the genre the film shows a group of characters that look a bit like super skinny uncle festers the appear to be simple articulated figures who are moved using stop motion animation all are identical with the same faces bodies and clothes the only difference is that each has a different number drawn on their backs they are all standing on a large platform that is suspended as if by magic in space each has a pole and their is also a box on the platform the platform begins tilting slightly and in response the men move about in an effort to balance the platform this goes on and on and on and on for the longest time the only relief from this tedium is when one of them acts rather nasty towards the end but it just isn t enough to make this fun to watch in the least aside from passable stop motion animation this short offers nothing of interest to me nothing by the way the great short knick knack also came out in and i have no idea why it was not among the nominees it was a great short and was far better than any of the nominees that year or the year before perhaps pixar s success in previous years resulted in a bias against them but knick knack is so clever and so funny it seems almost criminal to have ignored it could pixar have not entered it this seems unlikely
it s not my fault my girlfriend made me watch it there is nothing positive to say about this film there has been for many years an idea that madonna could act but she can t there has been an idea for years that guy ritchie is a great director but he is only middling an embarrassment all round
the little mermaid is one of my absolute favorite disney movies i m sorry to say however that disney completely messed up when they made this sequel i ll admit it has some good points to it the songs aren t bad and the animation is clean and clear there is some humor i m sure i don t remember because after watching it i immediately banned it from appearing before my eyes again the worst point of this movie is the plot in this movie ariel becomes her father she forbids her daughter to go near the sea yes out of fear just as she was forbidden to go near the land i personally think that given her past ariel would maintain some of her headstrong ways and not treat her daughter like she herself was treated besides this fact ursula was replaced by a non scary pathetic sort of sea witch the underfed forgotten sister who is more comical than scary she too has some little underling to do her bidding but she s not scarier or worse than ursula ursula spoiled us with her believability for badness this sea witch is a joke to make matters worse flounder is a fat deep voiced father no longer the cute guppy we all know and love and eric s voice is not even done by the same actor something that always annoys me in a remake sequel his voice difference was very obvious to me by the way i felt that the only reason this movie was made was so that disney could catch a few fast dollars something i hate to think about a corporation i actually really do enjoy i felt that this plot lacked imagination i know that this act child following in the footsteps of a parent happens but ariel was different that was what we loved so much about her she had a dream she fell in love and she made that dream come true until she appeared in this movie that is then she became just like the other adults this isn t the ariel i know and i don t like her i know of some children who have enjoyed this film and i know some adults who didn t mind it either but for me and for all of you out there who have the utmost love for ariel please don t see this movie the ariel we know dies within resurrected only for a song or two and one final scene that actually isn t bad where she accepts the water back again although she takes very little part in the ending regardless
first one was much better i had enjoyed it a lot this one has not even produced a smile the idea was showing how deep down can human kind fall but in reference to the characters not the film maker
although i had heard this film was a little dry i watch whatever scott bakula is in at the start of this film i had high hopes for the classic cheesy but enjoyable scott gets girl ending and until minutes before the end it was going great the plot twist was crazy and unexpected and very clever i kept my fingers crossed that it would work out and it would all be some horrible misunderstanding right up until when the credits rolled and i realised that there was not going to be a happy and contented ending unfortunately i was left regretting that i d watched it and hurriedly putting on some quantum leap to restore my faith in the goodness of the great scott
i haven t seen anything this bad since i walked out of the james bond movie moonraker twenty years ago i managed to sit through the entirety of this one only because of tilda swinton but there was nothing she could do to save this beast as a cross between pi orlando and tron this movie failed miserably in every aspect of moviemaking the characters were cardboard and unable to evoke any kind of sympathy the plot was wholly unbelievable the acting was with the exception of swinton amateur the computer graphics were worse than in tron timothy leary was extremely annoying i could go on but what s the point the only good thing i can say about this film is that tilda swinton was in it i have no idea why an actress of her caliber consented to appear in such a dud but she most likely regrets it now don t waste your money or your time on this stinker there s nothing worth seeing here
this book based movie is truly awful and a big disappointment we ve been waiting for this move over a month many film reviewer were hopeful for it also in newspapers and tv it made big sense when th april comes many people regretfully noticed that movie is really awful why first of all story was so monotone it has been many indefinite scenes sometimes it s hard to realize what s going on the actresses out of hulya avsar weren t harmonized with their roles especially vildan atasever she acts better in comedy films in this movie a kind of drama she couldn t disposed of her previous role and finally movie is too short just minutes
s i c k really stands for so incredibly crappy i killed myself there was absolutely no acting to speak of the best part of the whole production was the art work on the cover of the box the budgeting of this movie was sufficient the filming was sub sesame street the production looks like that of the underground filming for mob hits the props used in this movie were stolen from a clothing store the ending was so predictable you should fast forward to the last minutes and laugh if there is a book out there for this movie i m sure it s better i would avoid this at all costs i did enjoy the intimate scenes they made the whole movie worth it just kidding
this is the worst adaption of a classic story i have ever seen they needlessly modernize it and some points are actually just sick the songs rarely move along the story they seem to be thrown in at random the flying scene with marley is pointless and ludicrous it s not only one of the worst movies i ve seen but it is definitely the worst musical i ve ever seen it s probably only considered a classic because a christmas carol is such a classic story just because the original story was a classic doesn t mean that some cheap adaption is
well were to start this is by far one of the worst films i ve ever paid good money to see i won t comment on the story itself it s a wonderful classic but here it feels like a soap opera to start with the acting except for eric bana is soap opera quality i ve always been a fan of brad pitt but here every actor on the bold and the beautiful puts him to shame the camera action doesn t help either how it lingers on him when he s thinking it just takes me back to brooke forrester s days in the lab peter o toole has either had a really bad plastic surgery or he is desperately in need of one either way he looks more like linda evans than linda evans and to end my comments diane kruger is a cute girl but she sure is no helen of troy peterson should rather have chosen saffron burrows for the role since elizabeth taylor would be rather miscast by now
this is a simple tale but it feels very manipulative it lacks pathos for it does not leave a room for imagination or a personal thought or time for reflection the animation is well done but i feel like it is too presentational i would have preferred more images from behind more space in the background and maybe then this would not feel so kitsch to me but for a hollywood style film it works ok but it is very derivative of aardman films and this is bothering to me perhaps a longer film will test if this maker can do without the voice over i think the voice over is too glib
considering its popularity i found this movie a huge disappointment maybe i was expecting too much from this film after all it is one of the most well known martial arts films of the s but i could never figure out why the story is uninteresting it is also a very talky movie with sporadic action sequences my biggest problem with the movie was that the story does not offer a character that i could root for since the intended hero is an idiot director chang has no sense of style and he is unable to hide the glaring imperfections found in the narrative i know this is not supposed to be high art but i found the movie boring definitely not the best example of this much beloved genre its cult status escapes me i recommend you to skip it
when i go to see movies i would stay up and watch it or if i did not like it i would go sleep but this was pure crap i actually got up and walked out this was poorly script and put together i hated it also they should not have taken brendan frasier off he was much better this was not as good as i had expected considering that i really liked george of the jungle and the graphics weren t as good as the first one for instance the bird and when ever he crashed in a tree i hope that the director of this takes heed and next movies he make he needs to reconsider horrible i really would like to give ursla a job well done as she made the movie worthwhile until i walked out overall i give this movie a out of
a call girl witnesses a murder and becomes the killer s next target director brian de palma is really on a pretentious roll here his camera swoops around corners in a museum after lingering a long time over a painting of an ape divvies up into split screen for arty purposes practically gives away his plot with a sequence again in split screen where two characters are both watching a tv program about transsexuals and stages his first finale during a thunderous rainstorm dressed to kill is exhausting primarily because it asks us to swallow so much and gives back nothing substantial much of the acting with the exception of young keith gordon is mediocre and the second finale is a rip off of de palma s own carrie not to mention psycho the explanation of the dirty deeds plays like a spoof of hitchcock not an homage stylish in a steely cold way the end results are distinctly half baked from
this has got to be one of the worst fillums i ve ever seen and i ve seen a few it is slow boring amateurish not even consistent within its own simplistic reading of the plot the actors do not act i can t blame them they have been given a script of such utter banality all they can do is trudge through it with a pain behind their eyes which has nothing to do with the evil goings on in summersisle there is not one moment in this film that rings true not an honest line nor a single instant where one is moved the nicholas cage character is so badly drawn that one feels not a smidgeon of compassion for him through all his tribulations i have no doubt that i was seeing a suffering man up there but it was nicholas cage fully aware of the fact that he was in the worst movie of his entire career
i kinda liked the film despite it s frenzied pace but i did not appreciate the comment that canada was referred to as montana north it is definitely not montana north and never will be americans wonder why they are perceived as arrogant in the rest of the world and that is one reason why stop teaching the kids of the united states of america to think they own the planet such a centrist world view is not becoming of one of the world s great nations even in jest i would never refer to the usa as alberta south walt would never put us down so why start now other than that the film was pretty goofy better luck next time
basing a television series on a popular author s works is no guarantee of success yorkshire television learnt this the hard way when in they bought the rights to the books credited to dick francis three of which were broadcast under the collective title the racing game mike gwilym was sid halley a former jockey turned private eye following an accident in which he lost his right hand only to have it replaced by an artificial one gwilym suffered from an acute lack of charisma and looked like one of the bad guys while mick ford who played the irritating chico barnes made me think of a horse s arse whenever he was on screen for six weeks this less than dynamic duo charged about the countryside foiling nefarious plots to fix races usually by the same methods blackmail kidnapping riders or doping horses yorkshire television threw money at the show but to no avail violent sexist far fetched and repetitious it was quickly carted off to the knackers yard
i was excited to see a sitcom that would hopefully represent indian candians but i found this show to be not funny at all the producers and cast are probably happy to get both bad and good feed back because as far as they are concerned it s getting talked about i was ready for some stereotyping and have no problem with it because stereotypes exist for a reason they are usually true but there really wasn t anything funny about these stereotypical characters the fresh of the boat dad who doesn t understand his daughter the radical feminist muslim daughter who by the way is a terrible actress and the young modern indian man trying to run his mosque as politically correct as he can he s a pretty good actor i only see him getting better it is very contrived and the dialog doesn t flow that well there was so much potential for something like this but sadly i think it failed and don t really care to watch another episode i did however enjoy watching a great canadian actress sheila mccarthy again she s always a treat and a natural at everything she does too bad her daughter in the show doesn t have the same acting abilities
kill me later has an interesting initial premise a suicidal woman selma blair on the verge of jumping off the top of an office building is protects a bank robber max beesley who promises to kill her later the actual execution of this premise however falls flat as almost every action serves as a mere device to move the plot toward its predictable conclusion shoddily written characters who exhibit no motive for their behaviors compromise the quality of acting all around lack of character depth especially diminishes selma blair s performance whose character shawn vacillates from being morose to acting cool and ultimately comes across as a confused dolt this is unfortunate as under other circumstances ms blair is an appealing and capable actress compounding matters for the worse is director dana lustig s insistence on using rapid cuts incongruous special effects e g look for an unintentionally hilarious infrared motorcycle chase at the end and a hip soundtrack in the hopes of appealing to the short attention spans of the mtv crowd certainly ms lustig proves that she is able to master the technical side of direction but in no way does her skill help overcome the film s inherent problems and thus the movie drags on to the end clearly lustig has a distinct visual style however it is perhaps better suited to music videos than to feature film the producers ram bergman lustig can be commended for their ability to realize this film they were able to scare up million to finance the film secure a good cast and get domestic and foreign distribution this is no small feat for an independent film yet given the quality of the product the result is a mixed bag
this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen robin williams fit into the part like a rhino would fit into a tutu even so his performance was still pitiful kurt russell was more believable but still was awful the plot left much to be desired and the rest of the acting was also terrible the only thing this movie had going for it was the trailer which suckered me in to wasting minutes of my life which could have been better spent trying to lick the back of my head do yourself a favor and burn this movie if you have it if not just be happy you don t
hm while an enjoyable movie to poke plot holes point out atrocious acting primitive at best special effects all of which have caused me to view this movie three times over the past six years severed ranks among the worst i ve ever seen i m never sure who the protagonists are all i know is that the killer uses a portable guillotine as seen in the dance floor murder scene all in all i don t really like the movie because only the first minutes are enjoyable the rest is a mishmash of confusing dialog and imagery that fail to progress the story to a logical conclusion which i can t remember anyway
an expedition led by hunky captain storm mark dana travels to the valley of the kings in cairo to find out what happened to an earlier expedition they meet beautiful mysterious simira ziva rodann who joins them they soon find themselves faced with a blood drinking mummy and only simira seems to know what s going on a real snoozer i caught this on late night tv when i was about it put me to sleep seeing it again all these years later i can see why it s slow moving the mummy doesn t even show up until minutes in and this is only minutes long the acting ranges from bad dana to real bad george n neise and there s no violence or blood to be found this movie concentrates more on second rate dramatics involving a silly love triangle than horror this rates three stars because it actually looks pretty good everyone plays it straight there s some good acting from diane brewster it s short and the mummy attack scenes all three of them aren t bad they re not scary just mildly creepy still this movie is pretty bad a sure fire cure for insomnia
richard dix is a big not very nice industrialist who has nearly worked himself to death if he takes the vacation his doctors suggest for him can he find happiness for the last months of his life well he ll likely be better off if he disregards the voice of the whistler this william castle directed entry has some great moments the introduction and the depiction of richard dix s life through newsreel a la citizen kane and some intriguing plotting in the final reels dix s performance is generally pretty good but unfortunately the just does not quite work because one does not end up buying that the characters would behave the way that they do also the movie veers from a dark and fascinating beginning to an almost cheerful s movie like midsection full of nice urban ethnic types who don t mind that they aren t rich and back again to a complex noir plot for the last minutes or so this is a decent movie worth seeing but it needed a little more running time to establish a couple of the characters and a female lead capable of meeting the demands of her role
i read the book celestine prophecy and was looking forward to seeing the movie be advised that the movie is loosely based on the book many of the book s most interesting points do not even come out in the movie it is a b movie at best many events characters how the character interact and meet in the book are simply changed or do not occur the flow of events that in the book are very smooth are choppy and fed to the view as though you a child the character development is very poor personnallities of the characters differ from those in the book the direction is similar to a b horror flick i understand that it would take six hours in film to present all that is in the book but they screen play base missed many points the casting was very good
the guy who wrote directed and stared in this shocking piece of trash should really consider a carer change yes rob stefaniuk i mean you seriously who funded this crap there are so many talented writers out there whom money could be better spent on i think the idea is great but the acting script and directing is just plain awful the jokes are so not funny i understand that they are supposed to be taking the mickey but do it with style this movie is screaming saturday night live skits why i say again why do studios give money to hacks like rob stefaniuk never give a comedian the opportunity to write direct and star in his own movie duh
i m into bad movies but this has nothing going for it despite what the morons above have said it is not funny i know comedy and underground movies but this is so boring that the director writer should be prohibited from ever directing anything but local cable access ever again to love movies and comedy is to despise this film i may never get over how unfunny and boring this work was if you like this movie you are a pothead as sober there is nothing here zero if you need to compare underground movies see kentucky fried movie or early john waters the movie starts by defining satire and i defy anyone to show me the satire the rule for comedy is this if it s funny you can say or do anything but if it s not funny you are not satirical you are not edgy you are merely pathetic and this movie is simply not funny zero
this is probably one of the worst films i have ever seen the events in it are completely random and make little or no sense the fact that there is a sequel is so sickening i may come down with a case of cabin fever i m so sorry i describe it as bug being smooshed to a newspaper because it seems to be different parts of things mixed together e g kevin the pancake loving karate kid is just freakishly weird on its own then there s the cop who is slightly weird and perverted then the drug addict then there s the fact that they attack some random guy who clearly needs help then all of a sudden the main character is having sex with his friends girlfriend just because she says something stupid about a plane going down then at the end some good old family racism followed by a rabbit operating on kevin the karate kid its actually pretty despicable that they can use racism as a joke in this film there is no reason for anyone to enjoy this film unless you love eli roth even that did not make me like this film hate is a strong word but seeing as it is the only word i am permitted to use it will have to do boycott cabin fever
i never understood why some people dislike bollywood films they ve got charismatic actors great dance numbers and heightened emotion what s not to like what i didn t realize was that i had only seen the upper crust of bollywood then i watched garam masala i could tell from the first scene that this was not a movie i was going to like the film opens with a montage of the two leads driving around a city and apparently happening serendipitously on a series of photo setups populated with gyrating models but i kept hoping things would improve sadly they didn t the main problem is that the two protagonists mac sam are completely unsympathetic they spend the entire movie lying to women and lying brutally in order to get them into bed and the audience is supposed to find this funny and be charmed the boys are unscrupulous and inept and not in a lovable way mac even goes so far as to have one of the women drugged in order to keep her from discovering his cheating the script is extremely poor with repetitive scenes setups that never lead to anything and illogical actions and statements by the characters in fact the characters are never really developed at all the males are boorish greedy jerks and the women merely interchangeably beautiful if you go by this movie you would think that air hostesses are pretty easy to pass from man to man in reality betrayal is not so humorous the only bright spots i found in the movie were one dance number that had brilliant sets and a few slapsticky moments involving the french farce door slamming aspects of the story but bollywood dancing is better enjoyed in movies choreographed by farah khan and for slapstick you might as well just go straight to the silent comedies of buster keaton and harold lloyd who seem to have influenced writer director priyadarshan not a little priyadarshan also takes false credit for inventing the story the basic premise of the plot is stolen from the play boeing boeing the original author of that work marc camoletti is credited nowhere at least priyadarshan changed the title for this remake rather than brazenly using the original without giving credit as he did in his version of this same tale according to imdb s credits list
i have no idea as to which audience director george schlatter hoped to sell this comedy of ills with redd foxx in the central role and enough pimpy outfits and polyester to carpet the entire s norman plays like a blaxploitation picture combined with any number of silly sitcom episodes involving comic misunderstandings not to mention an elongated cameo by waylon flowers based on a play by sam bobrick and ron clark this tale of an estranged married couple foxx and pearl bailey learning the hard way that their son is secretly gay and living with a mincing prancing white homosexual has enough limp wristed jokes to shame any early episode of three s company bailey keeps her dignity and foxx s sheer confusion is good for a couple of chuckles but the rest of the performers are humiliated from
this movie is one of the most wildly distorted portrayals of history horribly inaccurate this movie does nothing to honor the hundreds of thousands of dutch british chinese american and indigenous enslaved laborers that the sadistic japanese killed and tortured to death the bridge was to be built over the bodies of the white man as stated by the head japanese engineer it is disgusting that such unspeakable horrors committed by the japanese captors is the source of a movie where the bridge itself isn t even close to accurate to the actual bridge the actual bridge was built of steel and concrete not wood what of the survivors who are still alive today they hate the movie and all that it is supposed to represent their friends were starved tortured and murdered by cruel sadists those that didn t die of dysantry starvation or disease are deeply hurt by the movie that makes such light of their dark times
sometime in saban had acquired the rights to produce a brand new ninja turtles live action series naturally being a fan of the tmnt back in the day this obviously peaked my interest so when i started watching the show to say i was disappointed by the end result is an understatement some time later more like recently i got a chance to revisit the series first off let s talk about some of the positives they managed to re create the turtles lair as it was last seen in the movies fairly well given the limited budget they threw in with this there tends to be this darker atmosphere overall in terms of the sets and whatnot and the turtle suits while not the greatest piece of puppetry and whatnot were functional and seemed pretty sturdy for most of the action stuff that would follow in the series people tend to complain about getting rid of shredder quickly and replacing him with these original villains who could have easily been used in a power rangers show but you can only have shredder get beat so many times before it gets boring and undermines his worth as a villain and besides most fans don t realize or don t remember or just plain ignore the fact that in the original comic the shredder was offed in the very first issue never mind the countless resurrections that would follow so on a personal standpoint i was sort of glad they got rid of shredder because then the anticipation would build to the point where they would eventually bring him back in a later episode i find that shredder in small quantities work best because then his encounters with the turtles are all the more memorable unfortunately they end up replacing him with these original villains who as stated seemed more fit for a power rangers show than a ninja turtles show and with these new magic wielding generics comes a new female magic wielding turtle the infamous venus de milo i ll be honest i never got comfortable with her i m not against the idea of a female turtle i m just against the idea of one who uses magic and thus sticks out like a sore sight among a clan of ninja turtles who seem somewhat out of their domain i almost get the impression that this could have easily been the venus de milo show dealing with her make believe enemies and the tmnt are just there to provide the star power or whatever was left considering the timeframe this was released fortunately they all share the spotlight together next mutation was canned after a season on the air and the creators were more than happy to ignore it given time and maybe another season i really believe this live iteration of the tmnt could have been something and might have gotten a chance at greatness but while the idea was sound the execution was flawed although there are a couple good episodes in this series as it stands next mutation is one of those oddities in turtledom that is best left buried and forgotten
for daniel auteuil queen margot was much better for nastassja kinski paris texas was much better the biggest disappointments were from chris menges crisscross and a world apart cannot even be compared with this one and goran bregovic for use of a version of the same musical theme from queen margot for this movie attention to the end of the film if this was an american pop movie i would not feel surprised at all but for a european film with more independent actors and director a similar common approach about child abuse with no original insight is very simple minded and disappointing there are those bad guys who kidnap and sell the underage people there are those poor children who hate people selling them and wait to be saved by someone and finally there is that big hero who kills all the bad guys and saves these poor children from bad guys every character is shown in simple black and white terms the good versus the evil plus from the very beginning i could understand how the story would end is this the end of the history of child sexual abuse i believe that the difficult issue of child molestation and paedophilia is much more complex than how it is portrayed in this not very original movie i think this movie was not disturbing but very disappointing
growing up with the beast wars transformers i wasn t very familiar with the original transformers and now that i have seen the awesome movie and now that i have seen the older cartoon on which it s based i have to say i like the original cartoon and the live action movie more than beast wars not that i don t like the bw characters i just think that characters like optimus prime are better than optimus primal i mean autobots transform and roll out sounds a lot better than maximals maximize the voice of the original optimus prime still makes me a strong believer that he s a real commander more so than optimus primal besides powermaster optimus prime is a lot more powerful than optimal optimus just look on the web megatron in the bw character seemed more like a humorous version of the more evil version of him in the original series besides what s cooler robots changing into animals or robots changing into vehicles and spaceships gimme the original transformers any day over beast wars
it was meant to be a parody on the lotr trilogy but this was one of the most awful movies i ve ever seen bad acting bad screenplay bad everything this is my personal opinion i don t doubt any second that there are people who ll like this sense of humor but there have been better parodies on movies from acclaimed directors as mel brooks or the zucker brothers i m working in a movie theater and in dvd shop and the success for this movie was similar in both areas at the movies it was a nice but no big at all success during the first two weeks but then when the reviews of those who have seen it were not too good the movie dropped very fast in dvd sales it was good for short time but then nobody asked for it anymore in the last ten years the two worst movies i ve seen are the ring thing and torque i can t decide which one was worse but i m happy that there a so many good movies so i don t have to think too much on this question
wow i have seen some really bad movies in my time but this one truly takes the cake it s the worst movie i ve seen in the past decade no exaggeration as a us army veteran of the war in afghanistan i found it nearly impossible to even finish watching this ridiculous film not because it brought back memories far from it but because there was absolutely no attempt at authenticity to be found anywhere in the film not so much as the tiniest little shred it seemed like it had been written by an year old child who got all his notions of war and soldierly behavior straight out of comic books the film was made in honduras which should have been a clue but even that can t fully explain the atrocious production values of this clich ridden piece of trash i could try to list all the endless technical flaws but it would take virtually forever from the ancient unit shoulder patches which have not been seen or worn since wwii and the character s name tags like colcollins worn by the character colonel collins which was actually spelled using the reversed mirror image n of the russian alphabet not the us alphabet the list just goes on and on the uniforms the equipment the plot and most especially the behavior of the characters themselves every single scene was just chock full of ridiculous flaws inaccuracies and utterly mindless clich s neither the storyline itself nor the characters were the least bit credible or believable it was all laughably childish in the extreme this was obviously a movie that was meant to appeal strictly to pre pubescent boys and i have little doubt that even they would find this film utterly absurd in short this film has absolutely no redeeming qualities at all it s a total waste of time i d strongly advise anybody reading this to pass this garbage by it s truly not worth wasting a single moment of your time for
what a huge pile of dung shot on video really crappy camcorder not digital pile of garbage it is without a doubt the stupidest thing ever made the fact that this crap was actually released is completely asanine everyone who sees it will become stupider for having watched it seriously i felt like it killed several brain cells after i watched this garbage the positive reviews of this a crap were obviously made by the filmmaker and i use the term very loosely himself and or his family and friends because no normal person with the intelligence of a squirrel would honestly like this waste of life trust me stay the hell away from this video you ll thank me for it avoid it like herpes
upon concluding my viewing of trance or the eternal or whatever the producers are calling this film i wondered to myself out of all of the bad movies i could have seen couldn t i have at least seen one that was entertaining even if a film is not well made in terms of acting directing writing or what have you it can at least be fun and therefore worthwhile but not only is this film bad in artistic value it s incredibly boring for a plot of such thinness it moves awfully slowly with little dramatic tension at the very least in a low brow attempt at entertainment the deaths of the characters could have been cool and or gory but the creators of this dreck failed in that department as well what does this movie have going for it pretty much nothing unless you get entertainment out of watching christopher walken who is capable of being brilliant put so little effort into his acting that he falls into self parody mode why did he decide to do this film anyway i give this film because god help us there actually have been worse movies made before
even if you re a huge sandler fan please don t bother with this extremely disappointing comedy i bought this movie for assuming it has to be at least halfway decent since my man sandler is in it and because i assumed some women would get naked judging by the r rating and scantily clad women on the cover well there are quite a few scantily clad women but none get naked i m not sure what point this was in sandler s career but i m guessing it was even before his snl days i can be wrong this is like watching one of his home movies he might look back at a cheesy movie like this and reminisce about the good ol times but we the audience are left to dry this is hardly a movie sandler does a lot of talking to the camera and even admits at one point that this is no budget movie that s right not a low budget movie a no budget movie so our job is pretty much to laugh at the quirky characters there is no steady plot it s like an extended sketch comedy show but a crude and badly written one that guy who played the nasty comedian was completely annoying and it was implausible in the first place that he would receive such a mass audience and sandler finds his comic inspiration by saying the one classic henny youngman line take my wife please and the audience is on the floor i m not even going to try to make any logic here sure sandler s current and recent movies are not known for making a lot of sense the penguin in billy madison the midget in happy gilmore s happy place but the comedy works this is a strictly amateurish work and even if you re curious about adam s early days in film you still won t be interested you re better off checking out his start on snl or maybe his underrated role in mixed nuts of course the sandman is not the only actor wasted in this thankless vehicle billy bob thornton also makes a short appearance billy zane titanic has a supporting role and the great burt young from the rocky movies has a significant role this awful comedy will most probably be collecting dust on the cent rental section of your local video store and rightfully so my score out of
cliff robertson as a scheming husband married to a rich wife delivers a razzie worthy performance here if there ever was one it s as if director michael anderson kept yelling dial it down think zombie only less lively through his little bullhorn as he coached robertson s effort the rest of the cast is barely better jennifer agutter of logan s run fame is hardly seen in what should have been fleshed out as a pivotal role if the quality of the acting was three times better if some of the more gaping plot holes were filled and if the pacing were given a shot of adrenaline then this yawner might be brought up to a standard acceptable to the hallmarklifetime tv channel crowd as is its rating is so inexplicably high one can t help thinking chronic insomniacs are using dominique to catch a little snoozing time perhaps the late night tv telemarketers are missing a major opportunity in not shilling it as such
some nice scenery but the story itself in which a self proclaimed egyptologist lesley anne down visits egypt and in the course of doing egyptologist things in the most un egyptologistic of ways e g flash photography in the tombs the handling of old parchment etc uncovers a black market turf war and somehow in the span of two days no less becomes that war s jumpsuit wearing epicenter is more puzzling than any riddle the sphinx ever posed down is simply awful as the visiting british scholar that she seems to know absolutely nothing about the culture of egypt and even less about antiquities is the fault of the writers certainly but that she s annoying as all get out is her own fault entirely and the rest of the cast including sir john gielgud and frank langella seem as downright confused by the proceedings as i was in short not what you d expect from schaffner planet of the apes patton and co worth watching for a laughably dated scene in which down rails against all male scholars blaming them for her failure as an academic while bathed under the softest light hollywood could muster to top it off she spends the next hour of the film shrieking and harried and running into the arms of any dude she can find wow talk about your performative irony note to would be egyptologists take a year or two of arabic in grad school it ll really help out in the long run
from everything i d read about the movie i was excited to support a film with a christian theme everything about the movie was very unprofessionally done especially the writing without good writing a movie doesn t have a chance the writer director said in an interview that he didn t want to give away how the title relates to the story believe me it was no big surprise i kept waiting for the teenage young adult back story to unfold but it never did as someone who has gone through a divorce i was very disappointed this movie would have been no comfort to me when i first went through the emotional turmoil that divorce can bring to your life as a christian
the sun should set on this movie forever it goes on forever which isn t usually a bad thing the english patient schindler s list but is so tedious the aging of the actors is unbelievable and so is the drawn out never ending story line which really seems to go nowhere in short a waste of talent and film
very bad movie and i mean very bad the plot is predictable and it s eally cheesy the creativeness of the battle and the dance scenes for the time are the only reason i didn t give the movie a one other than that this is def a movie one can def afford not to watch i feel while watching the movie the idea behind the movie was an interesting one tho kind of clich bringing country bumpkins to the city blah blah blah but i feel it might have been at least a little better if it just wasn t so cheesy very poorly portrayed from idea to screen i think the plot is somewhat predictable at times tho the dancing i can say at times is pretty good the break dance battle twist was good if u just pop the movie and watch the dance scenes and make up your own dialog maybe it can be a lol
this show is painful to watch it is obvious that the creators had no clue what to do with this show from the ever changing jobs boyfriends and cast it appears that they wanted to cast amanda bynes in something but had no idea what and came up with this crappy show they cast her as a teen surrounded by twenty and thirty somethings and put her in mostly adult situations at repeatedly failed attempts at comedy soon they realize that she needs a clique and cast people in their late s to try to pass as teenagers how this show survived seasons is beyond me somehow abc has now decided that it is a family show and thrown it into it s afternoon lineup on abc family
the movie itself is so pathetic it portrayed deaf people as cynical toward hearing people true some deaf people are wary of dating hearing people but they are not necessarily angry like of marlee matlin s character was throughout the story deaf people do not go to the bar and dance the way matlin did all in all the movie itself is more boring than pathetic it is so boring that i d like to believe that it is an insomnia cured movie if i have a problem sleeping i can simply pop in children of a lesser god and watch it will put me to sleep keep in mind this is a deaf guy talking
unentertaining uninvolving hybrid of cruel intentions and wild things but it isn t nearly as good as either of those trash min classics it s about the acting sheriff artie taye diggs being called in to investigate a near fatal drug overdose at a posh upper class univesity but to keep it on the down low as he digs deeper he thinks it s much more than it at first glance seems to be we follow alicia the girl who overdosed in flashbacks as well at about minutes if this film was welcomed to begin with it would have worn it out this film brings absolutely nothing new to the table but it is the only movie thus far that has miss swain topless so the grade is higher just for that my grade deye candy dominique swain gets topless fixing a mistake of happy campers another girl is topless anti eye candy more men ass than girl tit
macy ullman and sutherland were as great as usual ritter wasn t bad either what s her name was as pretty as usual it could have been a good movie to bad the plot was atrocious it was completely predictable trite and boring from the first minutes the rest of the movie was laid out like a child s paint by numbers routine the characters were stock pieces of cut out cardboard there was nothing new or interesting to say and that completely outweighed the acting which was a pity finally too bad the script writer wasn t the victim especially with the precocious lines from the child which were completely unbelievable again it s only the acting that prevented a much lower score
star rating saturday night friday night friday morning sunday night monday morning ray ray winstone has a criminal past has had problems with alcohol and is now forming a drug habit that is making him paranoid and prone to domestic violence to his wife valerie kathy burke who tries to hold the family together but ends up coming off more like a doormat meanwhile her mother janet laila morse is aware of ray s son billy charlie creed miles and his escalating drug habit that is sending him off the rails the film follows these despairable characters as they tredge along with their lives it is said that the british seem to enjoy being miserable and that would include watching films that entertain them this way films like nil by mouth highlight this it s a tale of a broken family torn apart by crime poverty booze and drugs the kind jeremy kyle would lap up like a three course meal it is also essentially a tale of self destructive men three generations apart and each copying the other tearing a family apart and women trying to hold it together despite not being strong enough if you pick up a little of what it s about from the off set you can see it doesn t promise to be cheerful viewing from the start and it certainly doesn t disappoint in this it s true what everyone said about the performances and the lead stars winstone and burke do deliver some great acting we see winstone lose it with his wife beating her senseless after some more coke induced paranoia breaking down during a phone conversation with her and unleashing a typical arsenal of f and c words when she refuses to let him see his kid likewise in a private moment we see burke skillfully lose her composure on a staircase the full impact of the night before kicking in this is another of those films where there s no plot to follow as such just a real life feel of these hopeless lives carrying on from one day to the next it s been acclaimed by many including the baftas but it really was just too grim and bleak for me i have no right to criticize it for this knowing what i knew about it from the off set but sadly this is how i found it
when i saw this movie i couldn t believe my eyes where these hilarious creatures dustbin muppets with big pointy teeth really meant to be scary or where they designed to have a good laugh i sincerely hope so if you watch carefully you can even see the strings operating them better dragging them across the screen the whole was rather funny than scary and i had a good time watching the movie because i was amazed by its overall incapacity to have only one good part it is one big joke from beginning to end and i believe this movie belongs into a new category so unbelievable crappy you ll be laughing from beginning to end i m not even gonna try to comment on the acting or all the other things
ok i wrote a scathing review b c the movie is awful as i was waiting another review for derrida of mine to pop up i decided to check out old reviews of this awful movie look at all the positive reviews they all i say all come from contributors have have not rated any other movie other than this one crimminy and wait till you to the rosebud sic review checkout the other movies rosebud reviewed and had glowing recommendations for oh shoot they happen to be for the only other movies by the two writers and director holy window wipers batman joe tony you suck as writers and tony you couldn t direct out of a bad script no jobs for you always check positive reviews for a low rated movie
ah yes the vs series mvc being the pinnacle it s been said before this is what you get when half of the crew fell asleep on the job unfortunately the gameplay half did don t get me wrong this is fun but you get tired of mashing buttons as for the plot summary ahahahahahaaaaa there is no plot beat that guy at the end and win eh who plays this by their self anyway
i very much looked forward to this movie its a good family movie however if michael landon jr s editing team did a better job of editing the movie would be much better too many scenes out of context i do hope there is another movie from the series they re all very good but if another one is made i beg them to take better care at editing this story was all over the place and didn t seem to have a center which is unfortunate because the other movies of the series were great i enjoy the story of willie and missy they re both great role models plus the romantic side of the viewers always enjoy a good love story
this sword sorcery story of an appallingly brutal and callous hero vanquishing an evil king is worthless in almost every detail the acting is horrible from the leads to the supporting roles the leering gloating glee with which the director shows the hero smearing blood around is absolutely disgusting nor is it redeemed by any justice to his cause since he is as bad as the people he s fighting z movie editing is abundant including a scene where a character dies from a sword thrust that very obviously missed completely the movie is clearly banking on the charms of the female leads barbi benton and lana clarkson who are paraded around mostly naked throughout the movie as a something male i will not pretend that female flesh on the screen doesn t attract me but the treatment of their characters is so degrading and the sex scenes so casual and joyless that i couldn t enjoy even this aspect of the movie most cheesy movies of this era are at least somewhat redeemed by a light hearted tongue in cheek feel the sequel is better in this regard but deathstalker seems to take itself completely seriously as heroic fantasy no way avoid at all costs rating out of
i will admit that i m only a college student at this present time an english major at that at the time i saw this film i was a high school student i want to say junior year but it may have been senior hard to remember my experience with quantum physics goes pretty much to my honors physics course an interest in quantum mechanics that has led me to read up on the subject in a number of books on the theoretical aspects of the field as well as any article i can find in discover and the like i m not a phd by any means that said this movie is simply terrible it s designed to appeal to the scientific mind of the average new age guru who desperately wants to believe in how special everybody is my mother is such a person and ever since she s seen this movie she s tried to get all her friends to see it and bought a copy of the film i attempted to point out the various flaws and problems i d seen with the films logic and science and they are numerous and she dismissed my claims because oh so a high school student knows more than all those people with phds in this case apparently so leaving behind the fact that earning a phd doesn t necessarily require that a person be correct or in fact intelligent leaving behind the fact that my basic understanding of physics is enough to debunk half the film leaving that behind the film makers completely manipulated their interviews with at least one of the participants to make it appear that he supported their beliefs when in fact he completely opposed them i could go on and on but i think intuitor did a really good job of debunking the film so feel free to read that if you care to do so http www intuitor com moviephysics bleep html
she may have an oscar and a golden globe but this film shows why she also is a perennial razzie nominee to do a film that is so bad must be an indication that she needs money she could do ads on why you shouldn t talk on a cell phone while driving especially at night on the way to a crowded mall susan montford should stick to producing shoot em up as she is not very good as a writer director she is accosted by four thugs in the mall parking lot and the first thing they do is tell her they have a gun what does she do she starts pushing and cursing them like she knows martial arts or something she manages to get away but gets lost in the forest after crashing why didn t she run to someones house we get four thugs with guns chasing a lady with a toolbox of course their guns are no match for her wrench ha of course she also has a tire iron and a screwdriver those poor thugs now she s home for christmas and she brought a gun
you gotta wonder how some flics ever get made this one decided to skip with the why among many other things and just wanders off beyond the moot and yet you have a number of decent actors doing their best to pump some life into the story the blue tint throughout the movie overshoots into yet again which on its own would be depressing but here it s overkill the idea that it s not a medical condition not some house or gypsy or trinket curse but just something that for no apparent reason starts to happen to our protagonist and then to everyone else around her just winds up being much like taking a big swig out of an empty mug some doppelgangers have super powers but others don t or don t know they do it seems they re just as clueless as we are it s a poor man s rip off of invasion of the body snatchers with keifer sutherland s mirror and the sixth sense were you to seriously botch those three together
given the people involved it is hard to see why this movie should be so messed up and dull the writer david ward wrote the amazing caper film the sting two years later jane fonda had just won an academy award for klute and donald sutherland had just done excellent work in films like klute start the revolution without me and kelly s heroes plotwise the movie is a caper tale with a small gang of bumbling misfits planning a big heist at the same time the movie wants to be hip satire a series of comedy sketches of the type that the nbc television show saturday night would do so well two years later the bad result is that the plot makes the comedy bits seem awkward and forced and the disconnected comedy bits destroy any kind of suspense that the heist might have it is quite literally a movie that keeps smashing into itself just as the cars in the cars in the demolition scenes run into each other the only real interest for me was watching jane fonda her iris caine is supposed to be a light hearted version of her dramatic bree daniels prostitute character in klute yet one doesn t believe her for a moment it is always jane fonda pretending to be a prostitute that we are watching it is as terrible a performance as her performance in klute was terrific it would be a good lesson for acting teachers to run the two films together to show how the same actress in the same type of role can be great or pathetic it suggests that actors are only as good as their writers and directors
while i watched this movie i tried to figure out why they bothered making it though the main plot of the movie is potentially good there are all sorts of unrelated unnecessary subplots the marketing people in hollywood must have dictated the multiple bad guys perpetual double crosses and the man and woman who get too close and have sex it s odd that we see more of them having sex than we did of the president and his mistress the many plots and subplots make the film too broad and none of the characters are properly developed i really didn t feel like i knew any character except that everyone is corrupt and evil the ending is totally incomplete it left me more than just wanting what might have been but what was supposed to be in the end there is really no explanation of why anyone does what they do except to serve as additional corrupt characters who commit a double cross i m surprised that so many established and good actors agreed to make such a hollow movie this seemed like a movie made by college students who are working on their nd or rd project don t waste your time unless you are in a film class and want an example of what not to do when making a movie
ugh where to begin first campbell scott s non stop angst becomes a real turn off after awhile a very short while as he internalizes his mounting anguish curiosity and anger only we don t care these characters as presented by the writer and director are wholly unlikable and therein lies the key they haven t given us anything to make us care if they are adulterous and whether or not they are still in love with one another when scott quietly tells his wife i could kill you before their three daughters at the dinner table after the shock of his selfishly poor timing wore off i almost wished that he had and then done the same thing to the smug wisecracking apparition of denis leary before being hauled off the the looney bin an utter waste of time and perhaps only perhaps resources
a terrible film which is supposed to be an independent one it needed some dependence on something this totally miserable film deals with the interactions among irish people were they trying to imitate the wonderful film crash if so this film crashed entirely there is just too much going on here culminated by a little brat running around and throwing rocks into buses and cars which obviously cause mayhem the film is just too choppy to work one woman loses her husband after years to another while her younger sister is ripped off by a suitor this causes the former sister to become a bitter vetch and walk around in clothes not worth believing the older sister also becomes embittered but soon finds romance then we have losers who purchase masks to rob a bank obviously the robbery goes awry but there doesn t seem to be any punishment for the crooks perhaps the punishment should have been on the writers for failure to create a cohesive film
in my knowledge largo winch was a famous belgium comics never read telling the adventures of a playboy a sort of james bond without the spy life so when i had to choose a movie for a years old kid i picked it up because the kid was already a great fan of james bond but just after the opening credits i got heavy doubts when american movies offer amazing start here no action and a torrid sex scene then the story get very complicated with financial moves i thought i lost the kid but strangely he had been caught by largo and more than james bond was it the excellent interpretation of tomer sisley the difficult relationship largo has with his father the multiple box story in which the friends are the bad guys the bad guys are the friends the exotic locations of honk kong yougoslavia dunno but he really cares about largo will he get up and we enjoyed our moment
what the bliep is it with this movie couldn t they fiend a better script all in all a nice movie but it has been done more than once up till the end i thought it was okay but the going back to the past part barf so corny was waiting for the fairy god mother to appear but wow that didn t happen which is good i loved big with tom hanks but to see such a movie in a new form with another kid who wished that he she is older bigger that just is so pas just watch till it comes out on tv don t get me wrong but it ain t all that
perhaps i m out of date or just don t know what electra is like in current publications but the electra that i read was far more manipulative and always seems to have a plan she usually used others to do her dirty work and more often than not some sort of double cross was involved just when you think you have it all figured out she pull the wool over your eyes and gets her way this movie was fairly weak on the dialog the acting wasn t particularly convincing and the action was spotty i was really looking for something more along the lines of frank miller s book electra assassin which is much darker than anything in this movie special effect where cool action was interesting at times but more often than not the story and plot was slow or illogical tha hand was not menacing enough and electra was not bitchy enough she s the girl you love to hate but in this story i just didn t care either way
don t really know where to start with one of the worst films i have had the displeasure to watch in a very long time from the setting which was quite obviously and very clear to anyone who has visited london for even day will agree was not london to the much unexplained way how snipe s character managed to escape the country back to the us without a single problem then he convinces the girl and grandmother to visit him in america how on earth did grandma agree to that he s an assassin well that s the ending how about during the film well unfortunately that didn t fare much better we have british cops driving an amazing range of cars i m sure it was an eighties vauxhall belmont which chased the taxi after the assignation but a modern subaru imprezza escorting the prison van in a few scenes prior so or whoever the gun toting arm of the met they were trying to portray was happily running around the streets with their guns out chasing after snipe s along with the cia there were children walking around but the police were still stating they had a clear shot to shoot him does this happen in london no it doesn t i live there we also have the very implausible travel from central london to the airport let s say heathrow for arguments sake within minutes of receiving a call we also have terrible american accents a young girl who s posher than the queen but lives in elephant castle what does it say for british police when helicopters and a number of officers at snipe s location can t find snipe s and he manages to evade capture by hiding behind some stairs the train station was obviously not even on uk soil and the fight scene sound effects were terrible the plot was also extremely poor boring and been written and filmed a lot better a thousand times before but there were a few notable actors cast in this film what were they thinking and please don t let that sway you to watch this film this film didn t seem to know what it wanted to be if you are going to concentrate on the dramatic aspects from the aftermath of an assignation then you need a strong rigid plot with plausible scenery and setting this is something the viewer has time to take in and appreciate and if you do it wrong then you notice it if you want an all out action film which this is not then continuity and scenery can be put to the side
this movie is an abomination and its making should have been considered a capital crime one of the great mysteries of film making is why nobody ever has made a faithful movie adaptation of this wonderful mystery it is a tale of a really gripping mystery nice old fashioned romance and dry english humor why did the makers have to change richard gordon from a scotland yard policeman to an amateur detective introduce the idiotic role and caricature of his english servant change the part of the main storyline about the murder charge and circumstances of gordon s struggle to save the accused etc etc these producers and directors who always think they can make a better story than the one in the book should write the original script themselves and not to rape another person s product
pretty disappointing prequel to the first two films it s got none of the suspense of the first nor the interest of the second by concentrating on the guys who run the cube it basically takes away any of the sense of tension inside the cube as we simply don t care about the characters inside much of the film is simply boring and it only becomes truly terrible with the introduction of the glass eyed superior and the green eyed crazy marine after that though it just descends into over the top unintentional hilarity the ending is fitting though tying it back into the first one in an indirect way the script is terrible the acting mediocre at best and the direction unimpressive a much lesser follow up
this is quite possibly the worst acting i have ever seen in a movie ever and what is up with the casting the leading lady in this movie has some kind of nose dis figuration and is almost impossible to look at for any period of time without becoming fixated on her nose you could go to your local grocery store on a sunday afternoon and easily find more qualified better looking possible leading ladies i made the unfortunate mistake of renting this movie because it had a cool dvd case this movie looks like it is just some class project for a group of multimedia students at a local technical college i would rather have spent the hour or so that this movie was on watching public access television at least the special effects are better and the people on there are more attractive than anyone you will see in this film
i m grateful for one thing and one thing only that this woman will now be thousands of miles away on an entirely different continent yay this programme summed up perfectly just how obsessed victoria beckham has become with whoring herself and her family out to the media in the name of self promotion and brand f cking beckham a few years ago i used to really like posh and becks i still very much admire david s talent but i have no respect for him anymore how can you respect someone who has his wife s hand shoved up his backside working him like a puppet it was clear the hand of victoria was all over beckham s premature departure from manchester united and now the same thing has happened at real madrid i hope beckham can live with the fact that although he may be earning squillions of pounds he s sold his soul for the american buck and will end his days playing for a team who would struggle to gain promotion from division one in england no offence america but at baseball and basketball you rule football you don t anyway i digress it s been years since i ve seen such an over the top entirely false performance from posh this being topped only during her cringe worthy red carpet performances following the rebecca loos debacle when instead of throwing all the cr p at david he deserved she desperately clung onto his arm trying to save the million pound money spinner her marriage has become this whole pr stunt was pathetic why can t she just go over there quietly support her husband through the biggest mistake of his professional career and keep her head down when did she become so full of self importance that she feels the move to america should be shrouded by this huge fan fare incidentally i saw the david beckham documentary last night at least he has retained a sliver of grace and humility two things his wife could do with learning one more thing victoria you complain about constantly being hounded by the paps little hint stop tipping them off about your whereabouts you stupid woman good luck america
there s one line that makes it worth to rent for angel fans everyone else this is just a very bad horror flick the female characters are typical horror movies females they are wooden annoying and dumb you are glad when they are killed off long live the strong female character in a horror movie
first off i d like to point out that sam niel is nowhere to be seen in this film what s a movie without sam niel did anyone see event horizon d wars did have potential a movie about a dragon that controls lizards with rocket launchers does sound cool but sadly isn t nope no sam niel no good movie i recommend taking the dollars or so it takes to rent d wars and adding to that five and buying a sam niel film apparently to submit this i have to have ten lines of text so heres a list of sam niel movies i recommend jurassic park dead calm hunt for red october event horizon not jurassic park threeoverall d wars is a pile
first of all really kim basinger your rich banker husband leaves you alone in your beautiful most likely paid in cash for home and you can t even put on a decent shirt i m a woman and yes i m going to come right out say it clean something starting with your hair and while you re at it it s christmas eve buy your kids some presents or at least a christmas tree don t drive minutes to the crowded mall park your car miles away and cry about it the whole walk in and simply buy wrapping paper also the next time you decide to leave someone a nasty note don t sign your name i refuse to feel sorry for della obviously due to the fact that kim basinger is this masterpiece s executive producer she wants you to feel bad for the poor white blond woman we get it alec baldwin is a jerk but seriously don t model horrible films after your own life also you re in you s you definitely wouldn t have year old twins and those names terry and tammy way to let your kids grow up with any decent chance of ever respecting themselves it s also pretty fantastic to hear the characters in the film constantly call her beautiful or refer to her as a girl obviously ms basinger had some say about what goes in the script it s also pretty awesome how none of the criminals can fight back apparently della s magical ninja skills are impossible to beat her driving skills are pretty nifty too this film is so clich it hurts wahhhhh they spelled your name wrong on the tea cup or your husband put a hole in the wall but all you can think about is buying nail polish when you re at the mall instead of maybe some plaster and paint or the woman you went to high school with bought the teddy you were looking at boohooo the fact that she refuses to take off that bright trench coat while running through the woods screaming and breaking everything in her path proves my point this woman is a moron who thinks to grab the toolbox out of the car but not their purse full of identifying artifacts such as your address i have never wanted the bad guys to succeed as much as when i watched this film and did anyone else happen to catch the african american shirt the black guy was sporting oh yes rewind and feast your eyes on perhaps the most racially stereotypical prop in a film yet don t waste and hour and twenty minutes of your life instead go do what della couldn t figure out how to do take care of your kids and maybe brush your hair that powerful ballad at the end though was pretty impressive singing i ll be home for christmas in the rain while your bloody arm clings oh so tightly to your wrapping paper is about as emotional as it gets thanks della
no wonder that the historian ian kershaw author of the groundbreaking hitler biography who originally was the scientific consultant for this tv film dissociated himself from it the film is historically just too incorrect the mistakes start right away when hitler s father alois dies at home while in reality he died in a pub in the film hitler moves from vienna to munich in while in reality he actually moved to munich in i could go on endlessly hitler s childhood and youth are portrayed way too short which makes it quite difficult for historically uninformed people to understand the character of this frustrated neurotic man important persons of the early time of the party like hitler s fatherly friend dietrich eckart or the party philosopher alfred rosenberg are totally missing the characterization of ernst hanfstaengl is very problematic in the film he is portrayed as a noble character who almost despises hitler the script obviously follows hanfstaengl s own gloss over view of himself which he gave in his biography after the war in fact hanfstaengl was an anti semite and was crazy about his fuehrer but the biggest problem of the film is the portrayal of hitler himself he is characterized as someone who is constantly unfriendly has neither charisma nor charm and constantly orders everybody around after watching the film one wonders how such a disgusting person ever was able to get any followers since we all know what an evil criminal hitler was naturally every scriptwriter is tempted to portray hitler as totally disgusting and uncharismatic but facts is that in private he could be quite charming and entertaining his comrades didn t follow him because he constantly yelled at them but because they liked this strange man beyond all those historical mistakes the film is well made the actors are first class the location shots and the production design give a believable impression of the era
not even timothy hutton or david duchovny could save this dead fish of a film for starters the script was definitely written to be made into a b film but somehow duchovny looking for a star vehicle to elevate himself out of television and hutton looking for the two of a one two punch he had hoped would define his career after ordinary people became attached to the picture cheesy lines big bad wipes from scene to scene come on who uses wipes after th grade telecommunications class and plain old bad acting sink this film even duchovny is not immune to the bad acting plague that is this film only timothy hutton rises above the material at all i must admit feeling duchovny s pain as he read the lines that are the voice over while i found myself laughing when i m sure the director wanted me to feel terrified nothing prepared me for the closing line of duchonvey s voice over if you ever need a doctor be sure to call if only the studio had called this dog of a motion picture would never have been made avoid at all costs
it was pm last night at my friend s camping trailer and we were so hyped to watch south park a new episode the thing is in my country south park airs at pm and we decided to kill time by watching the show now airing father of the pride i ll start by saying that i have only watched to episodes the first time i watched it i found it unfunny and crude for nothing so i thought holy sh t i have a football game early tomorrow so i have to stop watching stupid cartoons but yesterday i tried to give father of the pride a second chance i find that it s a complete rip off of the simpsons only replacing yellow human characters by lions instead the second thing is i wonder why it got it s tv rating i find the simpsons a lot more vulgar and the only real vulgarity in this show is a few homosexual unfunny jokes the simpsons is also a lot more violent halloween specials and crude i also heard that the creator of the series has also directed shrek well i ve got news for him shrek was way better and i think he stayed too much in the family thematic however i must admit that father of the pride did make me smile even burst out laughing once three or four times all in all i don t mind father of the pride i don t hate it but i don t like either i ve seen way better from the simpsons
generally i ve found that if you don t hear about a movie prior to seeing it on dvd there s probably a good reason for it i hadn t heard about this movie at all until i was in a blockbuster the other day and saw it on a shelf since all the good movies had already been rented out the ones i wanted to see anyway i figured i d give this one a shot it s really not much different than other movies in the genre such as the singles ward or the r m if you re into those type movies you ll probably enjoy this however if you re not a mormon this movie probably won t appeal to you there s no way to avoid the overtly religious mormon message contained within and at times it comes across as sappy and cheesy ultimately if you don t fall within the mormon demographic you re probably better off watching something else admittedly there were some very funny moments in the film but i didn t think that it was enough to salvage the movie overall
one of the worst movies i ve ever seen acting was terrible both for the kids and the adults most to all characters showed no little or not enough emotion the lighting was terrible and there were too many mess ups about the time of the day the film was shot in the river scene where they just get their boat destroyed there s shots the sheriff and dad in the evening on their boat jillian and molly in the evening swimming the rest of the kids in the daytime when it s supposed to in the evening at the river bank and the doctor beatrice and simonton at night but not in the evening getting off their boat the best acting in the movie was probably from the sheriff cappy although there s a slip of character when the pulse detector whatever that thing is when people die it beeps shows cappy has died he still moves while it can still be heard beeping and while the nurse extra checks his pulse manually then it shows the pulse again and then he finally dies i guess it s not going to be perfect since it s an independent movie but it still could be better not worth watching honestly even for kids might as well watch something good like the lion king or toy story if you re going to see anything you ll remember
i watched this movie to the end and that was really not easy it is so boring bad played and in nearly every detail stolen from blair witch project that you can t believe the makers take this serious even harder to believe is how this product made it onto vhs and dvd so if want to see a horror movie just watch scream but if you want to laugh out loud and have a good time watching some kids running through the woods screaming at each other and showing of their inability watch dark area
this movie was the most horrible movie watching experience i have ever had to endure and what is worse is the fact that i had to watch it and didn t have the opportunity to stop it because it was for school admittedly the storyline was decent but i found the acting terrible the exception was marianne jean baptiste i thought her performance was wonderful she was the only highlight without her i doubt i would have been able to bear watching the film every time i hear somebody say daarling i cringe i nearly attacked a customer the other day because they said it it made me remember one of the worst one and a half hours of my life i apologise if this has offended anybody i am only expressing my opinion
the special effects of this movie are especially for its time laughable and used in such an over emphasized way that you can t deny their terrible existance the acting redefines the term terrible overacting at the hands of meg foster and richard joseph paul where julie newman and andrew divoff just redefine bad spoilers the charm in this movie can be found in two things first is the excellent casting of carel lurch struycken as the mysterious psychic gaunt who can sense where and when people will die and is always there the second are original finds the combination sf western is obviously original if terrible but other finds are more original like the gunman zack stone being able to sense the pain of the people he shoots though his acting falls short here overal don t see this movie except if you love that ol hunk o brutal carel struycken as any self respecting dutchman should
whoever wrote the script for this movie does not deserve to work in hollywood at all not even live there and those actors need to find another job the most dreadful hour and some minutes of my life and i only kept watching to see if it would get better which unfortunately for me it did not even at the end the credits gave me anxiety i guess there weren t a lot of people behind the movie so they had to roll the credits slowly very slowly this movie is definitely a great how not to make a movie guide too bad i can t give a
as soon as i began to see posters and hear talk about this movie i was immediately excited the matrix was an incredible to behold and i couldn t wait to see the second one especially after beginning to see the trailers for it at other movies however when i saw it i left the theater extremely disappointed as did many other movie goers at the theater with me while the action scenes in the movie were amazing as always there simply were too few of them in the first movie there was constant fighting going on it seemed but the second took a much more and much unfortunate preachy point of view to sum up the plot there wasn t much to it that wasn t expected the machines were digging toward zion with intent of destroying it that s not a spoiler everyone saw it in the commercials the dialogue of the movie was absolutely horrendous unless you re a psychology major you most likely will not understand most of what is said in the movie and because of that simply won t care it became somewhat of a romantic movie with the showing of events happening in the lives and relationship of neo and trinity agent smith for as bad ass as he was in the first movie seemed to get all religious and preachy personally i don t need to hear about that or pay money to listen to it the movie was a serious waste of my time and i don t think i can watch the first one anymore the dialogue and the constant boring and dry monologues from basically every character made me lose interest in the film quickly and the small amount of good fighting scenes pushed me nearer the edge and the ending of the movie shoved me right off what movie ends with to be concluded how original is that folks i wonder if the wachowski brothers had to burn the midnight oil to come up with that one in conclusion the movie was bad and that s the end of it
this is one of the worst movies i ve seen in a long time the story was boring the dialogue was atrocious and the acting hammy i m not sure if this movie was the result of a film school homework project but it certainly played like one it is not even particularly successful in its central conceit of trying to appear as a single continuous take the whooshing horizontal camera pans are a cheap and unoriginal way of hiding cuts
shazbot is this embarrassing in fact here s a list of that makes up the embarrassment a failed comeback for christopher lloyd jeff daniels basically playing the same role he played in the live dalmatians remake which wasn t too juicy to begin with he sure has a funny way of promoting his purple rose theatre disnefluff another disappointing reminder that wallace shawn is to disney what jet li was to bob hoskins in unleashed ray walston the original martian from the tv series played a bit part read cameo in this flick and died two years later of lupus coincidence awful special effects seriously awful that damn talking farting suit voiced to an annoying degree by wayne knight newman my favorite scene ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha whew good one you you re a joker okay let s wrap up this review with a moment of silence for this franchise s agonizing death and if you would like you can say a quick prayer that disney doesn t forget this travesty and do something silly like a movie adaptation of mork and mindy starring tim allen
just cause showcases sean connery as a harvard law prof kate capshaw does she still get work as his wife slight age difference and lawrence fishburne as a racist southern cop and ed harris in a totally over the top rendition of a fundamentalist southern serial killer weird casting but the movie plays serious mindf with the audience don t read if you ever intend to seriously watch this film or to ever watch this film seriously due to the spoilers first of all i felt myself rolling my eyes repeatedly at the liberal stereotypes the cops are all sadistic and frame this black guy with no evidence the coroner witnesses and even the lawyer of the accused collaborate against him he is accused of the rape and murder of a young girl because he is black connery is a harvard law prof who gives impassioned speeches about the injustices against blacks and against the barbarous death penalty he is approached by the convicted man s grandmother to defend him and re open the trial connery is stonewalled yawn by the small town officials and the good il boys club but finds that the case against blair the alleged killer now on death row was all fabricated the main evidence was his confession which was beaten out of him the beating was administered by a black cop who even played russian roulette to get the confession out of him connery finds out that another inmate on death row actually did the murder and after a few tete a tetes with a seriously overacting hannibal lecter like ed harris he finds out where harris hid the murder weapon he gets a re trial and blair is freed i think film over then suddenly it turns out that blair is a psychotic psycho and that he used white guilt to enlist connery he concocted the story with ed harris in return for blair carrying out a few murders for harris now blair is on the loose again thanks to connery s deluded pc principles the final min are a weird action movie tacked onto a legal drama connery and fishburne fighting the serial killer in an alligator skinning house on stilts yes you read that right in the everglades that was one weird film so the whole system is corrupt and inefficient the cops are all just bullies and abu graib type torturers but the criminals are really psychotics and deserve to fry truly depressing on every level the system is completely rotten and the pc white guilt types who challenge it are seriously deluded too two thumbs down connery obviously had to make a mortgage payment or something
this film was hard to get a hold of and when i eventually saw it the disappointment was overwhelming i mean this is one of the great stories of the twentieth century an unknown man takes advantage of the unsuspecting airline industry and gets away with millions in ransom without hurting anyone or bungling the attempt with all of this built in interest how could anyone make such a lackluster talk laden flick of this true life event while williams is always interesting the screenwriters assumed that the d b cooper persona was stereotypically heroic like a movie star s what we get is a type without any engaging details or insights into the mind of a person daring enough and clever enough to have pulled it off harrold practically steals the movie with her spunk and pure beauty but the real letdown was in the handling of the plot and the lame direction shame on this film for even existing
this movie could be used in film classes in a how not to script a b movie course there are inherent constrictions in a b movie budgets are tight time is precious scarecrow was apparently shot in days and the actors are often green and inexperienced the one aspect you have complete control over is writing the best script you can within the limitations set before you scarecrow s script seems to have been written in a drunken haze i could go through about fifteen examples of the nonsensical scripting of this movie but i ll just mention one the gravedigger the character of the gravedigger is introduced about an hour into the movie he seemingly has no connection to any of the other characters already in the movie he is shown with his daughter who also has no connection to anybody else in the movie the gravedigger is given a couple scenes to act surly in and then is killed to pad out the body count why give the gravedigger a daughter why give the daughter a boyfriend why introduce them so late in the movie why not try to make them part of the ongoing storyline scarecrow doesn t seem to care the story of scarecrow goes something like this lester is a high school kid played by and actor who d i d peg to be in his early s who is picked on by the other kids he is an artist who draws birds and has a crush on a classmate named judy his mom is a lush and the town whore one of her reprobate boyfriends makes fun of his drawings by calling him a faggot for drawing birds instead of monsters and cowboys if you have a high school student still drawing cowboys i d think him to more likely be gay than a high school student who draws crows and later kills lester in a cornfield under the titular scarecrow magically lester s soul goes into the scarecrow somehow this transference changes lester s soul from that of an artist into that of a wisecracking gymnast i know some reviews have called the scarecrow a kung fu scarecrow i disagree the scarecrow practically does a whole floor routine before jumping onto the truck during the climax of the movie the scarecrow then goes on to kill those who tormented him those who smoke pot in the corn field those who dig graves boyfriends of daughters of gravediggers pretty much anyone who showed up on the movie set the bonus feature on the dvd should be mentioned the director a frenchman does an impromptu version of rap music admits he enjoys not having executives around on set so he can screw his wife while working and gives a quote to live by and i m paraphrasing life ez a bitch but et has a great ass number of beers i drank while watching this movie did it help no number of beers needed to enjoy this movie whatever it takes to get to blackout drunk level
i love jane austen s stories i ve only read two of them p p and s s but after having seen this adaption i m reaching for persuasion from my bookcase just to make sense out of the story and also because i refusing to believe jane austen could have written such nonsense for me i thought that if you base a film on a jane austen novel you can t really go wrong it will turn out great pretty much by default i was wrong first of all where are the characters that you sympathise with and like you have to have at least one likable character to get the audience to invest their emotions in them and this did not deliver sure i wanted anne and wentworth to get together but only because that s what you know the purpose of the story is them getting together instead i had to resist urges to throw my teacup at the tv and to continue watching it to the end anne was utterly annoying throughout and in the end i really have no idea why wentworth was so smitten by her as there seemed to be nothing there for him to be attracted to she was meek bland dull socially inadequate and came across like a sheep following everyone else s instructions rather than having a mind of her own this can still work for a lead character if you do it well this wasn t done well the other characters were just displaying various degrees of narcissism of which mary was the worst with a full blown narcissistic personality disorder where mrs bennet in p p had similar flaws she was still endearing whereas mary was more of a freak show more loathsome than funny wentworth was very handsome and seemed like a decent kind of guy for the most part of the story i was just wondering what kind of person he was and why he s in love with anne as surely he s the kind of guy who would want a person who is a little bit more alive acting wise not too much to say as i reacted more to the characters being portrayed rather than how good bad the people acting were anthony head was excellent but as soon as i saw he was in it i expected no less also found the story very confusing it wasn t until the end of the movie where it seemed as if elizabeth was not anne s stepmother but in fact a sister i m still not on that the whole anne wentworth back story was also a bit fuzzy they had been together but then broke up and they re both bitter about it how come i was wondering this for quite some time and the explanation seemed to be she dumped him because she was persuaded to do so by someone but it was said in a kind of by the by way that it was almost missed as if it was somehow unimportant how can it be unimportant when it s the very core of the story there was also a lot of name dropping but no real feel for who the characters were this louisa person for instance who was she a friend family what it wasn t made very clear who the different characters are and their relationship with one another lady russell was there a lot but why mrs croft and wentworth were brother and sister which felt very unrealistic as mrs croft looked old enough to be his mother the final kiss yes it was a bit strange them kissing in the street but i didn t really think about it because i was too busy yelling get on with it already at the tv because anne s lips trembled and trembled and trembled for what felt like ages before they actually met wentworth s have some hesitation there but only for a couple of seconds or so not half a minute then there s the issue of camera work as a regular movie watcher you don t pay attention to angles and such unless you decide to look out for it i didn t decide to do so here but i still noticed them to me that means the filmmakers are not doing a good job a lot of conversations were with extreme facial closeups something that should only be used when there s a really important point to be made in this adaption it was over used and therefore lacked meaning the hand held feeling on occasion also didn t really work in a period drama the camera work in the running scene in the end also felt too contemporary not to mention the running itself this was the only austen adaption i caught in itv s austen season makes me wonder if it s worth watching northanger abbey and mansfield park or if i should just read the books and leave it at that i m sad to say this is a jane austen adaption i did not enjoy maybe i ll watch the version instead the bbc are renowned for having done beautiful austen adaptations before after all
just finished watching can t say i was impressed it starts of quite good the visual and the atmosphere gives a creepy feeling as this type of movie should but it all ends when the first lordi monster appears not only do you recognize them from the band lordi but they are seriously malplaced in the movie doomsday monsters with leather jackets and piercings are so s as for the storyline it starts of as similar horror movies people trapped inside a hell hole but there is no clear story on why and what is happening the viewer is thrown some lines on possible reasons but the lines never meet and end up to anything but a mess with all the money spent on this film with an intriguing start and some good effects i had thought someone would have taken better care of the product i wonder if lordi made this movie just to prove that their show costumes could be scary except they aren t so the movie gets cred for the visuals i guess the money had to go somewhere but the rest is an embarrassing attempt from a rock band to make their on stage monster aliases scarier
there are a lot of pretentious people out there who will pretend that this is endowed with some kind of beautiful meaning and that ignorant fools like me don t get it obviously this means that we should stick to hollywood dross it has every a hem artistic clich in the book i guess it is good that the director is one of the chosen few almost a self parody drowning in its own pretense the director of the almost equally embarrassing movie ratcatcher returns with another piece wallowing in artistic nonsense it is difficult to understand and apparently is a study of alienation the best way to describe this film is alienating for its viewers
i bought a dvd of this film for my girlfriend who shares the same name as the ghost girl in this film and enjoys movies about the paranormal the movie was shot entirely on video so it has the look of a pbs special about it the special effects are phoney looking but there are actually some scary moments in the movie that got us to jump in our seat there is a particularly effective scare involving a virgin mary statue however the acting is bad the plot scenes are long and very boring and i will tell you i have no clue what happened at the end if you get the movie rent it if you buy it please make sure you pay less than
some wonder why there weren t anymore mrs murphy movies after this one will it s because this movie totally blew snot disney was not the right studio to run this film maybe touchstone well they re owned by disney but it d be more adult the film is too kid ish as the book series is not the casting is all wrong for the characters the characters don t even act the way they do in the books and why was tucker changed to a guy he s a girl in the frigging books was this done to make the film appeal to boys sheesh and where was pewter the gray cat one of the funniest characters from the book is absent from this filth rita mae brown is a good writer but letting disney blow her work was wrong an animated feature film perhaps in the vane of don bluth s artwork would suit a better mrs murphy film overall i give this a because at least disney made a film from an under appreciated book series but i wish they did better either way i still have my books to entertain me
this straight to video duffer is another nail in the coffin of rick moranis s career as is the disney tradition quality is sacrificed in the name of a quick cash in this is a lazy retread with moranis accidentally shrinking himself and a few relatives so they can repeat all the best scenes from the original movie instantly dated visual effects and crummy dialogue abound in this cheesy lamer which did nothing but make me pine for the days of the incredible shrinking man when this kind of thing was done properly shockingly this is directed by top cinematographer dean cundey who should either stick to the day job or pick better material next time
not as bad as you ve heard there are actually some funny parts and affleck and applegate have fairly good chemistry applegate in particular is appealing and likable as affleck s love interest james gandolfini and catherine o hara are consummate professionals they re pretty good in just about everything in the end surviving is not the worst holiday movie you ll ever see unfortunately it is unfocused and much of the comedy is forced the attempts at dark humor come off as dour affleck tries hard to be endearingly spastic and overenthusiastic but comes across as disturbed his character s cartoonish nature is brought into high relief when viewed next to gandolfini and o hara s more muted believable performances even by the relaxed standards of holiday movies you never fully buy into the set up of affleck renting this family for x mas there are also scenes that border on the surreal in their strangeness the x mas eve scene replete with incestuous humor a son being discovered looking at naked provocative pictures of his mother that not only isn t funny or believable but disturbing to make matters worse the colors in this film are muddy almost noirish the house set on which most of the movie takes place looks stagey and cheap surviving is mostly of interest as the fourth in a string of box office duds paycheck gigli jersey girl and this for affleck it remains to be seen how lasting the damage will be
i saw this dull waste of time on hbo s comedy channel so i quite innocently and obviously assumed that this was a comedy but there is absolutely nothing funny here a good cast is basically wasted on a script that i could have written with my left butt cheek after it had been beaten senseless by th century inquisition torturers the first half is particularly bad as it has some of the most dull pointless dialogue i ve come across in a while and zero comma zero plot to speak of just the fact that stars such as ewan mcgregor and zeta jones are in this little movie and yet this film has less than votes on this site should tell you everything a couple of nice shots of waves hitting the cold british coast but that s about it this is the sort of movie that gets made just because the people who wrote it have good connections family connections preferably and or plenty of cash lying around
hmmm where to start how does a serious actress like demi moore got involved in such crap first blood might be rated as bull t but this type of nonsense is just rambo with tits point of course if you are interested in the crapstory demi moore just wants to prove that a woman can be part of the navy seals that is the most stupid clich one i can think of you ll say gi jane is a great movie just the performance from viggo mortensen made this movie bearable but hell i can t think of demi moore being rambo especially not during the last useless minutes ridley scott doesn t deserve the credits to make this movie one that comes up for women with equal rights it s just brainless propaganda for the american army and to make it more attractive they dropped moore in it awful movie
peter fonda is so intentionally enervated as an actor that his lachrymose line readings cancel out any irony or humor in the dialogue he trades sassy barbs and non witty repartee with brooke shields as if he were a wooden block with receding hair even his smaller touches like fingering a non existent mustache on his grizzled face don t reveal a character so much as an unsure actor being directed by himself an unsure filmmaker in the southwest circa a poor gambler not above a little cheating wins an orphaned would be teen lolita in a botched poker game after getting hold of a treasure map promising gold in the grand canyon the bickering twosome become prospectors some lovely vistas and an odd but interesting cameo by henry fonda as a grizzled canyon man are the sole compensations in fatigued comedy drama with the two leads being trailed by cartoonish killers who will stop at nothing until they get their hands on that map shields is very pretty but although the camera loves her pouty glossy beauty she has no screen presence and her tinny voice has no range whatsoever every time she opens her mouth one is inclined to either cringe or duck from
other than some neat special effects this movie has nothing to offer they threw in some gore and some nudity to try and make it interesting but with no success kevin bacon s acting was pretty good but he couldn t salvage the movies lack of plot
the three stooges in a feature length western comedy musical perhaps rockin in the rockies was meant to combine the stooges comedy short with the western musical in a matin e if so this was a pleasant way to break up a saturday afternoon jay kirby as rusty is a handsome young hero and mary beth hughes as the blonde june and gladys blake as the brunette betty are pretty women the hoosier hotshots are a harmonious group their songs are quite tuneful however this is the s not the s so the film doesn t exactly rock there are a few laughs but the stooges brand of humor is more subdued than usual the talking horse is also underutilized rockin in the rockies vernon keays moe howard larry fine curly howard mary beth hughes
so we get so see added footage of brando interesting but not exactly oscar worthy stuff susannah york was hardly a slouch new scene where lois finds out clark is superman is slightly unbelievable in that he doesn t notice that there are blanks coming out of the gun instead of real bullets real bullets would have penetrated his clothes and then bounced off him onto the floor but forget that let s listen to donner make fun of lester s version that made more logical sense the president talks of the zod defacing the washington monument when it was originally mount rushmore tweaking that scene made that line quite absurd superman s freedom of the press line sounded silly compared to care to step outside which was delivered better and had a fitting connection to clark s earlier scene in the truck stop then there is the ending with the turn back the world to go back in time effect it turned back everything in the whole movie and made you wonder where exactly the rocket aimed for hackensack n j ever went since it doesn t free zod and company any more
i was gifted with this movie as it had such a great premise the friendship of three women bespoiled by one falling in love with a younger man intriguing not i hasten to add these women are all drawn in extreme caricature not very supportive of one another and conspiring and contriving to bring each other down anna chancellor and imelda staunton could do no wrong in my book prior to seeing this but here they are handed a dismal script and told to balance the action between slapstick and screwball which doesn t work too well when the women are all well known professionals in a very small town and for intelligent women they spend a whole pile of time bemoaning the lack of men sex lust in their lives i felt much more could have been made of it given a decent script and more tension the lesbian sub plot went nowhere and those smoking drinking women all in their forties were very unrealistic even in the baby scene screw the baby gimme a cigarette right like i said a shame of a waste out of
it s been a long time since i last saw a movie this bad the acting is very average the story is horribly boring and i m at a loss for words as to the execution it was completely unoriginal o and this is as much a comedy as clint eastwood s a pregnant schwarzenegger one of the first scenes the one with the television show where the hell are you got it right the cast was of let s face it forgotten actors if they were hoping for a career relaunch then i think it might never happen with this on their cv the script had the potential but neither of the actors nor the director who s an actor and clearly should stick to being an actor pulled it off fred durst was the only one who seemed better than any of the rest i m sorry but if you ever consider watching this i highly recommend you turn to something less traumatic because not only it s a total loss of time but also a weak example of what bad cinema looks like
i saw this movie thinking that it would be one of those old b movies that are fun to watch i was so wrong this movie was boring and obviously aimed at males who like looking at corpulent women the story was so ridiculous and implausible that it lost my interest altogether it seemed to be in the same genre as the ed wood films bottom of the barrel
i don t understand people why is it that this movie is getting an i had high hopes for this movie but once i was about a half hour into it i just wanted to leave the theater in the vast majority of the reviews on this site people are saying that this is one of the best action movies they ve seen or of the summer year etc they say it s an excellent conclusion wtf what has been concluded besides the fact that bourne can ride motorcycles shoot and fight better than anyone else he comes across what do you learn about bourne s character in this movie absolutely f nothing okay there s a lot of action but what s so great about the action in this movie i don t like the cinematography and film editing the shaky camera effect and fast changing shots were used too much and they get old fast i didn t mind them in supremacy because it was still easy to follow and was not used in excess and made me quite dizzy i was quickly wishing i had saved my for something else this movie has no plot all this movie is is a minute chase seen bourne who you learn absolutely nothing about in the entire minutes of the movie is a perfectionist at everything he attempts there is absolutely no character development in this movie you know nothing about anyone and there is a wide array of new characters that are introduced in this installment some people said that this movie has incredible writing and suspense what writing what suspense there s no suspense bourne is so perfect at doing everything he does i don t think he has anything to worry about if this is the best movie of the year i may just quit watching movies entirely many people have also said that matt damon s performance in this movie is one of the best if not the best of his career what performance how many lines did he have in this movie i have some respect for damon because he has been in movies that i liked and has played different kinds of characters but a good actor is someone that you can barely recognize from one movie to the next someone who chooses different types of roles not someone who plays the same roles over and over again which damon doesn t do but an example of someone who does is vin diesel anyways this movie was a big disappointment to me i do not recommend this movie but i do recommend the first two bourne identity and bourne supremacy and i most definitely recommend reading the three books which are much different then the movies
i am a guy who loves guy movies i was looking forward to seeing a dragon fighting with the army with cool special effects all of this happened however this movie was the worst movie i have ever seen in my life the story was standard but the portrayal of the story was terrible the scene transitions were the worst i have ever seen why would you walk out to a beach to relax if your life was in danger the serpent dragon s actions itself was very poorly written and the serpent dragon s attack capabilities varied widely throughout the movie several times the main characters should have died the director attempted to infuse a love story in the middle of the movie during the most stressful times this movie was obviously not watched after it was made i love movies but had to force myself to finish watching it thank god i did not buy this i borrowed it from a friend do not buy this do not rent it just watch discovery channel much more exciting
imagine that in adapting a james bond novel into a movie the filmmakers eliminated all the action and suspense in order to make it kid friendly or if a television producer told chris rock he couldn t cuss so that his specials could be rated pg in the same way the director of the movie something wicked this way comes took out the excitement and gore in favor of melodrama for younger audiences this created a monotonous plot without the complications of the book in trying to make the story of something wicked this way comes easier for children to follow the filmmakers eliminated the theme of good and evil both existing in everyone and good always prevailing over evil this is apparent in will s character transformation charles halloway s rescue of jim and the carnival s defeat will s transformation into a more adventurous boy has been muted in the movie the scene in which the dust witch visits will s house in a balloon has been cut from the film instead a green mist follows jim and will home and gives them the same bad dream about the witch and her spiders the balloon attack shows us that will has begun to conquer his fear of doing things on his own he gets on top of a neighbor s roof and tears the balloon with a bow defeating the witch sorry dad he thought and sat up smiling this time it s me out alone will decides as he prepares to face her removing this scene from the movie prevents us from understanding that will is becoming more adventuresome the film shows us many examples of will being afraid to follow jim but never growing curious like his friend in the book will has both a good quiet side and an evil daring side like his jim in the movie each boy only has one mode of thought which destroys bradbury s theme of both good and evil being present in each person in the book will saves jim because of their friendship but in the movie charles halloway saves jim to repay jim s father will pulls jim off the carousel in bradbury s novel because he doesn t want his best friend to grow up without him it is the good in will the fact that he cares about his friend that saves jim from the evil curse of the carnival on the carousel jim gestured his other hand free to trail on the wind the one part of him the small white separate part that still remembered their friendship this shows that there was good left inside of jim which has the potential to still defeat evil but when charles halloway saves jim in the movie he does it to repay the debt he owes jim s father who saved will when he was a little boy by changing the motivation for saving jim the filmmakers have ruined bradbury s original idea that it takes good to win against evil in the end of the movie the carnival is defeated by a tornado and lightning instead of smiles and laughter when the book ends mr dark turns himself into a little boy and charles halloway smiles and laughs at him so much that he can t stand it and evaporates in bradbury s world evil people feed off fear and can only be defeated by happiness and love his message is that good will always prevail over evil but only if that goodness is expressed outwardly good to evil seems evil says charles halloway as he holds the dying mr dark so i will do only good to you jed i ll simply hold you and watch you poison yourself in the movie mr dark is the only one left on the carousel when lightning hits it and he dies by eliminating the weapon of laughter and smiles the filmmakers imply that bad weather is the most effective way to defeat evil as if lightning only strikes those who are bad this takes away the major theme of bradbury s book which is that doing good toward others wards off evil good may always triumph over evil but trying to make movies more kid friendly will always force filmmakers to leave out some of the themes from the books they are based on in the movie something wicked this way comes will does not transform will s friendship does not save jim and smiles and laughter do not defeat the carnival as a result the filmmakers have left out too many of bradbury s main points the process of adapting a book to a movie too often ruins the world the author has established in the case of this story bradbury s frightening world of opposing forces of good and evil has been reduced to a tamer simpler version of itself
if you are wondering where many of the conspiracy theories and paranoid ideas about the the un israel and international affairs come from look no further this isn t a supernatural hollywood film loosely based on some biblical passage instead this movie was made by a company cloud ten pictures with a political and religious agenda as a movie the end result at times more looks like clips out of a televangelism program complete with family prayers and light breaking through church windows while harps are playing for mainstream viewers it may be hard to believe but many people believe in this stuff literally as presented in the movie and that perhaps makes the movie important you probably won t find a more concise exposition of the bizarre views of a significant number of your fellow citizens so if you view it view it as a social cultural document if you are at all media savvy you don t need to be warned about the unsubtle attempts at propaganda and manipulation in the movie
how this piece of garbage was put to film is beyond me the only actor who is at all known to me is judge reinhold an accomplished actor whose presence is merely a justification for putting it into production i don t even think it is worth a nomination for a rotten tomato award this film really does make b movies a cinematic enjoyment a car travelling along the freeway with police in tow and no one knows how to stop the car yeah right the script must have been written on the back of a cigarette carton most made for tv movies are awful but this redefines the word check out the acting skills of the bridge operator pure oscar material
i have just seen this movie and have not read the book the good thing of the movie is that at some parts it gets you thinking for a little while on the spiritual subject evolution sincronicity and your part in the world however the movie s immersion is easily broken and there is very little rapport between the viewer and the characters it is very clear that the book looses a lot in this movie version the events that were suppose to show sincronicity taking place are almost unrecognizable a lot of reasoning has to be done for the viewer to see that the scene indicates a coincidence and even more to imagine that it has something to do with a greater purpose enlightenment scenes are visually poor and do not create the better feeling that it was supposed to do you recall the enlightenment with keanu reeves in little buddha well this is nothing like that most scenes are poorly executed there are a lot of scenes that really don t develop the story and also do not help in creating an atmosphere the better actors in this movie namely hector elizondo joaquim de almeida and j rgen prochnow cannot save it the first seem to have gotten more scenes than their characters should in an attempt to save the movie and because they were paid more but this does not work most of the scenes are not really necessary and do not help the story at all j rgen does good in his scenes and sells as an evil guy as always but the script does not help him at all the scene where he first tries to convince john matthew settle to join him is just bad script the execution of the scene when he dies in an explosion is absurdly bad executed the flashbacks throughout the movie cannot even be commented overall this movie is a big waist of time read the book i have not read it but it is probably a billion times better than this it has to be it is so bad that i had to write my first comment in imdb
when i first picked this film up i was intrigued at the basic idea and eager to see what would happen i m a fan of animation and love it when it s successfully merged with live action footage however the animation in this film was about all i enjoyed although it must be said that the actors performances were excellent the visual look including the animation gave a wonderfully unnerving air to the piece however this was quality of unease was lost amongst the overblown imagery both visual and in the script that you were practically hammered over the head with most annoying about this was the relative lack of importance to the plot it seemed that the plot was shoe horned in at irregular intervals giving a stuttering effect that detracted massively from the flow of the piece the voice overs from felisberto especially the one at the end very much felt like a desperate attempt to fill in gaping holes in the plot which had been ignored in favour of side issues such as the whole ant thing and even that wasn t properly addressed i m afraid the whole piece came across as at best a reasonable first attempt by a teenager who has spent far too much time reading dh lawrence not what you expect from seasoned film makers at all
i went to school with jeremy earl that is how i heard of this movie i don t really know if it was in the theater s at all i don t recall the name i have seen it it is like one of those after school specials the acting is ok not great the plot was kind of weak and the lines were pretty corny so the only comment i can give this movie is eh i borrowed the movie from jeremy if i was in a movie rental place this is one that i would walk past and after watching it i wouldn t recommend it to anyone past middle school age i ve also noticed that many times when urban kids are portrayed the slang is overused or just outdated many times i think thats what makes their characters unbelievable
yet another movie with an interesting premise and some wondrous special effects falling right into the trash can boring direction and performances with the exception of the lovely annabel schofield who is much cuter as a brunette and probably deserves better material and the ever earnest charlton heston earn the rating of a real stinker it s amazing to watch heston perform up to his usual par and display how really bad this movie is he even plays in a sub plot that kept me interested just to see how it tied back into the main line of the movie the way they ended up resolving it was that they didn t it simply falls off the end really don t waste your time on this one
ok so i am like most people give me free tickets and i will go and see most things now that multiplex cinemas are so good i remember the old flea pit single screen cinemas and i am the healthy side of in england this film was released as liar it s a dog it is a total waste of good celluloid for the photograpy and set only

serum starts as eddie derek phillips is delighted to learn he has been accepted into medical school to carry on the family tradition of becoming an md like his father richard dennis o neill his uncle eddie david h hickey however his joy could be short lived as eddie is involved in an accident is run over by a car taken to the nearest hospital it doesn t look good for poor eddie so his uncle eddie convinces his brother richard to let him save eddie with the serum he has developed a serum which will give the recipient the power to self heal any sort of wound or illness desperate for his boy to live richard agrees but the procedure has unwanted side effects like turning eddie into a brain eating zombie which is just not a good thing executive produced written directed by steve franke i ll be perfectly frank myself say serum is awful serum is one of those no budget horror films which tries to rip off other any number of other s ends up being slightly more fun than having you fingernails pulled out with pliers the script is terrible it has the whole re animator feel to it with mad scientists wielding huge syringes trying to eradicate death but it s so boring it s untrue the first forty minutes is nothing more than a really dull soap opera that amounts to nothing expect to pad the running time out with eddie arriving home after spending some time away finding his ex girlfriend has hooked up with someone else arguments with his step mom getting drunk with his mate generally boring the audience stiff so once the tedium of the first forty minutes is over if your still watching it it takes another twenty minutes to get eddie re animated then he kills a couple of people police catch up with him shoot him the end thank god serum is devoid of any of the characteristic s that one would associate with a good film the character s suck the dialogue is poor it takes itself far too seriously it s dull it s slow it s forgettable considering it s meant to be a horror film there s an alarming lack of blood gore or horror not recommended did i mention serum was boring i thought so director franke does nothing to liven this thing up although competent there s no style here at all the gore levels are none existent there s a bit of splashed blood a bitten neck a couple of scars on a dead woman s face a couple of scenes where a needle pierces skin that s it don t expect a re animator in the gore department because if you do your going to be sorely disappointed much like i was in fact filmed in what looks like one house one restaurant a lab the film has no variety either just looks cheap throughout there s a couple of scenes of nudity but that s nowhere near enough to save it technically the film isn t too bad at least it looks like proper cameras were used i can t really comment on the special effects because there aren t any but generally speaking serum looks reasonably professional apparently shot in texas or should that read it should have literally been shot in texas the acting sucks although again i think they were proper actor s rather than friends or family of the director serum is a terrible film it s dull slow boring has no gore feels like a horrible soap opera for the first forty minutes i don t understand why anyone would feel the need to watch this when they can watch re animator or one of it s sequels again instead seriously i recommend you give serum a miss there i ve just saved you from wasting minutes of your life you can thank me later
what a let down this started with an intriguing mystery and interesting characters admittedly it moved along at the speed of a snail but i was nevertheless gripped and kept watching david morrissey is always good value and he suranne jones were good leads the muslim aspects were very interesting we were tantalised with possible terrorist connections but then morrissey s character was killed off and all the air left the balloon the last episode was dull dull dull the whole thing turned out to be very small beer and the d nouement was unbelievably feeble five hours of my life for that my advice watch paint dry instead

ah yez the sci fi channel produces yeti another abominable movie i was particularly taken by the scenes immediately following the crash where as the survivors desperately searched for matches at least a half dozen fires burned with no apparent reason at various points of the wreckage fire seemed to be a predominate theme throughout they searched corpses for lighters and matches and finally finding a box built a fire every day for apparently but no one ever gathered wood then when the vegan hah burned the bodies what did she use for an accelerant i mean these guys were frozen well maybe not despite the apparent low temperature everything the yeti ate bled maybe it s just me but even in a totally unbelievable tale none of the survivors had ever heard of a yeti or an abominable snowman until the very end if you take care of the little things the bigger deals become more acceptable oh what did the prologue have to do with the remainder of the movie and the revolver warm enough to hold in his hand froze up and wouldn t fire gimme a break well at least we have carly pope another eminently lovely canadian lass and with little irony ed marinaro as the coach well i might as well add the rabbit they ate despite it looking like chicken is not a rodent but a lagomorph now if it had been a squirrel or a rat it would have been a rodent but it still looked like chicken and the writers missed a real chance to have someone note it tastes just like
holy cow what a piece of sh t this movie is i didn t how these filmmakers could take a word book and turn it into a movie i guess they didn t know either i don t remember any farting or belching in the book do you they took this all times childrens classic added some farting belching and sexual inuindo and prostituted it into a kaka joke this should give you a good idea of what these hollywood producers think like i have to say visually it was interesting but the brilliant visual story is ruined by toilet humor if you even think that kind of thing is funny i don t want the kids that i know to think it is don t take your kids to see don t rent the dvd i hope the ghost of doctor suess ghost comes and haunts the people that made this movie
a great slasher movie too bad it was the producers and not part of the script basic plot summary man with redhead fetish goes invites such women to his flat only to go into some kind of freakish coma and proceeds in offing them to various degrees of success only the cutting crew behind the scenes must have thought the movie was as ad as i did and chopped the heck out of the movie nothing flows you get lost on which redhead he is with at the time didn t he off that one earlier and most of the time it looks like the camera man passed out and resumed filming when he awoke not that i can blame him i passed out times and had to rewind and resume to try to regain what little plot that does exist warning when you see the ending do not try to connect it with anything that happens before you will just get an aneurysm not worth the time effort or god forbid money only reason to get a instead of a the slim chance that the hacking occurred between film release and the horrible version that i watched
i bought this movie because this was shah rukh khans debut and i also liked to see how would he do i must say he is excellent in his role divya bharathi is superb in this movie rishi does a wonderful job susham seth supported well alok nath was good in his role amrish and mohnish did their parts well too dalip also was good in his small role actors shine in a mediocre movie the direction is average the editing is poor the story is boring it tells us about ravi a famous pop singer he has a lot of female fans one of them is kaajal ravi and kaajal fall in love and get married ravi gets killed by his cousins kaajal becoems a widow to escape from ravis cousins they go to bombay she comes across raja she falls in love with him and gets married ravi returns the story is predictable the climax is predictable the first half bores it also drags a lot but it is saved by the actors and music the second half entertains the music is catchy with some nice songs the cinematography looks outdated in the first half but it looks unimaginative the song picturisations are dull except for sochenge tumhe pyar and one rain song the costumes are outdated any way watch this just for the actors and music rating
dakota was another early lou diamond phillips starring vehicle this film is similar to the later released film harley there are a few differences but they re both the same i don t know which one came first i guess it ll remain one of the mysteries of life but they both are troubled kids who are trying to turn there lives around instead of bikes this one involves horses they re basically the same movie and they re both cheesy as hell if you re a serious l d p fan then i recommend that you watch them both you get some extreme mugging and posturing from l d p if you re game then go for it not recommended except for l d p fans
in the title i write that the story is ludicrous below i ll elaborate and tell you why it in my humble opinion ruins this movie gere and danes are doing their jobs and while it s not their best work it s quite ok the rest of the cast though is doing a really poor job mind you this is not entirely the actors fault the problem is that gere and danes are the only ones that have characters that have even the slightest room in the movie to really give any depth all other characters have either too little room in the movie to create any depth or the character is such a clich that it doesn t matter how hard the actors try the director has a bit of a se en complex but looking merely at the direction i think he does an ok job but the story this is the kind of script that is bad in two ways first of all it s a bad movie script the characters are shallow except for gere s and danes characters the villains are clich s and the actions of the characters is totally unbelievable besides this the writers must have an agenda where they want to bring back our views and ethics a hundred years it s the kind of movie that are saying that some criminals are still criminals regardless of the fact that they have paid the price the society has given them it s also the kind of movie that says albeit only between the lines that every form of sexual deviance should be punished without trial judge or jury and of course according to the movie everything that is not sex in the missionary position by a married couple is a sexual deviance so if you re going to film school and need an example of a bad script or if you re writing scripts yourself and want an ego boost see it for everyone else i recommend another movie
the only connection this movie has to horror is that it is horribly unentertaining i would rather prick my finger with a rusty nail than have to sit through it again even for a tv movie it is flat the cast is boring the screenplay is as exciting as a bowl of sand how two directors conspired to create such a nothing movie will remain one of the great mysteries of the th century there is only one scene even vaguely worthy of inclusion in the omen franchise and it is shot in slo mo and cut short at the anticipated pay off if you are tempted to see this pop it in set your alarm clock for minutes and get comfy with any luck you ll doze off quickly and the alarm will wake you once the worst is over namely this movie
exactly what you would expect from a b movie deritive gratuitous nudity boring in parts ridiculous gore and cheesy special effects of course it could have been better better acted defintly better written directed etc but then i guess it wouldn t have been a b movie the actors pretty much sucked in fact this pretty much seemed like an episode of buffy the vampire slayer or something except with a lot of blood profanity and nudity tiffany shepis must be singled out she absolutely is the scream queen of the new millennium not that acting really matters in these movies but she was better than any of the other actors she s also smokin hot in that plastic jump suit thing she wore for the whole movie wow her posterior is absolutely stunning in that outfit i mean it every single time she turns around you can help but check her out and near then end of the film the viewer is rewarded with seeing her completely nekked so if your a looser b movie horror buff like myself check this out if not you should probably avoid at all costs
please do not waste any money on this movie it really is nothing more than a boring german blair witch ripoff made by some high school kids i couldn t finish watching it and usually i like watching all kinds of b movies how on earth could they find a distributor for it funny however check out wikipedia for dark area the guy who wrote the entry must be completely out of his mind maybe he got loads of money from the producers money that should have been spend on actors camera and editing even that wouldn t have helped since there is absolutely no interesting idea behind this film unfortunately dark area has already gotten too much attention please director producer and author of this movie stop making movies like that you are not doing yourself a favor the world would be a better place without this film
i read comments about this being the best chinese movie ever perhaps if the only chinese movies you ve seen contained no dialogue long drawn out far away stares and silences and hack editing then you re spot on complicated story line hardly try juvenile and amateurish exquisite moods and haunting memories hardly try flat out boring and trite this was awful i could not wait for it to be over particularly when the best lines in the movie consist of how are you i m fine are you sure yes wow what depth of character i guess the incessant cigarette smoking was supposed to speak for them as a huge fan of many chinese japanese and korean films i was totally disappointed in this even zhang s sentimentally sappy the road home was better than this
it seems like anybody can make a movie nowadays it s like all you need is a camera a group of people to be your cast and crew a script and a little money and walla you have a movie problem is that talent isn t always part of this equation and often times these kind of low budget films turn out to be duds the video store shelves are filled with these so called films these aren t even guilty pleasures they re just a waste of celluloid that are better off forgotten troma entertainment is known for making trash cinema but most of their films are b movie gold however some of the films they ve put out they had nothing to do with making and some like nightmare weekend didn t deserve any form of release at all pros the cast members do the best they can with the lousy material some unintentional hilarity moves at a good pace should at minutes cons awful writing which includes putrid dialogue and countless plot holes poorly lit especially the night scenes and the ending which you can t make out at all doesn t make a lick of sense badly scored cheap and very dated effects total lack of character development and you won t care about anybody this is supposed to be a horror film but it s lacking in that area and isn t the least bit scary nothing interesting or exciting happens loaded with unnecessary padding final thoughts i never expected this to be some forgotten gem but i never imagined it would be this bad i don t know if it s the worst film ever made but it s a definite contender troma should have let this film rot instead of giving it a release don t make the same mistake i did and let your curiosity get the best of you my rating
this is a genuinely horrible film the plot such as it is is totally undecipherable i think it has something to do with blackmail but i m not entirely certain half of the dialogue consists of useless cliches the other half is spoken by the various actors in such unintelligible imitations of southern accents that thankfully the words cannot be recognized but the one true tragedy of the movie is that such a historic talent as mary tyler moore apparently was in such dire financial or personal circumstances that she appeared in it
i know that actors and actresses like to try different kinds of movies hey no one wants to get typecast but danny glover brenda fricker happy birthday brenda and christopher lloyd should have known better than this angels in the outfield is another movie in which everything seems lost until someone or something magically comes and saves the day do i even need to tell you how it ends the movie is just plain lowly escapism examples of high escapism are the various sci fi movies from the s if these movies had some political undertone or at least offered us a new look at life then they would be ok this one is just pointless far closer to diabolical than angelic also starring tony danza adrien brody and matthew mcconaughey and i suspect that they don t wish to stress this in their resumes
this film was a yawn from titles to credits it s boring to the point of tedium and the acting is wooden and stilted admittedly this was director richard jobson directing debut but who on earth green lit a script as poorly developed as this one looks like another money down the drain government project scottish screen are credited surprise surprise i nearly fell asleep three times and my review will unfortunately have to be more restrained than this one please please mister jobson what ever you ve been doing prior to directing this sedative of a film go back to it
and being let down bigger than ever before i won t make any direct references or anything here but to say the least this film is pathetic if you re military trained don t bother watching i put it on the dvd with friends wanting to watch a somewhat interesting action war flick why couldn t i just have read the reviews first already at the first bomb scene the film has huge glitches and they continue to show and become bigger and bigger my friends not connected to the military in any way spotted a couple of the filmmaker s mistakes almost as fast as i myself did and asked me if some of the things going on we re realistic well as you might have guessed they re not at all avoid this movie unless you re able to overlook these completely idiotic and re occurring mistakes being made for catching my interest at first
i went to see this film at the cinemas and i was shocked when i got in the room there was only me and my girlfriend this shouted to me that this film is not very good not to my surprise the film was dire ben affleck plays a guy who buys a family for christmas it is a very predictable narrative with him falling in love with the girl that hates him his acting is okish but for the comedy aspect of the film he is not very good the plot line is poor and the comedy almost non existent however there are some good points for example the family is falling apart and the mother is very funny i hope this review stops other people wasting their money i was very embarrassed when i came out of the room
i am usually disappointed by network movies even flix that attract big name actors are usually ruined by the tv people however this one is the worst of the worst the screenplay is weak and the acting especially that of tracey pollan is abominable i ve trudged off to see my kids high school plays and been treated to better acting pollan acts as if she is reading the script as she speaks when she tries to express fear anger or grief it s extremely hollow because of the overall quality of the production i found it difficult to take it seriously if you decide to brave this one just be prepared for a big disappointment scary things won t scare you sad things won t make you sad romance won t make you feel warm and fuzzy and you will likely be as anxious as i was to see the end arrive first to die says a lot about this movie
in sixth grade every teacher i had decided it would be a great idea to make this movie the curriculum for an entire semester every class had something to do with this terrible show we watched it in english and wrote in journals as if we were one of the characters in math we talked about charts and other sea crap in science we talked about whales which was actually somewhat interesting so this wasn t a waste of time all day everyday was torture not only that but they would subject us to this horror twice a day by making us watch it in study hall as well i could see if this was a new series or something but it was like i m still trying to block this out
i m glad the folks at imdb were able to decipher what genre this film falls into i had a suspicion it was trying to be a comedy but since it also seems to want to be a dark and solemn melodrama i wasn t sure for a comedy it is amazingly bereft of even the slightest venture into the realms of humour right up until the ridiculous twist ending which confirms what an utter waste of time the whole movie actually is it is hard to describe just how amateurish the hazing really is did anyone involved in this film have any idea at all what they were supposed to be doing actually worth watching so that you can stare at the screen in slack jawed disbelief at how terrible it is
the exclamation point in the title is appropriate albeit an understatement this movie doesn t just cry it shrieks loud enough to shatter glass filmmakers andrew and virginia stone made shrill humorless suspense thrillers that strove for a semi documentary feel here they shot on actual new york locations with tinny real life acoustics to jack up the verisimilitude but the naturalism of the sound recording only serves to amplify the stones maladroit dialog and the mouth frothing histrionics of tortured butterfly inger stevens in a performance completely devoid of modulation stevens plays the wife of electronics whiz james mason looking haggard and bored both are held captive by extortionist rod steiger looking bloated and bored and his slimy cohorts in a scheme to blackmail an airline with a deadly bomb that mason has unwittingly helped construct here is another credibility straining instance of a criminal mastermind so brilliantly attentive to every detail yet knuckleheaded enough to hire a drug addicted degenerate as an underling the stones idea of nail biting tension is to trap the hysterical stevens alone with benzedrine popping rapist neville brand filling the frame with his sweaty drooling kisser but the camera work is so leaden and brand so uncharacteristically demure that the effect is hardly lurid much less suspenseful the stones a square pair at heart don t even have the courage of their own lack of convictions the film which ends with the portly steiger chasing the fleet footed stevens on a subway train track is as clumsy as its ungainly heavy with angie dickinson as steiger s amoral girlfriend jack klugman kenneth tobey and barney philips
a bad one oh my this is one of the movies which doesn t have even one positive effect just everything from actors to story stinks to the sky i just wonder how low i q you should have to watch this kind of flick and even enjoy is there something than this is worth watching for well there is a lot of nudity involved but it s nothing particular and when you just think that it couldn t get worse your realize that all the naked ladies looked like there are forty years old c mon guys where did you search for these actresses in elderly home perhaps anyway the leading actresses has some sex appeal and knows how to show it again too bad that she is too skinny old all in all skip these one out of
judging by some of the comments in imdb i was expecting an action movie perhaps a dramatic one or a stupid one or a simple one or a comicy one but essentially an action movie whatever it is that i watched it certainly didn t feel like a movie the story is simple and straightforward even though the prologue tries to make it seem complicated take three interest groups the government the rebels a group of assassins now subtract the first they never appear in the movie then simply let one of the assassins the princess become a rogue on a revenge trip add in a rebel love interest with a guilty conscience and you ve got the ingredients but they still did not manage to turn it into a story or a movie between some random action sequences and some odd visuals trying to be sci fi on a low budget what you re left with is a feeling of emptiness the movie just does not feel like a movie but a weird incoherent boring dream avoid
if you are studying welles and want to see just how far he fell after citizen kane this film will prove it the cheap excuse of making the protagonist a self admitted dummy to explain how he might fall into such a half baked scheme fails to explain the absurd courtroom theatrics and ridiculous plot twists that eventually ensue don t be taken in by the high rating of this film in the db as i was all i can guess is that there are a lot of die hard old welles and hayworth fans out there
but it s certainly not without merit already writer director preston sturges is experimenting with unusual cinematic effects in telling his stories creating broadly drawn yet distinctive characters and situations and writing clever and sometimes unexpectedly wise and compassionate dialogue no wonder the coen brothers next movie is going to be an homage to sturges the major problem is that the plot s not all the way there yet it lacks surprise the unexpected plot twists and sudden changes of fortune that keep viewers guessing the coffee slogan is a lousy thing to hang the plot upon and the ending is thoroughly predictable frank capra does this sort of thing much better if you re new to preston sturges check out the lady eve or sullivan s travels or the miracle of morgan s creek first if you ve seen these already then go ahead and watch this one
susan swift is an appealing youngster a flower child transplanted to the s like a young susan dey but she doesn t quite have the vocal range for a demanding dramatic lead and she tends to whine still she s rather sweet and has bright eyes and a pretty smile in the coming as it was called when briefly released to theaters swift may be the reincarnation of a salem witch the flick is very low budget and borrows from so many other pictures that i gave up on it with about minutes to go it starts out strong and has some camp appeal obviously there are more serious films that deal with the salem witch trials that deserve to be seen over this one however as junk movies go it isn t too terrible the boston locales are a definite plus and the supporting cast is amusingly hammy from
imagine the worst skits from saturday night live and mad tv in one minute movie now imagine that all the humor in those bad skits is removed and replaced with stupidity now imagine something times worse got that ok now go see the underground comedy movie that vision you just had will seem like the funniest thing ever ucm is the single worst movie i ve ever seen there were a few cheap laughs very few but it was lame even if the intent of the movie was to be lame it was too lame to be funny the only reason i m not angry for wasting my time watching this was someone else i know bought it he wasted his money vince offer hasn t written or directed anything else and it s no surprise why
there s nothing wrong with a popcorn movie to keep you off the streets it s just that some are better than others this is very poor the acting is awful the script dire and the special effects overrated why does hollywood treat it s audience with such contempt and why have they made a sequel
by dane youssefa gang of crooks the perfect plan it all goes wrong they re in trouble the police are outside they re cornered what are they gonna do now sound familiar the movie seems like it s trying to be a combination of the acting workshop the indie film and the theater it s the kind of things that actors love it s kind of like a workshop or a play because it mostly consists of tight focusing on the actors acting acting angry tense scared conversing scheming planning giving the performers a lot of free range to really ham it all up a trio of crooks one leader one goon one brother come up with a big heist scheme and a monkey wrench is thrown into the works to top things off there s a bit of a fender bender and one of the crooks in flung through the back of the windshield the cops are on their tail and they stumble into a bar named poetically and leadenly dino s last chance spacey as a director tries to keep the focus on the actors performances and delivery of dialouge he pans over to a bright passion red cigarette ad of a smoking and smoldering bogart and he keeps all the violence off screen really i think that was a mistake focusing on the intensity and gruesome violent scenes would have given the movie some edge the problem with the movie is that it moves too slow and suffers from miscasting in almost every role matt dillon drugstore cowboy and wild things seems too young and too idealistic to be the leader of this gang gary sinese seems to brooding and deep in thought to be a spineless tag along with these guys and joe mantaga is effective as the traditional routine foul swearing mad dog police lieutenant who s all thumbs but he isn t given anything to really do here william fischter is the only actor who is believable in his role as a brainless grunt who just wants to spill blood and the crooks are in a tense situation where they either go to jail or they try to think of some way out of this spacey lacks the ability to create a lot of tension and keep it going the characters are mostly chatting away trying to think of a plan and they re to calm and too articulate there s even a scene where the crooks are playing pool with a whole swarm of armed cops right outside ready to strike at one point one of the crooks even call the police who are right outside the bar oh brother oh bother these cops are going to either blow them away or going to lock them up shouldn t the holed up crooks be a little scared a little uneasy meanwhile all the real action is happening inside someone whips out a gun a baseball bat which leads to an ugly confrontation off screen and there s one more casualty that happens that s well kinda sad but faye dunaway also should have spent more time with a dialect coach improving on her new orleans accent skeet ullrich is fine in a smaller part a cop listening in reaches for a pack of matches at the absolute worst time is a nice look and so is a scene where someone goes right through the rear windshield the dialouge is obviously trying to go for a david mamet approach and it s as profane but never as realistic or as insightful the movie feels like too much of what it really is a really low budget movie with an actor behind the camera for the first time directing other actors from a script that s not bad but needs a few more re writes spacey shows he s not a terrible director but he lacks a sort of feel for shaping a movie and it feels like he s just filming actors act these actors are all talented and could work with the material but they all feel out of place as i said before the movie really suffers from miscasting i don t mean that the wrong actors were cast i think they found just the right cast but placed them in all the wrong roles i think switching some of the roles would ve helped immensely having veteran mob actor joe mantagna play the leader of the pack gary sinese as the angry police lieutenant outside on his bullhorn giving orders and barking at his troops keeping fischter in his bloodthirsty goon part and matt dillion as the sacrificial lamb that would have been a big improvement when some actors direct it works they can even win oscars for it but a lot of the time when actors direct they have a tendency to just focus on the performances just shoot the actors acting sometimes it works but they need a good showcase for it an excuse for it hostage situations are all pretty much the same in real life just like coming of age stories so it s only natural that movies about them will go from point a to point b as well there are a few really great entries into this genre spacey himself appeared in a similar movie about hostage situations the negotiator this certainly won t become a cult classic let alone one of afi s still it does have a few nice moments and personal touches but in the end it s instantly forgettable and the kind of movie that would play best on regular tv it s just not worth going out of your way to see i give a out of spacey s other directorial credit beyond the sea was reportedly a better effort hmmm maybe it s true you need to fail before you succeed by dane youssef
the story concerns a genealogy researcher mel harris who is hired by her estee lauder like cosmetic queen aunt her aunt by marriage we are left to presume is trying to track down her long lost family in europe all they have to go on is a photo of a young girl standing by an ornate music box the researcher heads to europe and conducts her search in places like milan budapest and vienna the scenery is the real thing and is actually shot on location unlike a murder she wrote where jessica is supposed to be visiting a far flung locale and lansbury never left burbank anyway she meets a young man who is also searching to solve a family mystery of his own and they team up to track down clues and menace bad guys the dialogue particularly the romantic dialogue is terrible i watched this because of the scenery but the script was so bad that i stayed on just to see if it would get worse it did acting was also off i can see why mel harris s career never really took off after thirtysomething but she is adequate seems too old for her co star though but the supporting players are straight out of the community playhouse i also lost count of how many times they say budapest to each other yes it is pronounced bood a phesht we know okay i realized halfway into the film that this had to be one of those harlequin movies and sure enough it is guess that says it all
i have nothing to comment on this movie it is so bad that i had to put my first comment on imdb website to help some viewers save some time and do something more interesting instead of watching this movie anything will do even stare at the walls is better and because i have to write minimum lines of text i tell you also is a low budget movie bad acting no name actors a stupid mutt as the wolf and so on also the story brings nothing new the special effects are made in the s style the movie is almost as bad as the movie megalodon so have fun not watching this movie
my first full heston movie the movie that everyone already knows the ending to a sci fi thriller the campy factor everything that goes with this movie was injected in my head when i rented it and on the morning that i watched it it was the perfect movie to watch in the mood that i was in not wanting to move put in player hide in blankets and though i tried to understand what was happening to lead to the ending that will be eternally ruined by pop culture it just really didn t make it everything was all over the place relationships had no backbone the ending had no lead in everything was just kind of there in some freakish way and the watcher has no choice but to leave partially dumbfounded at the ending that it gets to because even though we all know that it s people it s quick answers as to why it s people makes any serious attempt at enjoying the movie for anything other than the silliness thrown out the window
the infamous ed wood classic plan from outer space features an indignant alien calling the human race stupid stupid stupid stupid i d have to say exhibit a in that trial would probably this movie a ridiculously silly sci fi film falling action star jean claude van damme returns to a hit role for him from the original movie luke a former universal soldier who now works making really good universal soldiers while van damme was too big to reprise the role in the first two sequels he was too small to do much of anything else by the time the fourth film in the universal soldier series came around so probably cursing under his breath the whole way he kicks and grunts and scowls through ninety minutes of explosions and karate kicks you ll find plenty of mindless violence but i d advise you get a coat check for your brain at the door when you start watching this thing otherwise you are liable to forget where you left it by the time it s over luke is called into action against more universal soldiers after a really really really evil computer named seth makes hal look like ghandi turns all the other universal soldiers into evil remorseless killers of course this is what these things are programmed to do but in this case they are killing their creators not the enemy so that s a problem i love the dumb logic of this movie logic that believes that a supercomputer would create a body for itself that looks as ashamed as michael jai white does to be in this movie logic that dictates that the creator of seth be a blue haired cyber stereotype geek who spouts cliches more regularly than old faithful does steam logic that has a climactic karate fight feature two characters kicking each other though ten separate panes of shattering glass in the span of three minutes of screen time the film also features a daughter in peril character wrestler bill goldberg as a wrestler disguised as a universal soldier and a romance so tacked on i have to think the writers thought tacked on romances were actually a good thing and when this movie ends it ends not a minute after a gigantic towering finale style explosion are the credits running no epilogue no where are they now no final kiss just explosion hug over even the creators want to get out of this thing as soon as possible while it s no plan us tr is a silly little trifle of an action movie that would be fun at parties full of rowdy van damme fans who enjoy seeing their hero really reaching new depths not to be seen on a serious stomach
it seems as if in science fiction you have this periodic throwback to perform an odd phenomenon that appears in long serial novels it s where the first novel dune ender s game blows you away with an actionpacked revolutionary story the sequels however take that universe and lead you down the garden path to whatever new little social or political commentary the author wants to make the matrix is finally the film equivalent the matrix stands tall alone as an interesting film with an odd twist in the middle seeing this cash cow just sitting there and wanting to explore other aspects of society the writers and directors then lead you through what has to be some of the most painful monologues and non action sequences in scifi while the visuals remain as stunning from the first movies the new explorations of the characters falls terrible flat in the sequel watch for eye candy not for deep thought out of as registered by this fine website
while not quite as monstrously preposterous as later works this slow moving repetitive giallo offers some nice touches in the first half but grows more and more lethargic and silly as it stumbles to its lame denouement to be sure the actors are above average considering this is an argento movie and some moments show the director s visual skills but whole sequences should ve been cut and basically it s just the same exploitative trash as ever wallowing in fake science and abnormal sexual depravity out of genetic disorders
outlandish premise that rates low on plausibility and unfortunately also struggles feebly to raise laughs or interest only hawn s well known charm allows it to skate by on very thin ice goldie s gotta be a contender for an actress who s done so much in her career with very little quality material at her disposal
look there s nothing spectacularly offensive about this film it s just boring it s a typical rom com with an ending you can see coming before you ve seen so much as the trailer the key difference is that the classic rom coms tackle their stories with wit and a lack of pretension this movie has no pretension but it really has no sense of movement you feel as though you could get up and walk away at any moment the production of the movie also has the feel of a debut movie made about fifteen years ago i d recommend re watching a classic movie like when harry met sally instead of this shallow imitation oh one other big problem no chemistry if you re used to seeing michael looking all cute as vaughn in alias you re going to be seriously disappointed with the way they ve made him look here
the opening minutes gave me hope then meyers proved he only had one good idea for the rest of the movie absolute lowest common denominator humor painful viewing a complete chore written no doubt in less than a week just like the first one give meyers the hook and lock him in a cell with adam sandler and will farrell and don t let him out until he s developed a decent script for something anything he has it in him these austin powers things are just embarrassing let goldmember sink without trace
the same night that i watched this i also watched scary movie making for one messed up double feature unfortunately for these killer tomatoes they could not stand up to the laugh riot that is the scary movie franchise while i fought boredom here watching jokes that were silly and stupid brutally dated and brutally bad the more recent parody had me laughing out loud how could i desire any more than that director john de bello uses the basic premise that some sort of growth hormone has gone terribly wrong and turned the tomatoes into killers but his main objective here is to slap around the disaster movie genre that was so big back in the day the script reeks of stoner humor and perhaps if you take illegal substances with your movie nights this could be your cup of tea i sober was stuck watching a grown man go under cover as a tomato and that one joke that is never funny where the discrepancy between the japanese speaking actor and the voice over is also here some may giggle i did not they even had a hitler joke that wasn t funny and i thought all hitler jokes were funny the narrative of this film is so splintered for no good reason that it is nearly impossible to explain tomatoes kill people the government tries to stop it bad jokes are told their aim may have been correct as their targets include the media consumerism and paranoia three things that still control our lives today oddly enough the main selling point of this film those gosh darn tomatoes really don t make much of an appearance and when they do get this they re played by real tomatoes that washed up gimmick did nothing for me as i get very little out of watching a pack of tomatoes devour a body thanks to the magic of stop action camera tricks there is also a fear of going for broke at work here that prevents this film from being truly funny the gag of having somebody fall asleep in nearly every scene may please some audience members but more than likely it will be seen as an invitation to join in the fun i might also add that there does seem to be some old fashioned human egotism at work here man eats tomato and that s dinner tomato eats man and that is a worldwide catastrophe but that is just the way the world works in the film the produce becomes evil because of genetic modification but in the real world our produce see taco bell becomes evil thanks to neglect and like those evil doin green onions this film s shelf life expired a long time ago there are a few good chuckles to be had the last shot was really quite splendid but it was nowhere near enough to save this moderate stink bomb i m pretty sure there is a good movie buried deep within this concept but the script needed to be filtered through about a dozen rewrites to get there and by there i mean to the level of scary movie
this film is the worst film but it ranks very high for me it is how a slasher movie should be it takes place at a university in which there only seems to be a handful of students the teachers are dumber than a sack of hammers it is filled with good catholic priest sexually repressed humor bad hair bad clothes the dialogue is so cliched it is hard to believe that i was able to predict lines in quotes the slashings have some creativity and seem to revolve around stabbing people in the genitalia a lack of continuity in the soundtrack and characters that deserve to die because they are so bad i recommend this film for a fun time get a case of cheap beer and some friends watch it and laugh
watching this movie made me think constantly why are they making such a problem out of some broken brakes there are a million options to slow down the car in the movie speed the writers a least thought of a good reason why the car wasn t able to stop there aren t many good things to say about this film all the usual narrative cliche s make their appearance the actors are very bad the story is as leak as a sieve etc that makes this movie a waste of time and money
rating out of as this mini series approached and we were well aware of it for the last six months as sci fi channel continued to pepper their shows with bg ads i confess that i felt a growing unease as i learned more as with any work of cinematic art which has stood up to some test of time different people go to it to see different things in this regard when people think of battlestar galactica they remember different things for some it is the chromium warriors with the oscillating red light in their visor for others it is the fondness that they held for special effects that were quite evolutionary for their time many forget the state of special effects during the late s especially those on television for some the memories resolve around the story arc others still remember the relationships how how the relationships themselves helped overcome the challenges that they faced frankly i come from the latter group the core of battlestar galactica was the people that pulled together to save one another from an evil empire yes evil the cylons had nothing to gain but the extermination of the human race yet they did it while base stars were swirling around men and women came together to face an enemy with virtually unlimited resources and somehow they managed to survive until the next show they didn t survive because they had better technology or more fire power they survived because they cared for and trusted each other to get through to the next show the show had its flaws and at times was sappy but they were people you could care about the writers of this current rendition seemed to never understand this in some ways he took the least significant part of the original show the character s names and a take on the story arc and crafted what they called nothing less than a reinvention of television science fiction since that was their goal they can be judged on how well they accomplished it failure it was far from a reinvention in fact it was in many ways one of the most derivitive of science fiction endeavors in a long time it borrows liberally from st tng st ds babylon and even battlefield earth i find that unfortunate ronald d moore has been a contributor to popular science fiction for more than a decade and has made contribution to some of the most popular television science fiction that you could hope to see one of the difficulties that he appears to have had was that there could be no conflict in the bridge crew of the enterprise d e that was the inviolable rule of roddenberry s st tng like many who have lived under that rules of others who then take every opportunity to break the rules when they are no longer under that authority ron moore seems to have forgotten some of the lessons he learned under the acknowledged science fiction master gene roddenberry here instead of writing the best story possible he has created a dysfuntional cast as i have ever seen with the intent of creating as much cast conflict as he could besides being dysfunctional some of it was not the least bit believable anyone who has ever been in the military knows that someone unprovokedly striking a superior officer would not get just a couple of days in hack they could have gotten execution and they never would have gotten out the next day it wouldn t have happened period especially in time of war the thing that i remembered most of ron moore s earlier work was that he was the one who penned the death of capt james kirk he killed capt kirk and alas for me he has killed battlestar galactica
i ve read comments that you shouldn t watch this film if you re looking for stirring shakespearian dialogue this is true unfortunately because all the stirring dialogue this wonderful play contains has been cut and replaced with songs i ve read this play and recently was lucky enough to see it performed at it remains one of my favourite shakespearian comedies but this movie seems to take all that i like about it away the princess though no doubt doing what she was directed to do had no regal bearing and all the girls seemed to lose the cleverness of their characters also affected by unwise cuts which not only took away the female characters already sparse dialogue but took comments out of context it was a little unnerving to hear the princess proclaim we are wise girls to mock our lovers so when mocking had not taken place at all the news reels throughout the film also disrupted the flow and took away many excellent scenes as they showed the information in the scenes after them and were in modern phrasing in conclusion an excellent play ruined by an odd concept and unwise cuts kenneth i usually love what you do what were you thinking
daphne zuniga is the only light that shines in this sleepy slasher and the light fades quickly if not her than what other reason to watch this five college kids are signed up to prepare an old dorm for its due date of demolition problems are automatically occurring when a weird homeless man is soliciting and the group are short a few people then a killer is on the loose i honestly wanted to say i was going to enjoy this one it had a fair set up or maybe that was just daphne zuniga in it the film is too slow and almost as silent as a library most of the acting is below average and the point of view moments are so old news acclaimed composer christopher young of such films as hellraiser and entrapment scored this in a repetitive cue line that was better made for a tv movie still it seems higher than the movie deserves so other than young and zuniga this one scrapes the bottom of the barrel
bad movie it s too complicated for young children and too childish for grown ups i just saw it because i m a robin williams fan and i was very disappointed
anyone who could find redeeming value in this piece of crap ought to have their head examined we have the submissive heroin addicted part time hooker wife with lacerations all over her body lacerations received from repeated beatings by an abusive son now she is squirting breast milk all over the kitchen floor the release so gained somehow akin to helen keller placing her hands in running water we have the husband who starts out by patronizing a prostitute who just happens to be his daughter she s upset with him because he came too quickly and ends by murdering his female colleague having sex with her corpse and then chopping her up we have the kid who is relentlessly bullied by his classmates and who comes home and beats his mom you see it s all circular deep huh the only decent moment in this horrendous pile of tripe is when the dad murders his son s tormentors it s a good thing this turkey was shot on video because otherwise what a waste of expensive film it would be if that guy who thinks artists ought to be interested in this slop is really serious no wonder most people think artists are insane we saw this lousy movie then put on zero woman the accused oh my god it was a tossup as to which one was worse what is going on in japan these days sick sick sick
a number of brides are mysteriously murdered while at the altar and later their bodies are stolen en route to the morgue newspaper writer patricia hunter decides to investigate these mysterious killings she discovers that right before each ceremony the bride was given a rare orchid supposedly from the groom which contained a powerful drug that succumbed them patricia is told that the orchid was first grown by a dr lorenz who lives in a secluded estate with his wife in reality dr lorenz is responsible for the crimes by putting the brides in a suspended state and using their gland fluid to keep his wife eternally young patricia along with dr foster who is working with dr lorenz on the medical mystery surrounding his wife try to force dr lorenz s hand by setting up a phony wedding which eventually leads patricia into the mad doctor s clutches this movie had a very good opening reel but basically ended up with too many establishing shots and other weak scenes the cast is decent walters and coffin deserved better but that s life russell steals the show even out hamming lugosi who does not give one of his more memorable performances even considering his monograms as countess lorenz playing the role with the qualities of many of the stereotypical characteristics of many of today s hollywood prima donnas weak and contrived ending as well rating based on b movies
seriously i absolutely love these old movies and their simplicity but i just watched this for the first time last night and it easily slotted itself into my bottom five of all time was this supposed to be about the love story or the zombies this movie was so bad that after it mercifully ended all i could do is laugh at how ridiculously bad it really was thankfully i m too anal to turn a movie off without seeing the entire thing or i wouldn t be able to brag about watching this all the way through in one sitting i like to think something positive can be said about anything in life so in keeping with that theory i will acknowledge this film s most positive asset it was very short for a full length film
this film was very well advertised i am an avid movie goer and have seen previews for this movie for months while i was somewhat skeptical of how funny this movie would actually be my friends thought it was going to be great and hyped me up about it then i went and saw it i was sunk down in my seat almost asleep until i remembered that i had paid for this movie i made myself laugh at most of the stuff in the movie just so i wouldnt feel bad and destroy the good mood i was in plus i wanted to get my monies worth out of the movie i always go into a movie with an open mind not trying to go into them with too many expectations but this movie was not that funny now it wasnt the worst movie i ve ever seen but it is definitely worth waiting for hbo if you havent seen many previews for the movie or you like very slow and corny comedies you may enjoy it but for true comedy fans id say pass maybe even check out the kings of comedy again something told me to go see meet the parents instead
columbo movies have been going downhill for years this year it may have reached the bottom peter falk gives the same uninspired performance and comes over as creepy in this movie as is usual in this series crime scene protocols are unheard of so plausibility is always lacking brenda vaccaro chews the scenery and pulls pantomime faces and andrew stephens is a pretty unconvincing lady s man his faint though was a hoot the script was by the numbers and its delivery patronising they should never have brought columbo into the nineties just left us all with one or two happy memories of clever plots better scripts and sharp characterisations
this could have been the gay counterpart to gone with the wind given its epic lenght but instead it satisfied itself by being a huge chain of empty episodes in which absolutely nothing occurs the characters are uni dimensional and have no other development in the story there s actually no story either than looking for each other and kissing it s a shame that an interesting aesthetic proposition like having almost no dialog is completely wasted in a film than makes no effort in examining the psychology of its characters with some dignity and achieving true emotional resonance on top of that it pretends to be an art film by using the worst naive clich s of the cinematic snobbery but anyway if someone can identify with its heavy banality i guess that s fine
if it were not for the oh so gourgous natassia malthe this b movie would not have been worth one sector of my tivo disk space in what low rent back lot warehouse was the supposed space port filmed in continuity people it s a basic principle in real movie making by night an alleged space port and by day night and day on a space station a warehouse people please the only thing i will commend this movie for is the wardrobe dept for continuously keeping natassia in those tight shape revealing outfits even the women who saw this bomb had to appreciate the outfits that she obviously spent some time getting into each day of filming the sci fi channel would have been better off showing spaceballs at least there would have been some real humor in watching something so unbelievable p s michael ironside please fire your agent asap you are so much better of an actor to be even associated with this level of movie making
i was not nearly as smitten with this as many other reviewers sure it has a pair of lovely girls playing erotic lesbian vampires marianne morris and anulka d play these two lovely sirens with razor teeth that run up to cars on a road out of the way hitch to their home at dusk and invite their prey sex starved men to their boudoir what happens there well after they disrobe and kiss each other mostly they kill their visitors director jose ramon larraz does have some flashes of brilliance with his camera some scenes are quite eerie and effectively shot but sex alone does not hold a film up no pun intended at least consciously there really isn t much of a story here we have the two girls we are shown some inexplicable and unexplained beginning where we see them shot with pistol why what does it mean why do we have the guy that stays for several days greet a guy at the hotel that insists he knows him from years ago does that have a purpose of course i have even more general questions like what is a couple of nice looking girls doing as vampires in the english countryside and having a wine cellar filled with wine from the carpathians anyway the script is riddled with such flaws it is also very sparse on the action outside of catch victims wine and dine them quite literally and then go to bed in the crypt the end gets going with some juicier scenes but it is anti climatic there are as i said some effective scenes by the director i particularly liked the way the girls dressed and were filmed in the woods looking for their prey the house is also a most impressive set and both girls are as i said very lovely marianne morris in particular stands out in more ways than one for you older film fans silent screen veteran bessie love has a brief cameo at film s end
why do all movies on lifetime have such anemic titles an unexpected love ooh how provocative this much i know would have been better the film is nothing special real people don t really talk like these characters do and the situations are really hackneyed the straight woman who turns lesbian seemed more butch than the lesbian character if you wanna watch two hot women kiss in a very discreet fashion you might enjoy this although it seems like it was written by someone who doesn t really get out in the world to observe people why am i wasting my time writing about it
this film has a special place in my heart as the worst movie i have ever seen it is about as fun as doing hard manual labor with stomach cramps the movie starts out bad i would rate the first few minutes of the film a and then it get progressively worse minute by minute the only way to rate it at all would be some kind of abyssmal spiraling negative number that grows for ninety long minutes unfunny is not a real word but it best describes the humor in this video somehow the video manages even to make cute scantily clad females and sex look grotesque and distasteful this movie is amazingly bad i would say it would be better to be locked up with the titanic theme playing over and over and with buscemi s character from escape from la droning on in your ear than to watch this movie the sequels are not nearly as bad if you have to rent a troma film get tromeo and juliette or combat shock i would rather watch tony little infomercials back to back than to see class of nukem high again don t get me wrong it took some kind of criminal genius to make a movie this terrible and if ever a movie deserved an award for being awful this is it
very bad film very very very bad film it s a rarity but it defenitly is not worth hunting down this italian jaws rip off makes little sense most of the time and no sense the rest the alligator is not at all convincing and many of the sub plots go nowhere if it s at the local video store you may want to watch it if you re a fan of monster movies but it s not worth hunting down
this could have been a rather entertaining film but instead it ranks with other duds like leeches and rest in pieces at the bottom of the cinematic food chain had they played this flick tongue in cheek it could have been a very entertaining film like re animator or dead alive but juan piquor simon plays it tongue in cheek in spots but straight more often the premise of this film is a small community that is besieged by mutated slugs there is an abandoned toxic waste dump near a sewer line that mutates the slugs into aggressive meat eating monsters albeit monsters that move slowly and can be squished under your boot health inspector michael garfiled and two accomplices are the only people that seem willing to fight the slugs while the sheriff and mayor think they are crazy the climax is a laugh riot unintentional at that which makes you scratch your head as to how stupid actors and screenwriter the scenario of destroying the slugs is story no new ground charted here simon seems to play the gore elements tongue in cheek but the dialogue is straight had simon worked with a clever script one with plenty of one liners and eccentric characters this could have been a cult film violence you won t be letdown here we get plenty of exploding chest cavity scenes as well as a grand head explosion in the middle of a fine italian restaurant the blood and guts that many horror film watchers enjoy is in full swing here you also get corpses of people who have been picked clean by the slugs and plenty of slug smashing scenes acting wow michael garfield seems to know that this script is a stinker and he delivers his lines with a facial expression that suggests he knows how preposterous this film making endeavor is kim terry as his wife does an adequate job even though she does little beyond the hold your face while you scream bit the teenagers were all horrible actors no exceptions man this film could have used bruce dern or jeffrey combs nudity two teens get naughty in bed before they get dispatched in a poorly done scene by a horde of slugs that crawled into the girl s bedroom both male and female nudity here
this is the only film i ve seen that is made by uwe boll i knew that he is probably the worst director ever who always makes films based on video games also that house of the dead is one of imdb bottom but i still wanted to watch it because i m a huge fan of the game and i wanted to see what doe s the film have that makes it so bad after watching it i do agree that it is crap the movie had no story in the first minutes there was nothing but topless teenage girls with no brains running about for a moment there i was wondering are the zombies brain dead or the girls are then at night time the zombies popped out of nowhere started attacking people later a woman started shooting them i mean it takes you one place then the other every minutes is it supposed to be a comedy or horror or both before i knew it i fell asleep at the second half woke up during the end credits so i did not manage to watch all of it which is a good thing the film is a true insult to the classic game uwe boll please do not make any more films thank you
joe don baker he was great in walking tall and had a good bit part in goldeneye but here in final justice all hope is gone the dark side has won as with most of humanity my main experience with this one was on mst k and what an experience it was mike and the robots dig their claws deep into baker s ample flesh and skewer this flick completely it s obvious they were just beginning with mitchell on their anti joe don kick and here lies their continuation on a theme it makes for a funny experience though there are plenty of choice riffs my favorites john rhys davies for sale it s meatloaf texas ranger none of them are sponge worthy why was she wearing her prom dress to bed and my favorite son of a what what was he the son of son of a preacher man by itself final justice is as joe don puts it in the movie a big fat nada but here it actually has some entertainment value you get a chance catch this version of final justice two stars for final justice ten for the mst k version only oh and try not to visit malta when joe don s in town
i saw this movie a few days ago what the hell was that i like movies with brian o halloran they are funny and enjoyable when i saw a name of this title and genre i thought great this one could be really good some parody for slashers or another gore movies but then i read a preview and thought right it could be good anyway but it wasn t my opinion if like movies they look little bit like documentary with little bit of comedy try some moore s movies or alien autopsy they are really about something this one was empty and put a comedy to title no comment really bad joke
first a technical review the script is so slow it is really a minute story blown up to hour min the dialogue is so flat and truly one dimensional the acting is pathetic they seem to really have lifted schoolchildren out of class to read a few lines from an idiot board as for the whole point of the story namely war is bad oh there s a shock is really non existent without out the lets shock em and get great publicity scene nobody would be talking about this film it is so bad it actually bothers me to think what better things the money used this could have gone on believe me i ve seen some bad emperor s new clothes films but the one thing i can say for them is at least they were well shot and well made while the camera wobbled during two scenes in this read all the other reviews avoid at all costs and don t talk about it
whether any indictment was intended must be taken into consideration if in the year there were still rifts of feeling between caucasian and afro americans in georgia such as shown in this film obviously there remains a somewhat backward mentality among a lot of people out there it is rather hypocritical to say the least if everyone adores halle berry whoopie goldberg beyonc noemi campbell denzel washington will smith et al whilst out in the backs there persist manifest racial divides white grandmother suddenly gets black grand daughter thrust upon her only to meet up with black grandfather in a very white social backwater the story is sweet not lacking tragic overtones and eminently predictable as in most of these kinds of tv films though the final scene has you guessing will he won t he gena rowlands in her typical style offers a sincere rendering and louis gossett is a good match for her the little penny bae fortunately does not steal the show a nice way of relaxing after sunday lunch without having to force your mind too much though you might just find yourself having a little siesta in the middle of it
this is quite possibly the worst movie of all time it stars shaquille o neil and is about a rapping genie apparently someone out there thought that this was a good idea and got suckered into dishing out cash to produce this wonderful masterpiece the movie gets out of
in what would be his first screenplay based on his own short story turn about william faulkner delivers a bizarre story of loyalty sacrifice and really strange relationships the story originally was about only the tone young and cooper characters but mgm needed to put joan crawford in another picture to fulfill her contract and faulkner obliged by creating a female role crawford insisted that her lines be written in the same clipped style as her co stars young and tone leading to much unintentional hilarity as these three communicate in a telegraph like shorthand that sounds like a monty python sketch wuthering heights performed in semaphore seriously the almost entirely pronoun less sentences make ernest hemingway read like henry james the film also reflects some familiar faulkner themes with an almost unnaturally close relationship between brother and sister as may be found in his sanctuary and elsewhere when young proposes to crawford in tone s presence in lieu of an engagement ring all three exchange their childhood engraved rings with one another the closeness of tone and young is also noticeable especially as they go off to their thelma louise fate frankly it s creepy not as creepy to this new yorker however as the recurring theme of the massive cockroach wellington which crawford cheerfully catches and which is shown gamboling over her hands i had to turn away and young turns into a gladiator blech that being said there are some nice performances young is particularly engaging in a scene where he s taken up in cooper s fighter plane and roscoe karns is delightful as cooper s flying buddy tone despite his inability to express himself through realistic dialogue has a nice moment dashing away his own furtive tears over his buddy young s fate crawford stripped of meaningful dialogue as well mostly comes across as either wooden or melodramatic which is quite a balancing act for one role the battle scenes not surprisingly for a howard hawks film are the most exciting part of the entire picture but not enough as far as i m concerned this is minutes of my life i m never going to get back
it s a good thing the score came along for marlon brando as a farewell performance because i d hate to think of him going out on free money not what his fans ought to remember him by brando in his last years is looking more like orson welles and free money is the kind of film welles would have done looking for financing of his own work brando is the warden of a local prison which in america when it s located in a small rural setting is usually the largest employer in the area that gives one who is in charge a lot of clout unfortunately he has one weakness he indulges his two twin bimbos otherwise known as daughters even when they get simultaneously pregnant by a pair of losers charlie sheen and thomas haden church their hearts still belong to daddy not to fear because brando s willing to give them jobs in the prison where they work under conditions not much better than the convicts have what to do but commit a robbery of a train which goes through the locality every so often carrying used money to be burned by the treasury although free money has some moments of humor for most of the time it s quite beneath the talents of all those involved some of them would include donald sutherland as an equally corrupt judge and mira sorvino as his stepdaughter but also straight arrow fbi agent of course these people and the rest of the cast got to work with someone who many rate as the greatest american actor of the last century were it not for brando s presence and were it some years earlier free money would be playing the drive in circuit in red state america where the populace could see how they re being satirized or a feeble attempt is made to satirize them
i bought this at tower records after seeing the info mercial about fifteen hundred times on comedy central i was actually really looking forward to watching this my god where did i go wrong now before i give my review let me just say that i am a person who can pretty much find the good in all movies hell i own over dvd s with that said the underground comedy movie ranks up there with the worst film i have ever seen i tried to give it a chance but not only was it not funny it had no point did not offend what so ever and was all around stupid god who in their right mind thought these pieces of crap were funny this is going right to the bottom of the bin
ok so obviously ppl thought this was a good movie in i pity the fools who still think so its absolute rubbish the story is just ridiculous the characters are absurd caricatures but this film is not meant to satirise im sure its meant to be a serious drama isn t it dean and others are too old for their parts people say dean is great in this film and well maybe he did play his part as well as he possibly could ve his character is meant to be or or so but dean was a year old man when he made this film seeing him agonise and throw little tantrums like a year old boy its pathetic natalie wood is gorgeous but the early scenes at the police station where she is crying and whining are very unconvincing it sets a bad precedent for the film and for the rest of it you feel like cringing every time one of these badly acted emotional scenes comes along it may ve been good for its time but really its drivel it must ve just been hype about dean s death that has over inflated the reputation of this film
don t get me wrong i assumed this movie would be stupid i honestly did i gave it an incredibly low standard to meet the only reason i even saw it was because there were a bunch of girls going different story for a different time as i began watching i noticed something this film was terrible now there are two types of terrible there s freddy vs jason terrible where you and your friends sit back and laugh and joke about how terrible it is and then there is a movie like this the cat in the hat failed to create even a momentary interest in me as i watched the first bit of it not only was i bored senseless but i felt as though i had in some way been violated by the horrendousness of said movie mike myers is usually brilliant i love the majority of his work but something in this movie didn t click one of the things that the director producers writers whatevers changed was that they refused to use any of the colors of the original book red black white on any character but the cat coincidentally or not they also refused to capture any of the original and i hate to use this word but it fits zaniness of the original the book was like an ice cream sunday colorful and delicious and the movie was about as bland and hard to swallow as sawdust avoid this like a leprous prostitute
the house of the dead was the worst movie i have ever seen between the pathetic matrix camera angle attemps and the cheesy acting i fell asleep i don t think that the director and set manager could decide whether it was raining or not because there would be rain on one side of the boat and not the other i would rate this movie a out of being the best being the worst also jumping scenes from the movie to the game was really annoying it makes you wonder if they were just making up for lose time i beg anyone who reads this not to see it it s not worth the time
van damme what else can i say bill goldberg there we go now we know this movie is going to be really horrible i saw the first five minutes of this movie on tbs knowing it would be bad but not even i thought it would be this bad the plot is awful van damme is getting old finally but unlike arnold his movies are as well forget this movie don t see it ever i wouldn t even be paid to see this film stars at its heart lies a wonderful action packed thrill ride well maybe not but the marketers would sure like us to think so wouldn t they john ulmer
it was a sunday night and i was waiting for the advertised movie on tv they said it was a comedy the movie started minutes passed after that minutes and i didn t laugh not even once the fact is that the movie ended and i didn t get even on echance to laugh please someone tickle me i lost minutes for nothing
i don t think this movie was rated correctly i took my copy and blacked out the pg rating and wrote down r i would not recommend this for anyone under or whatever the r limit is why it contains a scene in the jungle with several topless indian women i don t know about you but that s not something for little children to be watching true it might be the traditional clothing style of the african indians but i think partial nudity should give a movie an r rating i haven t seen the movie recently but i guess otherwise it was alright
i rented end game having never heard of it but i m fond of political thrillers so i thought i d give it a shot after doing some research on the movie i found that it had initially been intended for theatrical release but instead had gone strait to dvd after seeing it i m thinking no wonder the movie is shocking in its unoriginality the plot and the characters are perfunctory i figured out whodunnit by the half way mark but the ending was a curve ball i have to say i didn t expect it to end quite the way it did but that s not a point in its favor the more predictable ending would have been preferable to one that is so bad perhaps the film makers saw how predictable the film was and so they decided to throw in a twist even one that made the movie even worse stay away i want the and my minutes back
this film is a travesty no wait an abomination no wait this is without a doubt the absolute worst film ever made featuring beloved characters created and established by other actors i thought inspector clouseau with alan arkin instead of peter sellers was ludicrous and sacrilegious but even daring to remake stan laurel and oliver hardy is asinine and money grubbing mr laurel and mr hardy have been dead respectively since and why anyone would even begin to imagine that suitable updates for l h would be in the persona of bronson pinchot and gailard sartain is beyond me i tuned in fully expecting to be horrified and embarrassed and i certainly wasn t disappointed everyone involved in this pathetic moronic disgrace should be blackballed from anything and everything associated with hollywood and film making avoid this movie at all costs you have been duly warned
with a tendency to repeat himself wenders has been a consistent disappointment ever since he hit it big with paris texas land of plenty is no exception taking into the fact that i anticipated an average mediocre film even before i went in wenders ambitions seem to always get the better of him it s taken for grated now his films are heavy handed and bombastic i weren t sure if i was watching a comedy that mocks middle america or some thriller the outcome of diehl s character is wholly predicable wender s insistence on layering many many scenes with some rock song is also intensely annoying he was covering up the holes in his script and direction by jazzing up the scenes i am certain that many people will find this film important and resonant but in all honestly this clumsy and didactic effort only speaks of poor direction interesting that wenders professed that while making paris texas he had great help from sam sheppard with the script yes that was wenders best and he should understand now he needs a good scriptwriter his films from the past years were a total mess
another double noir on one disc from warner home video and by far the better of the two movies is rko s marvellous thriller where danger loves this is a memorable classic with a great cast in robert mitchum faith domergue and claude rains crisply photographed in black white by nicholas musuraca it was tightly directed by john farrow where danger lives is a prime example of the noir style of picture making and will always be remembered for its stylish craftsmanship that was hollywood s past see my full review unfortunately none of the above praise can be applied to the second movie on the disc the abysmal mgm stinker tension poorly written allen rivkin and directed by john berry this movie is full of ludicrous characterisations and unlikely situations the inconceivable relationship between a mild mannered and wimpish pharmacist blandly played by richard baseheart and his overtly floozy wife a risible audrey totter is totally implausible and unconvincing how on earth they ever got together in the first place is anybody s guess then when she unsurprisingly ditches him for one of her playmates lloyd gough our timid pharmacist instead of being euphoric and over the moon with his new found good fortune plots revenge and attempts to kill gough but at the last minute chickens out the guy gets murdered anyway and our pharmacist is immediately suspected by homicide detective barry sullivan another bland performance so who did kill him well at this stage of the movie you really couldn t care less since it is all so badly executed and rendered ridiculous by director berry mr berry has no idea of pacing and is unable to inject even a smidgen of style into the thing there is nothing he can put in front of the camera that will prevent you from nodding off the only tension contained in this movie is in the rubber band that is stretched to its limit and snaps in the fingers of barry sullivan as he gives the intro at the film s opening so much for that a most unfortunate effort c est la vie best things about this turkey is the smooth monochrome cinematography by the great harry stradling an effective score by a young andre previn and an early dramatic appearance by the lovely cyd charisse before she found her dancing shoes hey maybe she could have saved the picture had she given us a few steps and a couple of pirouettes huh in its favour however are the heaps of extras that are included which boasts trailers commentaries and featurettes for both films but the disc is worth it alone for the rko mitchum classic
just watched this after hearing about how bad it was and wanted to see for myself seriously even if you read all the negative comments on here you will be nowhere near able to comprehend how awful this film actually is although it has to be one of the most hilarious things i have ever seen never bothered to post a comment on here before but this piece of crap really warrants it firstly the entire plot is ridiculous and nonsensical brother of the lead character either ben or arthur i forget which is which and frankly it s never very clear wants to stop some kind of gay marriage by killing everyone in sight because homosexuality is abhorrent to christians but apparently mass murder isn t then there s some other crap thrown in about one of the gay couple s ex wife trying to force him to remarry her at gunpoint this leads to nothing but provides us with one of the funniest lines of dialogue in the whole film i don t make sense you don t make sense that s who makes sense brilliant then there s the acting which is just atrocious it must be seen to be believed my personal favourite is the apparently stoned civil rights lawyer woman who is clearly reading her lines off of something yet still managing to mess them up enough said the gay couple couldn t be less convincing there s the vaguely attractive and completely gormless guy and his boyfriend who looks like that little cartoon dough man of the bisto adverts only fatter and less talented the film has also been filmed by someone who is incapable of holding a camera even remotely still and the number of mistakes throughout is amazing the whole thing kicks off with the fat main guy in bed with a pair of boots on yep but anyways we all know how terrible this thing is so i d like to highlight some of the most priceless comedy moments that the film provides when the fat guy sets the church on fire and then prances like a six year old girl across the car park to make his escape hilarious mildread no idea what relation she is to the main characters sometimes they know her sometimes they don t but she pops up in a couple of scenes nonetheless hilarious the stoned lawyer already mentioned her but she s so funny she s worth another mention the evil brothers dinner of crackers that he lays on for his guests the evil brother s anti gay potion the evil brother s cats the ending which i won t give away because it must be seen to be believed i warn you though make sure you re not eating at the time the tub of lard main character director producer gets naked it s foul basically ben and arthur is indescribably bad but unintentionally the most comical thing you ll see for a long time literally nothing is good about this excuse for a film the goon of a director even manages to make the opening credits into a joke by writing his own name about times
this is the kind of movie that leaves you with one impression story writing is what movie making is about incredible visual effects very good acting especially from shue everything is perfect except the story is just poor and so everything fails picture this if you had the power to be invisible what would you do well our mad scientist here played by kevin bacon could think of no other thing to do but fondle and rape women this is all his supposedly genius mind could think of does he try to gain extra power no he doesn t even bother research a way to get back to being visible the guy is basically a sex crazed maniac add to that the lab atmosphere you have all these young guys throwing around jokes like they were in a bar if it wasn t for all the white coats and equipment you would think this is a bad imitation of cheers very shallow and poor personalities and very little care is put into making you think these guys are anything but lambs for the hollow man s wolf even as a thriller the movie falls way short because most of the thrilling scenes are written out so poorly and are full of illogical behaviors by the actors that are just screaming this is just a stupid thing i have to do so that the hollow man can find me alone and kill me if you read the actual book while the scientist cane goes after women there is a lot of mental manipulation and disturbing thought that goes into his character in the movie cane is just the sick guy who goes to a crowded marketplace to rub his body in women and get off on it just sad
quite possibly the worst movie i ve ever seen i was ready to walk out after the first ten minutes the only people laughing in the theater were the tweeners don t get me wrong i love silly stupid movies just as much as the next gal but the whole premise writing and humor stunk it seemed to me that they were going for a napoleon dynamite feel strange and random scenes which would lead to a cult audience instead it ended up being forced awkward and weird the only bright light was isla fisher and i just felt utterly awful that she and sissy spacek had signed up for this horrible thing thank gosh i didn t pay for it
come on get over with the pakistan bashing guys bollywood can not only make brilliant movies but can seriously affect a generation of viewers i am a huge bollywood fan but anti pakistan movies just make me wince too much to enjoy screenplay cinematography action sequences everything i m really happy to see that viewers on both sides of the border are rejecting propaganda and there are movies like main hoon na out there that have done brilliantly not only because they deserved to because of the quality of its bollywood masala but also because it tries to say give peace a chance and shows that there are crazies out there on both sides who do not represent the masses
paul naschy made a great number of horror films in terms of quality they tend to range from fairly good to unwatchable trash and unfortunately horror rises from the tomb is closer to the latter the plot is just your average story of a witch wizard or as is the case here warlock who is put to death but not before swearing vengeance on those who did it etc etc we then get a s ance and one thing leads to another and pretty soon the executed warlock is up to no good again the plot is slow painfully boring and the film constantly feels pointless the characters string out reams of diatribe and it never serves the film in any way whatsoever paul naschy wrote the script and if you ask me he should stick to acting because the dialogue is trite in the extreme and only serves to make the film even more boring than it already is carlos aured who also directed naschy in blue eyes of the broken doll and curse of the devil provides dull direction here which likes the dialogue does nothing to help the film sometimes crap films like this have a certain charm about them but horror rises from the tomb doesn t even have that this is a painfully boring film that has little or nothing in the way of interest
it s hard to praise this film much the cgi for the dragon was well done but lacked proper modelling for light and shadow also the same footage is used endlessly of the dragon stomping through corridors which becomes slightly tedious i was amazed to see marcus aurelius in the acting credits wondering what an ex emperor of the roman empire was doing acting in this film like whoopie goldberg it must be an alias and can one blame him for using one if he appears in this stinker the story might been interesting but the acting is flat and direction is tedious if you must watch this film go around to your friend s house and get drunk while doing so then it ll be enjoyable
the title says it all tail gunner joe was a tag given to the senator which relied upon the ignorance of the public about world war ii aircraft the rear facing moving guns relied upon a latch that would prevent the rear gunner from shooting off the tail of the airplane by preventing the gun from firing when it pointed at the tail when the senator was practicing on the ground one day he succeeded in shooting off the tail of the airplane he couldn t have done that if the gun had been properly aligned the gunnery officer responsible for that admitted in public before a camera that he was responsible he had made the error not the senator the fact that the film did not report that fact shows how one sided it is this film was designed to do one thing destroy the reputation of a complex person a much better program was the pbs special done on him he was a hard working intelligent ambitious politician who overcame extraordinary disadvantages to rise to extraordinary heights he made some mistakes some serious mistakes but shooting the tail off an airplane was not one of them the popularity of this film is due to the fact that the public likes simple stories one sided stories so that they don t have to think
ming the merciless does a little bardwork and a movie most foul
original claymation rudolph pretty good original frosty cartoon needs a little work but could be worse but frosty and rudolph together on the fourth of july c mon give me a break this was one movie that shouldn t have been made it was bad it didn t really go for any holiday in particular except july that made it especially bad since frosty and rudolph are usually associated with the christmas season and any movie can be ruined by too much singing the frequent songs made this movie seem a lot longer than it really was the movie tried mixing two familiar chirstmastime characters with an american traditional holiday which almost seems to limit it to america too many pointless songs and a lousy plotline the result a bad movie that can t really be watched at any time of year i would suggest you forgo this movie even if you like frosty and rudolph
this is without a shadow of a doubt the absolute worst movie steven seagal has ever made and that says a lot don t get fooled by the rating it s way too good this abomination hadn t even been worthy of a rating if such a thing existed absolutely no plot worst action scenes ever and there aren t too many of them either seagal doesn t do anything himself including the fighting talking lots of dubbing and so on as always seagal is fat lazy and couldn t care less about this movie something which is very obvious all the way throughtake all the other garbage dtv movies seagal has made multiply them with each other multiply this with a thousand billions and all the badness you then get won t even describe of this absolute crapfest
my score for this crap for the technical only everything else is very bad another film that makes no sense clearly it seems that creating a good script for film or television is almost a impossible mission while it s easy to understand why politicians never say the truth they are among the biggest liars on the planet it is difficult to understand how to make films so pathetic we must believe that taking people for morons perhaps it was reason to believe since of the films are crap because they are stupid and ridiculous and very bad scenarios when you look at the price we give oscars we understand better why we continue to make films any more ridiculous than others and oddly enough it was always money for such nonsense but it was not for education and health if you still want to listen to this s t press super fast forward button at least x
two sisters their perverted brother and their cousin have car trouble they then happen about the home of dr hackenstein whom conveniently needs the body parts of three nubile young women to use in an experiment to bring his deceased lover back to life he tells them that he ll help them get home in the morning so they spend the night then the good doctor gets down to work in this low budget horror comedy i found this to be mildly amusing nothing at all to actually go out of your way for i stumbled across it on netflix instant view streamed it to the xbox but better then i expected it to be for a troma acquired film most of the humor doesn t work but their are still some parts that caused me to smile plus the late great anne ramsey has a small part and she was always a treat to watch eye candy bambi darro sylvia lee baker got topless my grade d
i tend to like character driven films i also think hope davis turns in consistently good work so i had high hopes for this movie those hopes were soon dashed the main flaw with this movie is the direction there are a lot of scenes that are daydream sequences the movie makes frequent use of the denis leary character as the alter ego of the campbell scott character it doesn t work for me at all this would have worked better as a play than a movie there are problems with the plot as well it is important that the characters in a movie take a journey and end up in a place different from where they started i didn t feel that the characters grew in the experiences portrayed in the movie finally the editing wasn t well done either there was a very big sag in the middle of the movie that was exceptionally boring except for acting which i felt was consistently strong this movie failed in almost every aspect of cinema
i never was an avid viewer of crocodile hunter but did occasionally see an episode or a bit of an episode and when the news spread about steve irwin s death from a stingray attack in it certainly caught my attention this movie with steve and his wife terri playing themselves but in a fictional story was released in but i didn t hear of it until several years later and even after that it took me a while to get around to seeing it well now i have seen it and after looking here first more than once and seeing its rating i was not surprised at how unimpressive it turned out to be though it could have been a bit better apparently it s supposed to be a comedy so a major problem with it is that it isn t very funny at all a u s satellite beacon falls down from space and lands in australia where it is swallowed by a crocodile while steve and terri irwin are on a mission to capture this crocodile from a place where it terrorizes the cattle on a ranch owned by the crazy brozzie drewitt and are unaware of what s inside it two cia agents are sent to australia to retrieve the beacon the agents are assisted by jo buckley and the ranch owner and her dogs might make the mission more difficult for them on steve and terri s mission they face other types of dangerous wildlife not just the crocodile and since they have no clue that the croc has anything unusual inside it when steve sees the cia agents after them he mistakes them for poachers not only did i not laugh once while watching this film the only part that really made me smile was steve irwin using a big snake to scare off one of the cia agents apart from that i don t think i found anything even mildly amusing it s also a bit of an incoherent mess switching back and forth from the australian outback to the cia headquarters and it seems like clips from crocodile hunter and clips from an action thriller or something like that put together for some reason also added to that mix are the ranch scenes which also seem to be from somewhere else and as funny as brozzie drewitt played by magda szubanski is supposed to be she s not at one point we see her farting so we have a fart joke a major clich in modern comedy are they so hard to resist i also found the typical crocodile hunter scenes with steve wrestling crocodiles and holding other dangerous creatures and talking about them to viewers to be tedious but i guess the fact that i was never a devout fan of the show didn t help steve irwin was admired by many as a conservationist and is sadly missed by them while there are also those who say he messed with nature and had it coming to him no matter which side you re on the crocodile hunter collision course is not a well crafted movie i m sure it does help if you re a big steve irwin fan but even if you are there s no guarantee that you would like this movie as some fans clearly haven t been impressed in fact it seems that some of them have found this movie to be worse than i have so maybe it won t help like i said there s no guarantee i would say whatever you may think of steve irwin and his show this movie was unnecessary the attempt to combine what is usually seen in crocodile hunter with a fictional story unfortunately failed and a viewer may find that this film seems longer than ninety minutes
without question one of the most embarrassing productions of the s gaots seems to really really want to be something important the tragic truth is that it s so entirely valueless on every level that one can t help but laugh reaching in desperation for the earthy elements of ingmar bergman s films it follows a city couple s day in the wilderness they walk along a shady path allthewhile pontificating like a u c berkeley coffee clatch almost every line of tarradiddle dialog delivered here is uproariously bad i feel that life itself is made up of as many tiny compartments as this pomegranate but is it as beautiful after what seems like an eternity of absolutely nothing happening well ok we are treated to some nudity and a tepid soft sex scene there is finally a very anticlimactic confrontation involving a pair nam vets who are making the nature scene and performing some pretty harsh folk ballads with an acoustic guitar nothing at all eventful or interesting happens in this entire film i thought the larry buchanan picture strawberries need rain was a weak example of a bergman homage golden apples is every bit as bad but the ceaseless random verbiage it presents makes it memorably awful
camille aspect ratio panavision sound format monowhilst visiting rome an amorous nobleman nino castelnuovo falls in love with a beautiful young libertine daniele gaubert but their unlikely romance is opposed by castelnuovo s wealthy father massimo serato and fate deals a tragic blow a sexed up love story for the swinging sixties adapted from a literary source alexandre dumas la dame aux camelias by screenwriter michael deforrest and directed with freewheeling flair by radley metzger who along with the likes of russ meyer and joe sarno is credited with redefining the parameters of adult cinema throughout the s and s using the scope format for the last time in his career metzger s exploration of la dolce vita is rich in visual excess note the emphasis on reflective surfaces for example though the film s sexual candor seems alarmingly coy by modern standards production values are handsome throughout and the performances are engaging and humane castelnuovo and gaubert are particularly memorable despite weak post sync dubbing though set in an unspecified future enrico sabbatini s wacked out set designs locate the movie firmly within its period and piero piccioni s wah wah music score has become something of a cult item amongst exploitation devotees ultimately camille is an acquired taste but fans of this director s elegant softcore erotica won t be disappointed next up for metzger was the lickerish quartet which many consider his best film
man even plan from outer space is better than this movie this flick doesn t have enough plot for half an hour yet they managed to extend it for an eternity of more than an hour jet li and corey yuen are pretty good specially in those exaggerated fight scenes but stuff like the legend of fong sai yuk is much better than this sorry thing that would be better left unmade
i saw the film and i got screwed because the film was foolish and boring i thought ram gopal varma will justify his work but unfortunately he failed and the whole film got spoiled and they spoiled sholay the cast and crew was bad the whole theater slept while watching the movie some people ran away in the middle amithab bachan s acting is poor i thought this movie will be greatest hit of the year but this film will be the greatest flop of the year sure nobody did justice to their work including ajay devagan this film don t deserve any audiences i bet that this film will flop finally this movie sucks
this movie really deserves the mst k treatment a pseudo ancient fantasy hack n slash tale featuring twin barbarian brothers with a collective iq of hot water character names that seem to have been derived from a mad libs book and such classic lines as hold her down and uncover her belly the barbarians crosses over into the so bad it s good territory
lillian hellman s play adapted by dashiell hammett with help from hellman becomes a curious project to come out of gritty warner bros paul lukas reprising his broadway role and winning the best actor oscar plays an anti nazi german underground leader fighting the fascists dragging his american wife and three children all over europe before finding refuge in the states via the mexico border they settle in washington with the wife s wealthy mother and brother though a boarder residing in the manor is immediately suspicious of the newcomers and spends an awful lot of time down at the german embassy playing poker it seems to take forever for this drama to find its focus and when we realize what the heart of the material is the wise honest direct refugees teaching the clueless head in the sand americans how the world has suddenly changed it seems a little patronizing the viewer is quite literally put in the relatives place being lectured to lukas has several speeches in the third act which undoubtedly won him the academy award yet for the much of the picture he seems to do little but enter and exit enter and exit as his spouse bette davis enunciates like nobody else and works her wide eyes to good advantage but the role doesn t allow her much color their children all with divergent accents are alternately humorous and annoying and geraldine fitzgerald has a nothing role as a put upon wife and the disgruntled texture she brings to the part seems entirely wrong the intent here was to tastefully tactfully show us just because a wwii era man may be german that doesn t make him a nazi sympathizer we get that in the first few minutes the rest of this tasteful tactful movie is made up of exposition defensive confrontation and ultimately compassion it should be a heady mix but instead it s rather dry eyed and inert from
how has this piece of crap stayed on tv this long it s terrible it makes me want to shoot someone it s so fake that it is actually worse than a s sci fi movie i d rather have a stroke than watch this nonsense i remember watching it when it first came out i thought hey this could be interesting then i found out how absolutely insanely ridiculously stupid it really was it was so bad that i actually took out my pocket knife and stuck my hand to the table please people stop watching this and all other reality shows they re the trash that is jamming the networks and canceling quality programming that requires some thought to create
i caught this cuban film at at an arthouse film club it was shown shortly after the magisterial silly symphony cartoon where the isle of symphony is reconciled with the isle of jazz what with the recently deceased ruben gonzalez piped through speakers in this old cinema ballroom and a cuban flag hanging from peeling stucco rocaille motifs the scene was set for a riproaring celebration of engaged filmmaking and synchronised hissing at the idiocies of helms burton but then the film started and the cinema s peeling paint gradually became more interesting than the shoddy mess on screen the storyline of nada mas promises much carla is a bored envelope stamper at a cuban post office her only escape from an altogether humdrum existence is to purloin letters and rewrite them transforming basic interpersonal grunts into bront an outbursts of breathless emotion cue numerous shots of photogenic cubans gushing with joy grief pity terror and the like the problem is that the simplicity of the narrative is marred by endless excursions into film school artiness latino caricature marx brothers slapstick and even during a particularly underwhelming editing trick the celluloid scratching of a schoolkid defacement onto a character s face unidimensional characters abound cunda the boss at the post office is a humourless dominatrix nosferatu her boss eyed accomplice concha variously points fingers eavesdrops and screeches cesar the metalhead dolt and romantic interest reveals hidden writing talent when carla departs for miami a chase scene in oh so hilarious fast forward is thrown in for good measure all this would be fine in a mortadello and filemon comic strip but in a black and white zero fx flick with highbrow pretensions ahem nada mas attempts to straddle the stile somewhere between the quirky heroine matchmakes strangers of amelie and the poetry as great redeemer theme of il postino like amelie its protagonist is an eccentric single white female who combats impending spinsterdom by trying to bring magic into the lives of strangers and like il postino the film does not flinch from sustained recitals of poetry and a postman on a bicycle takes a romantic lead unfortunately nada mas fails to capture the lushness and transcendence of either film there are two things that might merit watching this film in a late night tv stupor the first is the opening overhead shot of carla on a checker tiled floor which cuts to the crossword puzzle she is working on the second is to see nada mas as a cautionary example our post buena vista social club obsession with cuban artistic output can often blinker us into accepting any dross that features a bongo on the soundtrack this film should not have merited a global release films such as waiting list and guantanamera cover similar thematic territory far more successfully
unhinged was part of the video nasty censorship film selection that the uk built up in the s keeps the gory stuff out of the hands of children don t you know it must have left many wondering what the fuss was all about by today s standard unhinged is a tame little fairy tale girls are off to a jazz concert and right away you know the body count is going to be quite low they get lost in the woods wind up getting in a car accident that looks so fake it s laughable they are picked up by some nearby residents that live in the woods in a creepy house one of the girls is seriously injured and has to stay upstairs then there s talking talking about why the girls are here and how they must be to dinner on time because mother doesn t like it when someone is late and more talking yakkity yak some suspense is built as a crazy guy is walking around and harassing the girls and someone s eyeball is looking through holes in the walls at the pretty girls in something that looks like hitchcock s psycho i digress because there is so much blah blah in this film that you wonder when the killings are going to start in fact one of the girls gets so bored out of her mind that she walks in the woods alone looking for the town smart move she probably knew about the lonely virgin walking alone in the woods part but just didn t care more talk continues after this as we wait wait and wait some more until the next girl may or may not be killed and then there s the twist ending the expected unexpected for some viewers for others a real gotcha quite possibly the only reason why someone would really want to watch this i don t care how twisted it is nothing in this movie makes up for the most boring time i had watching it even with the minor impact of the ending the director just didn t have what it takes to really deliver a good story with it it would have made a much better minute hour tv episode on say tales from the darkside if you really must get this for any reason perhaps just to say you ve watched every slasher movie do yourself a favor and have the fast forward button ready since the movie has so many unimportant scenes just zoom through them and in no time you ll get to the wow that s what it was all this time ending oh and halfway through the movie there s a shower scene with girls showing boo bees horray for boo bees those beautiful buzzing honey making boo bees
this is listed as a documentary it s not it s filmed sort of like a documentary but that i suspect was just because then they get away with a shaky camera and dodgy filming this has just been released in the uk on dvd as an american pie style comedy it s not that either basically it follows around a group of teens on spring break as they go to mexico for cheap booze and with the quest being to get there virgin friend finally laid throw is a couple of dwarfs also on the same sort of quest and you have a non hilarious tale of drunk teens trying to get some girls considering the rating this has very little nudity and practically zero sex scenes mainly i guess the rating is for swearing of which there is plenty if you like crude jackass behaviour without the humour then this may be your thing if you have any brain cells left then i would probably avoid this
i don t even know where to begin on this one it s all about the family that has to be the worst line of dialogue ever heard in a horror movie although this couldn t be a horror movie even if it tried ugh and i know that owen wilson is a better actor he needs to stop playing the token guy who dies in every action movie anaconda armageddon after all the man did co write bottle rocket and rushmore he does have some talent also lily taylor should stick to indie films she has no place here finally catherine zeta jones should become a porn star there s no room in legitimate acting for her i m serious one of the worst movies i ve ever seen ever
this movie was exactly what i expected it to be when i first read the casting i probably could have written a more exciting plot it s a pity that they left it to a pack of howler monkeys alberto tomba was surely a good skier but he has to thank god and we too that he does not have to rely on his actor skills to earn his living he can t play he can t talk he can t even move very good on mainland without his skis michelle hunziker is a pretty blonde girl and that s all she obviously wasn t chosen for her astounding competence in dramatic roles but most probably for her nice legs nevertheless i must admit that she could be the tomba s acting teacher because he s even a worse actor than her and that s funny especially considering that she isn t italian i laughed all the time watching this movie i found it so ridiculous and meaningless that it actually made me laugh loud very loud
lynn hollister a small town lawyer travels to the nearby big city on business connected with the death of his friend johnny yes lynn is a man despite the feminine sounding christian name were the scriptwriters trying to make a snide reference to the fact that john wayne s birth name was marion hollister at first believes johnny s death to have been an accident but soon realises that johnny was murdered further investigations reveal a web of corruption criminality and election rigging connected to boss cameron the leading light in city s political machine that sounds like the plot of a gritty crime thriller possibly made in the film noir style which was starting to become popular in it isn t a man betrayed despite its theme is more like a light romantic comedy than a crime drama hollister falls in love with cameron s attractive daughter sabra and the film then concentrates as much on their resulting romance as on the suspense elements this film might just have worked if it had been made as a straightforward serious drama one reviewer states that john wayne is not at all believable as a lawyer but he couldn t play a cowboy in every movie and a tough crusading lawyer taking on the forces of organised crime would probably have been well within his compass where i do agree with that reviewer is when he says that wayne was no cary grant impersonator romantic comedy just wasn t up his street one of the weaknesses of the studio system is that actors could be required to play any part their bosses demanded of them regardless of whether it was up their street or not and as wayne was one of the few major stars working for republic pictures they doubtless wanted to get as much mileage out of him as they could that said not even cary grant himself could have made a man betrayed work as a comedy that s not a reflection on his comic talents it s a reflection on the total lack of amusing material in this film i doubt if anyone no matter how well developed their sense of humour might be could find anything to laugh at in it the film s light hearted tone doesn t make it a successful comedy it just prevents it from being taken seriously as anything else this is one of those films that are neither fish nor flesh nor fowl nor good red herring
this movie was amazingly bad i don t think i ve ever seen a movie where every attempt at humor failed as miserably let s see the acting was pathetic the special effects where horrible the plot non existant that pretty much sums up this movie
portly nice guy falls for a luscious blonde she likes him too but not for the reasons you might think little seen black comedy from writer pat proft features very good performances by joe alaskey and donna dixon yet it makes no lasting impact it s just a quickie throwaway effort helmed by norman bates himself anthony perkins even on the level of b comedies the somewhat similar eating raoul is a better bet there s definitely an amusing set up here unfortunately the picture has nowhere to go in its second act an interesting try but it misfires from
there are some stallone movies i like but this movie didn t meet my low expectations i found this movie hard to believe for example a bunch of terrorists who crash land in the wilderness are prepared to survive for at least two days also in all this wilderness stallone and company keep running across bridges and ladders that provide convenient short cuts or plot devices also the treasury cops don t seem to coordinate anything with the local rescue people also bad guys who couldn t hit the side of a barn with really high tech looking automatic weapons i liked john lithgow s villain initially but the character is such a complete psychopath that he doesn t care at all about any of his own bad guys or all of them getting killed eventually i just couldn t believe the character anymore not worth the price of a rental not even worth taking the time to watch
i only watched this because it was directed by lucio fulci and featured claudio cassinelli an actor i like i was certainly disappointed the idea that condemned prisoners would fight to the death for tv ratings has been overdone with rollerball logan s run blade runner and the new film death race which will certainly suck me in because it stars jason statham this was just a bore for the most part the kill bike action was ridiculous the training was a snooze fest it just never grabbed me and made me want to care about anyone including dallas star jared martin or fred williamson pick one of the others mentioned and you ll be better off
in a time when the constitution and principals the united states were founded on are trampled underfoot by an administration desperate to distract attention from its own internal problems where the geneva convention human rights and foreign sovereignty are unapologetically discarded a thriller about the state taking illegal action that far exceeds that of the terrorists they are countering might seem appropriate however if you want to see a film about that try ed zwick s flawed the siege instead because nada is one of the most infantile political thrillers ever made like robert altman s pret a porter the director has taken on a subject he seems completely ignorant of and imprints his ignorance on almost every frame his terrorists are a wildly unconvincing group of stereotypes fabio testi dresses as if he were auditioning for mad magazine s spy vs spy strip michel duchaussoy behaves like an absurd kids in the hall send up of the sociology professor from hell mariangela melato a cardboard middle class revolutionary wannabe who behave at every unconvincing plot turn as if they want to be caught the corrupt authorities fare a little better but are still painted in unconvincingly broad strokes it is possible to make a smart film about dumb people cf election but this is a moronic film about dumb people made by people who think they re intellectuals who are talking down to the masses in truth were one to recast testi duchaussoy and melato with jim varney johnny knoxville and shannon tweed the result would actually be to raise the intellectual content of the film not lower it chabrol might just have got away with his characters and events if he took them seriously but his staging is so inept the fight scenes would embarrass a kindergarten class while the shooting of the kidnapping is more inept than the kidnapping itself and his inability to get his cast to perform with at least some approximation of recognisable human behaviour so blatant that it is actually embarrassing to watch special mention must be made here of duchaussoy so very good in chabrol s que la bete muere he is stunningly bad here in a performance that is so far over the top it s back again chabrol has made some fine films but you would never guess it from this amateurish mess a newcomer to his work would never want to see another of his films after this which would be a great shame utter drivel and a sad waste of a potentially interesting material one star out of ten and that s being very generous
did heidijean really see this movie a great christmas movie not even close dull bland and completely lacking in imagination and heart i kept watching this movie wondering who the hell thought that carly pope could play the lead in this movie the woman has no detectable personality and gives a completely lackluster performance baransky was great as usual and provided the only modicum of interesting the whole thing probably her involvement was the only reason this project was green lighted to begin with maybe i m expecting too much for a lifetime movie played days from christmas but i sat through this thing thinking that with a different director and a recasting jj with an actress that at least could elicit sympathy this could have been quite a cute little movie
the problems with this film are many but i will try to mention the most glaring and bothersome ones first of all while the theme suggests a number of vignettes about manhattan life the reality was that everything as usual in movies and tv was about something bizarre usually of a sexual nature the story lines were thin or nonexistent and virtually every scene camera shot line of dialog and expressed emotion was absolutely and totally fake it finally reached a point after an hour of so of mind numbing garbage that i walked out something no uncommon for me in recent years i would have guessed the fi lm was directed by some wannabe auteur drop outs from some rd rate film studies program but i believe the at one time pre amelia talented director mira nair took part in this disgusting travesty so perhaps the directorial talent in america has descended en masse into the cesspool
it s my opinion that when you decide to re make a very good film you should strive to do better than the original or at least give it a fresh point of view now the robert wise telling of shirley jackson s remarkable novel the haunting of hill house is worth the price of admission even today now fast forward to and the re make i was left shaking my head and asking why the acting is wooden the story unrecognizable and the whole point seems to be to replace the subtle horror of the original with as many special effects computers can generate i had heard that this update was bad but couldn t believe it was that bad considering the source material i was wrong after watching this and saying to my wife how awful it was she said well they got your money she s right don t let them get yours if there s no profit in making lousy re makes maybe they ll stop making them or come up to a higher standard that doesn t insult their audience
the first time i watched cold case was after it had run for about a year on danish television at the time it came to the tv it nearly drowned in or other american crime shows aired roughly the same time i saw it and i was bored to death the substandard actors with the self righteous faces and morals were a pain in the behind the entire premise that so much money was given a team of investigators to solve murders dating back or even years seems so unlikely the time is also a factor as they only have min to tell the story which means that they get a break through just in the nick of time to solve the case and bring justice to surviving family members if they are still alive this combined with the personal problems and relations of the investigators which there has to be time for leaves the show a complete lackluster i give it a star rating because of the music i the end which is really the only reason for watching it which you then of course won t do as that is too lame a reason for watching this crap
studio aka the possessed in the uk is another sub par slasher that has the appearance of a straight to dvd movie whilst many of the straight to dvd movies are fast paced or unintentionally hilarious in the so bad it s good sense studio is a lamentable failure at the time of writing every comment on the first page includes a negative rating and a negative review every one of these people have hit the nail on the head the two people at the time of writing who wrote comments with a rating of out of should not be taken seriously obviously they ve seen few slasher movies and have an even more limited understanding of horror the only really positive point i can make about this movie is that it does fare better than the choke and one of them two extremely mediocre slasher movies that i would not wish on my worst enemy the plot of this movie must have been done hundreds if not thousands of times the movie only has a slight twist and one that is badly handled to the usual expectations a depressed singer commits suicide soon after her spirit returns to possess one of her surviving friends the said possessed friend goes on a killing spree the rest of the plot really is too bizarre to sum up you ll just have to see it for yourself providing your interest has not yet waned to the point of extinction of course the acting in the movie is very poor for the most part the actress who played dora was an exception to this her character was always interesting and seductive when she was on the screen she helps to elevate the movie above similar contemporary efforts unfortunately some of the lines she was given to say were badly written to put it mildly and thus prevent her from saving the movie the direction was equally poor the villains did not seem the least bit menacing every killing was totally devoid of suspense or tension atmosphere was non existent and the camera work was incredibly basic some of the special effects if you can call them that reminded me of the tv series ghost stories unfortunately for the producers of this movie ghost stories had intelligently written scripts believable performances and made superb use of camera angles maybe if the producers had watched that tv series closely they d have picked up some more techniques that might have saved this excuse for a movie the music is completely unsuited to the tone of the movie it s just rock music and not the best examples of this type either don t get me started on that awful song played at the beginning some aspects of the movie particularly dialogue are unintentionally funny unfortunately they are not funny enough to move the movie up or should it be down to the so bad it s good level overall studio is a mundane mediocre slasher with very little noteworthy aspects i recommend this only to those who are fans of straight to dvd movies and have a desire to see every single slasher ever made
truly one of the most dire films i ve ever sat through i ve never actually taken the time to write one of these but felt compelled to after witnessing this affront to film making and feel somewhat aggrieved to be wasting my time on such a piece of turd to be honest there were so many parts that infuriated me with their complete randomness and lack of sense e g when would the police force ever shoot people with infectious diseases when would hospitals ever through out such people for lack of a cure why was the guy who spotted him spying on his wife wandering around outside in his dressing gown whilst carrying a gun as she rolled around on the bed also the characterisation as we ve almost come to expect in such films was awful e g the way the blonde guy i don t remember his frickin name and don t give a toss anyway completely turned against his girlfriend and ran off to leave her and i ended up wanting them all to meet grisly ends the production was horribly disjointed and the cinematography nothing to write home about
this is the kind of film that everyone involved with should be embarrassed over poor directing over the top acting and a plot that rambles on with no point other than to show violence i thought when i first saw it that it would be perhaps a satire of the media and how it shows violence but it s not i m not sure what makes the film worse oliver stone does his worst directing ever from scenes where woody harrelson s face morphs for no reason or robert downey jr s dreadful performance as wayne gale who is a reporter who seems totally bonkers this movie is simply a mess
iberia is nice to see on tv but why see this in silver screen lot of dance and music if you like classical music or modern dance this could be your date movie but otherwise one and half hour is just too long time if you like to see skillful dancing in silver screen it s better to see bollywood movie they know how to combine breath taking dancing to long movie director carlos saura knows how to shoot dancing from old experience and time to time it s look really good but when the movie is one and hour it should be at least most of time interesting there are many kind of art not everything is bigger then life and this film is not too big
this movie is about as underrated as police acadmey mission to moscow this movie is never funny it s maybe the worst comedy spoof ever made very boring and dumb beyond belief for those people that think this movie is underrated god help you i give this movie out of
when i first saw this film i thought it should have come from the children s section it s very fun and at times humorous and is actually quite a good story but it severely lacks the romantic chemistry that actors like meg ryan and tim robbins are capable of delivering i must note that walter matthau is perfect for the part of albert einstein and his performance is extraordinary but that s the sole exception this film appears a bit forced the directing lacks substance and oh yeah the music is ridiculously awful it didn t put me in a very good mood but if you are not expecting a smart well crafted comedy romance tale then this certainly can be entertaining like i said it should be in the children s section einstein and his buddies are a good relief from tim robbins boring almost tense quest to steal meg ryan s heart a very conflicting film but as long as it s not taken seriously this can be an alright movie
according to reviewers the year is and the players are year old college kids about to enter grad school jolly joke the synthesizer keyboard was not invented yet but there it is on the bandstand the ford pony car was not invented yet but there it is playing oldies music the synthesizer appeared to be a model from the mid s the pony car at best is from the mid s year old college kids josh brolin had seen birthdays when this made for tv movie was produced the plot is so predictable that viewers have plenty of spare time to think of all the errors appearing upon their tv s
the director states in the behind the scenes feature that he loves horror movies he loves them so much that he dedicated the movie to dario argento as well as other notable directors such as george a romero and tobe hooper basically dedicating this movie to those great directors is like giving your mother a piece of sh t for mother s day the first thing they did wrong was the casting cast people that can act also don t cast a person that is years old for the role of a misunderstood year old recluse that s right he s been in high school for years the reactions made by people as they watch their boyfriends get their hearts ripped out is amusing or like one part when a guy gets stabbed in the ear with an ear of corn haha get it and his girlfriend just goes oh my god the scarecrow himself is quite a character doing flips off cars and calling people losers the movie does have one redeeming factor oh wait no it doesn t if you absolutely must see this movie than just watch the rock and roll trailer on the dvd it covers about everything and has a really gnarly song dude
it is a good film for kids who love dogs it runs a bit slow early on but ends if a flurry of gooped up de vil the basic plot is the same as the first movie the bright side of the movie for adults is the talking bird that thinks it is a dog the bird talks like a human eric idle of monty python and barks like a dog it is the comedy that the film needed more of see it in the matinee so you don t have to pay full price or wait for it to appear on disney
exceptionally horrible tale that i can barely put into words the best part of the movie was when one of the murder victims turns up at the end alive and well only to be massacred again there is the chance that i missed some crucial plot elements since i may have been in a slight coma during the time this baby was on the box that the movie comes in shows scenes that are never even in the film i was lured in by the crude images of bondage torture and promises of a euro trash sexy horror flick i get the feeling this was the budget version and about one quarter of the film was left out all the good stuff more than likely i got the pg addition that made about as much sense as the end to the new planet of the apes movie watch this one with a friend and a bottle of the hard stuff you ll need it
this film features ben chaplin as a bored bank employee in england who orders a mail order bride from russia recieves nicole kidman in the mail and gets more than he bargained for when surprise she isn t what she appears to be the story is fairly predictible and chaplin underacts too much to the point where he becomes somewhat anoying kidman is actualy rather good in this role making her character about the only thing in this film that is interesting grade c
everybody who wants to be an editor should watch this movie it shows you about every mistake not to do in editing a movie my grandma could have done better than that but that s not the only reason why this movie is really bad it s actually so bad that i m not able to write a sentence without exclamation mark if the first episode of les visiteurs was a quite good familial comedy with funny jokes and cult dialogues this sequel is copying badly the receipe of the first one the funny parts could be counted on one hand and maybe half of it clavier is over acting his role even more than in the first part robin is trying to act like lemercier because she s replacing her but that s grotesque lemercier is lemercier robin is robin even if muriel robin can be funny by herself on stage she is not in this movie because she s not acting as she used to act i know that it should be hard to replace somebody who was good in a role lemercier obtained a c sar award for her role in the first movie but she made a big mistake instead of playing her role she played lemercier playing her role as for the story it s just too much of course we knew at he end of the first movie that there would be a sequel but poir and clavier should hae tried to write a more simple story like the first episode the gags are repetitive childish and d j vu no really there s no more than funny parts in this the only good things might be the costumes and some special effects so you have only reasons to watch it if you want to learn how to edit awfully a movie if you want to waste your time or if you really need a brainless moment
this movie really has no beginning or end and it s really very unbelievable mary k and ashley are supposed to be interns working in a mailing room for an italian fashion company but for some reason they re put up in a star hotel conveniently located across the street from the coliseum and all of the other interns they work with are just as abnormally model looking as they are one thing that i found obvious in this movie is the way that one of the twins doesn t end up with the guy i guess they tried to twist their usual plot a bit nice try
this and immoral tales both left a bad taste in my mouth it seems to me that borowczyk is disgusted by sex and these two films are cautionary tales about what will happen if you do have sex as a film it s not very well done some of the acting is truly epically bad such as the american woman with the french accent the young woman s sudden flip flop from being anxious about the marriage to being interested when it seems like it should have been the other way around and the aunt s sudden realization of the young man s secret don t make sense they re not explained at all i also didn t like how the daughter s relationship with a black man was presented as a sign of her family s perversion or predilection for bestiality the central idea the idea that there s this sexy beast if you will that lives in the woods could have been a foundation for a perverse but fun story but instead is just used as a basis for a nasty sex negative morality play
when i heard the plot for this movie i simply had to see it i mean whole cities being wiped out by killer tomatoes sadly the title is about as funny as it gets led by detective dick mason a special team of military and scientists including greg colburn who never takes his scuba outfit off and lt finletter who is never pictured without his parachute trailing behind attack of the killer tomatoes is a parody of b movies in particular japanese horror of the s the film begins with a standard sized tomato being discovered by a women washing up in her kitchen before we find ourselves in a middle of a crime scene as the tomato has supposedly murdered this lady and let me tell you it doesn t get any saner as the film progresses to be fair there are a couple of funny moments for instance anytime the japanese scientist dr nokitofa speaks his voice is dubbed over in an american accent or when disguise expert sam smith infiltrates the tomatoes hey can somebody please pass the ketchup equally this film was probably a lot funnier in with the whole so bad its good concept unfortunately for attack of the killer tomatoes spoof films such as the airplane and naked gun series have been released and done this kind of comedy a lot better since the acting is atrocious there is zero continuity in the editing and it just feels genuinely slow and lacking energy for a parody film to work you need a lot of things happening at once one gag after the over the singing in the film seems pointless and the adverts for the furniture store that flash across the screen are damn right bizarre even for this film ultimately however you can see why this film is a cult one i can t see many people being indifferent to it unfortunately terrible would be the way i would sum this up
a blair witch war movie that is as much of a letdown as bwitch was the title says it all save your money and your time and spend it on a good movie such as once upon a time in america the shawshank redemption or enemy at the gates if you want to watch a great war movie etc this movie if it were a baseball team and the major leagues were the pinnacle and single a was the rookies then this movie was high school ball it was filmed as if it were a high school drama club filming with their daddy s old camera sure they went into a hostile area to make a film but i don t call that brave around here we call that plain stupid this is a pass all the way now go watch it and then you tell me what you think
the king maker will doubtless be a success in thailand where the similar but superior the legend of suriyothai set box office records the film directed by lek kitaparaporn after a screenplay by sean casey based on historical fact in siam has some amazingly beautiful visual elements but is disarmed by one of the corniest pedestrian scripts and story development on film the event the picture relates is the arrival of the portuguese soldier of fortune fernando de gamma gary stretch whose vengeance for this father s murderer drives him to shipwrecked captured and thrown into slavery and put on the bloc in ayutthaya in the kingdom of siam where he is purchased by the beautiful maria cindy burbridge with the consent of her father phillipe john rhys davies a man with a name and a past that are revealed as the story progresses there is a plot to overthrown the king and fernando and his new siamese sidekick tong dom hetrakul after some gratuitous cgi enhanced choreographed martial arts silliness are first rewarded by the king to become his bodyguards only to be imprisoned together once queen sudachan yoe hassadeevichit reveals her plot to kill the king and son to allow her lover lord chakkraphat oliver pupart to take over the rule of siam yet of course fernando and tong escape and are condemned to fight each other to save the lives of their families tong s wife and children and fernando s now firm love affair with maria with the expected consequences the acting with the exception of john rhys davies is so weak that the film occasionally seems as though it were meant to be camp the predominantly thai cast struggle with the poorly written dialog making us wish they had used their native thai with subtitles the musical score by ian livingstone sounds as though exhumed form old tv soap operas but if it is visual splendor you re after there is plenty of that and that alone makes the movie worth watching it is a film that has obvious high financial backing for all the special effects and masses of cast and sets and shows its good intentions it is just the basics that are missing grady harp
i ll keep this short as a movie like this doesn t deserve a full review given the setting this movie could have been something really special it could have been another days later or even a blair witch project the first or so minutes of the movie i was really excited directer did a decent job with cinematography and suspense although i don t think he managed to capture true eeriness of an empty london underground characters were a big let down our heroine in this movie is a worthless piece of crap and you really don t care if she dies or not as many people have said before i was rooting for the homeless people and the black guy who managed to give me a chuckle or two whether intentional of the writers or not the main villain is kept in the dark for the first half of the movie but when he is revealed i was really disappointed i won t spoil it but lets just say my year old sister could probably beat him in a wrestling match all in all this is just another mediocre horror film which falls into the trap of following a simple hollywood formula this film had a lot of potential but really failed to hit the mark just to highlight how lame this movie was the characters in this movie had at least five times to finish off and kill the main villain instead they run away
not the best of the films to be watched nowadays i read a lot of reviews about shining and was expecting it to be very good but this movie disappointed me the sound and environment was good but there was no story here not was there a single moment of fright i expected it to a horror thriller movie but there was no horror no thriller the only scene where i got scared was during the chapter change scene showing wednesday there are lots of fragments i the movie most of the things are left unexplained with nothing to link it to anything the story does not tell us about the women or other scenes that is shown might be a good movie to watch in the s but not for the st century
this movie is just plain terrible slow acting slow at getting to the point and wooden characters that just shouldn t have been on there the best part was the showing of iron maiden singing in some video at a theater and thats it the ending was worth watching and waiting up for but that was it the characters in this movie put me to sleep almost avoid it
a vietnam vet decides to take over a backwater town run amok and anyone who steps in his path is eliminated including women released to theaters just prior to a star is born which turned his career around this action drama mishmash starring kris kristofferson is wildly off kilter thoughtless and mean spirited filmed in simi valley ca the results are truly unseemly with redneck clich s and mindless violence making up most of director george armitage s script armitage has gathered a most curious s cast for his film including jan michael vincent victoria principal bernadette peters and in a bit loni anderson however the center of the whole thing is kristofferson who is gruff and rude throughout it deserves points i suppose for being a completely unsympathetic drive in thriller but the bad vibes and the ridiculous climax coat the whole project like an ugly stain from
acting is horrible this film makes fast and furious look like an academy award winning film they throw a few boobs and butts in there to try and keep you interested despite the extremely weak and far fetched story there is a reason why people on the internet aren t even downloading this movie this movie sunk like an iron turd do not waste your time renting or even downloading it this film is and always will be a perma turd i am now dumber for having watched it in fact this title should be referred to as a perma turd from now on calling it a film is a travesty and insult abhorrent abominable appalling awful beastly cruel detestable disagreeable disgusting dreadful eerie execrable fairy fearful frightful ghastly grim grisly gruesome heinous hideous horrendous horrid loathsome lousy lurid mean nasty obnoxious offensive repellent repulsive revolting scandalous scary shameful shocking sickie terrible terrifying ungodly unholy unkind
typical formula action film a good cop gets entangled in a mess of crooked cops and japanese gangsters the okay result has decent performances a few fleeting snicker inducing moments and some fair action sequences plus a chance to check out the gorgeous danielle harris who makes the most of her perpetual typecasting as a rebellious teen daughter out of
i didn t have huge expectations for this film when renting it for at the video store but the box at least showed a little promise with its killer cut of more gore more sex can t go wrong there well needless to say the box is a fraud how in the hades did actors and actresses of this caliber sign on for a film this low it all opens with a drunken college girl walking out of a frat house or some other building like that and saying some useless crap to her boyfriend as a camera on a bad steadicam follows her then she gets chased by some dude in a clear plastic mask and grabbed by another they slit her wrists for no real reason and you can see when they cut her that someone drew the cuts with what looks like a crayon from there repeat the same theme of the girl getting chased killed unbrutally by two guys for about more minutes add in one tit shot that is soul survivors i wouldn t have had a problem with this film had the box not frauded me into renting the flick if i rent a bad film that claims to have more violence and sex i want more violence and sex one full frontal shot in minutes from a chick who is clearly androginous and gore that would not scare a child does not cut it if this is the killer cut what is the theatrical cut of course i doubt this garbage was actually put into theaters in the first place shame on the actors in this film i could see them making their screen debuts in here because they have not done anything before but they were all established before this was released i don t know if it was filmed before they had all been established and the studio sat on the film until they were semi big names or not but what i want to know is they really spent million on this film
natural born killers cinema cut r director s cut nc it s an unusual oliver stone picture but when i read he was on drugs during the filming i needed no further explanation natural born killers is a risky mad all out film making that we do not get very often strange psychotic artistic pictures natural born killers is basically the story of how two mass killers were popularised and glorified by the media there is a great scene where an interviewer questions some teenagers about mickey and mallory and the teenager says murder is wrong but if i was a mass murderer i d be mickey and mallory mickey describes this with a situation of frankenstein the monster and dr frankenstein dr frankenstein is the media who has turned them into these monstrous killersmost oliver stone films examine the flaws of the america the country that the director loves and admires i guess natural born killers is about the effect of mass media technology and how obsessive as a nation americans are and most of the world over things such as mass killers and bizarre situations the killers played by woody harrelson mickey and juliette lewis mallory are executed astonishingly by two excellent actors who step into the lives of two interestingly brutal killers mickey and mallory believe that some people are worthy of killing perhaps in the cruel theory of social darwinism survival of the fittest mickey says in his interview in prison that other species commit murder we as humans ravage other species and exploit the environment the script is interesting but it is questionable how much this film amounts to in the sense of making us think about society and human behaviour rather than the intensity of a hour bloodbath that we have seen the last hour of the film takes place in a maximum security prison we see the harsh realities of prison life the attitudes of the warden etc overfilling of prisons maybe stone is questioning the future the path that society is leading to two other interesting characters first a reporter who runs a show about america s maniacs and is obsessed with boosting ratings that he goes to any length to capture the story of mickey and mallory the other is police officer scagnetti an insane perhaps sadistic officer that is in love with mallory he also has some weird obsession with mass killers since his mother was killed during the massacre at waco texas by charles whitman the cinematography is superb different colours shadows styles create a feeling of disorientation the green colour most evident of all is green to resemble the sickness of the killers in the drugstore when they are looking for rattlesnake antidote the camera work is insane shaky buzzy it takes some determination to get use to it and accept it highly unorthodox psychedelic and unusual natural born killers does not glamourise the existence of insane murderers it questions it and how we as the public may fuel this attribute although the above review sound quite positive i did dislike the film quentin tarantino who originally wrote the script for the film was not pleased with the altered screenplay and he asked for his name to be removed i can see why while mildly interesting at times natural born killers is a mess of a picture
this is an amateur movie shot on video not an electrifying drama as the dvd liner notes falsely boast i have seen much better stuff from undergrad film students the bulk of the story unfolds with an all nite taxi ride around jakarta this movie could have been made using a single video camera but there are a few sections where two cameras were used and the content was bounced together later the editing is extremely rough the final edit was probably done with two cameras bouncing content back and forth instead of with a proper editor perhaps they did the editing in the taxi too the english subtitles were written by someone not fluent in english e g where you go now to say the production quality is on a par with blair witch is generous if you re not scared away yet this film was an ambitious and creative endeavor with lots of cool and funky images from all over jakarta
i was unlucky enough to have seen this at the sidewalk film festival sidewalk as a whole was a disappointment and this movie was the final nail in the coffin being a devout fan of lewis carroll s alice books i was very excited about this movie s premier which only made it that much more uncomfortable to watch normally i m enthusiastic about modern re tellings if they are treated well usually it s interesting to see the parallels between the past and present within a familiar story unfortunately this movie was less of a modern retelling and more of a pop culture perversion the adaptation of the original s characters seemed juvenile and usually proved to be horribly annoying it probably didn t help that the actors weren t very good either most performances were ridiculously over the top which i assume was either due to bad direction or an effort to make up for a bad script i did not laugh once through out the duration of the film all of the jokes were outdated references to not so current events that are sure to lose their poignancy as time goes by really the only highlight of the film was the opening sequence in which the white rabbit is on his way to meet alice but even then the score was a poor imitation of danny elfman s work also i d have to say that the conversion of the croquet game into a rave dance off was awful it was with out a doubt the low point of the film what a joke don t see this movie after its conclusion i was genuinely angry
munchies starts in deepest darkest peru looks more like a dirt road to me where archaeologist simon watterman harvey korman his son paul charles stratton are on an expedition simon thinks that ancient aztec buildings were in fact spacecraft control centres he is on a mission to gain proof that alien lifeforms have visited earth while in once such structure he discovers a strange small creature which he sticks in his backpack takes back home with him to the small american town of sweetwater in california simon feels that the creature is the proof he has been looking for for some inexplicable reason decides to leave the thing at home while he goes to share his discovery simon ask s paul his wife cindy nadine van der velde to take care of it meanwhile simon s brother fast food businessman cecil watterman harvey korman again steals the creature so his brother won t make any money out of it but his idiotic stepson dude jon stafford has a fight with it chops it up with a knife but the individual parts grow back into separate little creatures that proceed to cause much havoc amongst the townspeople directed by bettina hirsch this has to be one of the worst horror comedy s ever if not the worst the script by lance smith is so unfunny it s painful every joke in munchies misses the target by the proverbial mile i doubt the humour in this piece of crap would even appeal to pre teens there just isn t anything even remotely funny or even amusing in munchies as far as i m concerned the basic story is crap too they just happen to find this creature running around with no explanation of what it is why no ones ever seen it before how it manages to learn english so quickly how it learns to drive etc the whole thing is a big gremlins rip off with none of the elements that made that film so good the character s are moronic the stupid deputy charlie phillips his dad hardy rawls cecil wearing an embarrassing wig fake moustache his air head wife melvis alix elias more besides they just plain embarrass are ridiculous i defy anyone to find any of this rancid rubbish funny basically munchies fails spectacularly at being either a comedy or horror ends up being yes you ve guessed it crap director hirsch was obviously working with a low budget here it shows the entire thing takes place in two houses the desert some caves a miniature golf course this is really cheap incompetent film making the special effects on the munchies themselves are really awful their just dolls that have no movement unless someone off camera pulls a string attached to it s arm i cannot stress how bad the effects are these things wouldn t convince my year old nephew as proved by me him yesterday total incompetence all the way this film sucks technically the film is terrible bad special effects lame production design rubbish sets well just everything s crap the acting is rotten through through from the cops to korman who has two roles both of which prove he can t act isn t funny munchies is a really bad film that fails in everything that it tries to achieve sure watch it if you want i won t stop you but just don t say you weren t warned my advice would be to watch gremlins again instead but the decision is yours
i really must watch a good movie soon because it seems every other entry or so is something that i despise however my history speaks i must not tell a lie bobby deerfield and everything about it sucks big green banana peels i never thought that i would see a film thud as thunderously as this one did al pacino isn t acting in this film he s posing there are many many scenes of his character who is a race car driver just staring at the camera he s perfectly awful marthe keller is just as bad these two are supposed to be in a love affair and there is simply no chemistry whatsoever sydney pollack directed this film there s no trace of the genius behind tootsie here is this the same man i cheered for in eyes wide shut i can hardly believe it save yourself a horrible movie experience run don t walk away from bobby deerfield
since i d seen the other three i figured i might as well catch this made for tv fourth part of the omen series as a stand alone film this movie is mediocre but as a sequel to the masterpiece it s a travesty the film goes along the same route that many series go down when they re running out of ideas that being the idea of changing the male lead to a female it s always obvious that this film was made for television as the acting is very standard the plot lacks ideas and the gruesome murder scenes seen in the previous three are kept to a bloodless minimum the film does keep a thread with the original which i won t reveal as despite being obvious that revelation is one of the most interesting aspects of the movie the basics of the plot largely copy richard donner s original and see a young couple adopt a child which they name delia not damiella or damiana fortunately there s a big dog involved and a child minder and pretty soon the wife starts to suspect that the child may not quite be normal as she s menstruating at eight years old and never suffered from any illnesses the first two sequels to the omen weren t bad at all and the series really should have ended at number three i guess there was money involved somewhere down the line as there really is no artistic reason why this film should have been made it brings nothing to the table in terms of originality and the only thing it s likely to succeed in doing is annoying fans of the series the film looks and feels like a tv movie all the way through and for the most part plays out like a film about the troubled upbringing of a young girl indeed asia vieira does look like a little bitch but she never convinces that she s the antichrist as her stares are redundant and most of the evil she does is laughable faye grant is given the meatiest role and doesn t impress while the rest of the cast regret agreeing to star in such an awful waste of time the only good thing about this movie is the theme tune which of course has been ripped off from the original and is overused on the whole this film really isn t worth seeing as it delivers nothing that the series is famous for and doesn t even do justice to weaker second sequel
strange almost all reviewers are highly positive about this movie is it because it s from and has chamberlain and curtis in it and therefore forgive the by times very bad acting and childish ways of storytelling maybe it s because some people get sentimental about this film because they have read the book i have not read the book but i don t think that s a problem film makers never presume that the viewers have read the book or is it because i am subconsciously irritated about the fact that english speaking actors try to behave as their french counterparts
i cannot see why filmmakers remade this movie the movie with mcqueen and mcgraw is almost a classic steve mcqueen was an outstanding actor and baldwin is only an inadequate actor he has no passion in his play also the action in the original getaway was fantastic but the remake has no action it is almost boring despite the fact that the film making in was more difficult than in i don t understand the way that baldwin imprisoned from mexico i think this is a mistake in the story so i think that there was no need to remake it or if they decided to remake a classic they must choose an excellent actor for the first role like johnny depp or brad pitt
when i had first heard of solar crisis then got a load of the cast i wondered why i had never heard of a movie with such a big cast before then i saw it now i know for a movie that encompasses outer space the sun vast deserts and sprawling metropolises this is an awfully cramped and claustrophobic feature it feels like everyone is hunkered close together so the camera won t have to pull too far back and the effects while good are pretty underwhelming we re talking about the imminent destruction of the planet earth if a team of scientists and soldiers cannot deflect a deadly solar flare but other than shouting sweating and a red glow about everything there s no real feel of emergency don t get me started about the cast what heston palance matheson boyle et al are doing in this movie without even bothering to act with any feel for the material is anyone s guess makes you wonder who else s condos aren t paid for in hollywood and as far as the end goes well let s just say it s tense and intriguing but it s too little too late in an effort like this if it had kept up that kind of pace all through the film maybe i would have heard of solar crisis sooner two stars mostly for lost opportunities and bad career moves i wonder how alan smithee keeps his job doing junk like this
the movie never becomes intolerable to watch and to tell it straight it has nothing to show either except maybe part sexy alicia silverstone in a nerdy non sexy character in revealing quite sexy dresses the story is very easy to follow or there s nothing to follow you can see in either way there is no suspense little action unimpressive dialogs unsatisfactory sensuality same boring locations and very bland acting kevin dillon is totally worthless silverstone well i didn t concentrate too much on her acting i confess yet as i said earlier if one has nothing to do except watching a movie this won t look so bad
this film is a twisted nonsense of a movie set in japan about a dysfunctional family who end up with a strange violent guest who just sits back and watches the members of the family at their worst nothing is sacred in this movie with sex drugs and violence stretched to such a limit i m surprised it got past the censors overall i think it will appeal only to those whom we shouldn t be encouraging rather than any supposed underlying message coming out for the rest of us to consider a film that panders to the worst element in society and is in anyway utter gash a disappointment from a man who made the sublime dead or alive and audition movies
its spelled s l a s h e r s i was happy when the main character flashed her boobs that was pretty tight before and after that the movie pretty much blows the acting is like e list and it s shown well in the movie not to mention it is so low budget that preacherman and chainsaw charlie are played by the same person the whole movie looks like it was shot with a camcorder instead of half way decent film the only other reason i liked the movie was because chainsaw charlie and doctor ripper were funny they said many stupid things that made me laugh other than that if you see this movie at blockbuster do everyone a favor hide it behind lawnmowerman anybody that thinks this movie is good should be mentally evaluated
someone will have to explain to me why every film that features poor people and adopts a pseudo gritty look is somehow seen as realistic by some people i didn t see anything realistic about the characters although the actors did their best with really bad parts or the situations instead i saw a forced self conscious effort at being edgy gritty and down and dirty sadly it takes a lot more than hand holding the camera without rhyme or reason and failing to light the film to achieve any of the above qualities in any significant way it s a sad commentary on the state of independent film distribution that the only films that see the inside of a movie theater are nowadays all carbon copies with bad cinematography non existent camera direction and a lot of swearing striving to pass themselves as art it s little wonder that films like in the bedroom or about schmidt get such raves i found them to be meandering and very average but compared to the current slew of independent clones like raising victor vargas they are outright brilliant and inspired a few years ago seeing an independent film meant that you would likely be treated to some originality and a lot of energy and care and maybe a few technical glitches caused by the low budgets nowadays it means that chances are you ll get yet another by the numbers let s shake the camera around for two hours attempt at placating the lack of taste of independent distributors and of course all that to serve characters and situations that are completely unreal and contrived is it any surprise that the independent marketplace has fewer and fewer surviving companies not at all when you see films like raising victor vargas that do nothing but copy the worst of the films that preceded them
this movie wants to elaborate that criminals are a product of modern society therefore can thieves rapists and murderers the killer of this movie carl panzram james woods is all three and worse be held fully accountable for their deeds an interesting notion but very difficult to bring to the screen in an intellectually and emotionally satisfying way and this is where killer a journal of murder falls very short although the film tries to put panzram s behaviour into perspective with flashbacks to his violent youth and dysfunctional upbringing the viewer never gets the idea that panzram is a victim rather than a culprit sure the system is corrupt with one mobster occupying the whole sick bay of leavenworth prison where most of the movie takes place most prison guards are sadistic bullies and the prison director something like a megalomaniacal despot but why on earth does new prison guard henry lesser robert sean leonard take such pity on panzram even after having read his gruesome diaries the movie offers some explanation lesser witnesses panzram being beaten to a pulp by the most sadistic and stereotypical guard and is impressed by panzram s intelligence though it isn t clear why exactly lesser thinks this man is so smart surely this isn t enough to sympathize with a hostile man like panzram even though this movie tends to downplay his crimes and highlight his personality towards lesser panzram is quite loyal and the viewer is given the impression that for lesser this outweighs all of the atrocities he has read about in panzram s diaries does this man lesser have so little friends that he takes at face value everyone who seems only remotely friendly to him perhaps it is lesser who is a product of modern society judging on appearance rather than substance i can advise monster starring charlize theron and christina ricci as a movie which handles roughly the same themes with far more integrity and scope btw killer looks as though shot for tv not so good
although this is better than the first mulva which doesn t say much anyways i would rather watch paint dry it still sucks do yourself a favor and avoid anything from these low budget pictures guys i was suckered into buying a few dvds to support some indy filmmakers and boy did i regret it some haven t even been officially released yet not bootlegs bought from the filmmakers themselves and i can t even list how bad they all are avoid anything with teen ape or bonejack in them as they do pop up in other small indy films that they are friends with if you are friends of these guys chances are you were in their movies and had fun making them but for those that had to watch them no way bad video bad audio bad acting bad plot etc etc these aren t even funny i gave this one a only because debbie rochon is in it and that is about it maybe it doesn t even deserve the about a th star to show it was slightly better than the first which i wish i could have rated in the negatives if you want a decent no budget film go pick up something from lbp s friends over at freak productions like marty jenkins or even raising the stakes those are actually decent
this movie was messed up a sequel to john carpenter s vampires this didn t add up right i m not sure that i enjoyed this much it was a little strange stick to the first vampires it s a good movie vampires los muetos wasn t a good attempt of a sequel
i ve always liked fred macmurray and although her career was tragically cut short i think carole lombard is fun to watch pair these two major and attractive stars together add top supporting players like jean dixon anthony quinn dorothy lamour and charles butterworth give them a romantic script team them with noted director mitchell leisen and you get a mediocre movie experience skid johnson fred and maggie carole meet cute during her visit to the panama canal and spend the next few weeks falling in love skid s a great trumpeter so he embarks on a musical career which is predictably meteoric in both its rise and fall during his climb to musical stardom he neglects maggie who later inspires him to start over after he s hit rock bottom ah yes it s the true hollywood happy ending which comes none too soon stars and a director of this caliber should guarantee success but this movie is so predictable and slow paced that it s difficult to watch at times the early scenes set in panama are so draggy that they seem to go on forever and later an alcoholic skid just wanders endlessly in new york fred and carole try their best but the tired script and s l o w direction just don t give them a chance even the final scene in which maggie encourages skid to rise from the ashes of alcohol and disappointment just doesn t ring true this movie should be seen once to watch some early performances from stars macmurray and lombard however i guarantee that watching it will seem to take about hours
just cause is one of those films that at first makes you wonder quite why it was so heavily slated when it came out nothing special but competent enough and with an excellent supporting performance from ed harris then you hit the last third and everything starts to get increasingly silly until you ve got a killer with a flashlight strapped to his forehead threatening to fillet sean connery s wife a typically mannered and unconvincing kate capshaw and kid a very young scarlet johannsen in an alligator skinner s shack the kind of movie that s probably best seen on a plane and even then only once
it seems that salvatores couldn t decide what to do with this movie some of it is a very weak thriller and i say very very weak some of it is an attempt to explore the relationships between the main characters both things have been tried in psychological thrillers but in this case the movie cannot hold things together due to poor superficial scripting bad acting and a too dark too dull cinematography i d say that salvatores gave his best in other genres and in other settings where he was free to look at the characters without having to think about the plot on the whole a b movie hardly worth your money vote
spoilers spoilers if one were to review the film based on the premise alone one might think that you were looking at an average animal orientated horror flick the plot is as follows a group of documentary filmmakers head off to an island in order to film a documentary about surfing with sharks or blood surfing i live in south africa so it was released as blood surf admittedly this seems to have a somewhat interesting idea behind it which if it were explored further could have improved the movie somewhat however this is not the case as the blood surfing part of the movie is minimal due to the fact that their documentary is interrupted by a rather large salt water crocodile the script is absolutely terrible a good example of this is whenever someone gets eaten by the crocodile which is a frequent occurrence in this film no one seems to give a damn the most anyone person did in the film was to merely toast the victim in a scene which was meant to be poignant but just ended up being laughable due to the fact that the dialogue in this film was of a highly dubious nature another thing that really irritates about this film is the fact that they introduce characters who are totally superfluous to the film itself they introduce a bunch of pirates who can only be seen to be adding another minutes to a mercifully short film the acting can be said to be mediocre it probably would have been a lot more impressive if they did not have such a terrible script to work from all in all there isn t one person who made a terrible impact on me every single person seemed to be a watered down caricature and in this way not one of these actors made any sort of impact on me the crocodile itself is said to be huge over feet exactly and this sense of size is well portrayed by the obvious fake of a crocodile that they have provided for us in the film the crocodile s death at the end of the film is so ridiculously fake and contrived that it makes one s stomach turn with a huge cry of bravado the hero of the film announces that he has a plan which turns out be falling down a hill and getting the crocodile to impale himself on a luckily placed spike at the bottom of this said hill all in all i would say that this film is one which has to be seen for you to believe how bad it could be what probably seemed like a good idea at the time suffered from a terrible script and an overwhelming sense of low budgetness which all served to create a truly awful movie
this is the most boring worthless piece of crap i ve ever wasted an hour of my life on all i can say is thank god it was only an hour over half of this movie is footage from the original criminally insane at the very least i was able to see the highlights from that rare exploitation classic since for some reality defying reason my video store only has criminally insane ii as it had it crazy fat ethel ii but the rest of this movie is some of the absolute worst home video acting and backyard filmmaking you ll ever see why is it my video store has this and not the original why does stuff like this actually end up in video stores why do people rent it and not immediately burn the copy once they ve seen its sheer horror why aauugghh why god why unless you enjoy seeing annoying fruits eating an entire candy bar in an excruciatingly slow scene or said fruit getting hung from the stair railing in an even slower scene or a character getting stabbed sideways don t ask multiple times in the back or brain cell murdering monologues about giving poisoned tea to one s wife and then complaining that all the talk has made one s own tea go cold or the mentally retarded eating fly soup or just simply want to see crazy fat ethel dancing with a bloody knife in a garden don t watch this movie repeat do not watch this movie do not rent this movie if at all possible do not walk past a shelf in a video store that has a copy of this movie setting on it you can still be saved but it is too late for me now
if somebody wants to make a really really bad movie wizards of the lost kingdom really sets a yardstick by which to measure the depth of badness start with the pseudo chewbacca that follows around the main character some poor schmuck in a baggy white furry costume that looks as if it was stitched together from discarded pieces of carpeting work your way slowly painfully through more not so special effects that thoroughly deny the viewer from suspension of disbelief add a garden gnome just for the heck of it on second thought skip this movie entirely and find something else to do for an hour and a half
now i myself am a lover of the b movie genre but this piece of trash insults me to no end first of all the movie is starring lizzy mcguire s brother as the annoying little kid that goes looking for his lost legged dog now please what kind of dumb ass mistakes a three legged dog for a god damn mutated crocodile please i ask you and heres another point for pondering why do they show the dinocroc on the back of the movie box being enormous and actually in the water i believe if memory serves the thing spent about minutes in the water and was just shy of feet tall that was a heart breaker but redeeming qualities to this movie were that it was so bad that i almost died laughing because believe me the bad acting made me wish for death but the fact remains that once again this thing is created by another military testing site to train super crocodiles for military combat or something like that from the source of all things evil e v i l corporation and let s not forget the characters let s see we have jerk off as the male lead and half way decent chick who doesn t know how to act as the female lead to that i say wow the only thing worse then the acting was the end of course the heroes spend about what seems like hours talking and planning some long elaborate way of killing the dinocroc only to have it fail and kill it in an ordinary way that could have taken about seconds to come up with all in all this movie was beyond gay with its random opera music in the background and the fact that it was probably the gayest of all cgi monsters ever made along with the fact it of course was impervious to bullets and bombs otherwise it wouldn t have been made for the military duh by far the best scene was when lizzy mcguire s brother runs into the shack and the dinocroc eats him causing his head to pop clean off with a popping noise i might add i believe that you would be better off shooting yourself between the eyes then to watch dinocroc and as for the director i believe that we should get a bunch of people to hang him by a noose and all take turns kicking him in the crotch for wasting an hour and a half of our lives until he finally dies and then i can go on living
it is like what the title of this thread say only impression i got from that movie is that marlee matlin s character was always angry so cynical and so pathetic her character s first date with william hurt s character where they were dancing were dumb all in all i ve tried to finish watching the movie four times and of all four times i fell asleep i would keep watching that movie with one intention to beat my problem with insomnia because all it do is to put me to sleep sweet dream
a lot of people seemed to have liked the film so i feel somewhat bad giving it a bad review but after sitting through minutes of it i feel i have to do so where the heck is the plot in this film i must have missed it i was waiting for the storyline to unfold and nothing happened sure the ending was somewhat shocking but they didn t build up to it i forgot who was who half of the time so they didn t really develop the characters the acting was so so most of the time it was believable but i was able to see through it most of the time so without giving anything away i must say that unless you like the actors in the film there is no real reason to watch this movie i could be mistaken but i just didn t understand why there was so little or too much of the film i can t decide which one that would be so i say judge for yourselves i don t even know if renting it would be a good idea the cost and all plot characters acting overall i feel like that s too high really i am staying with my vote up at the top
i had high hopes for this film i thought the premise interesting i stuck through it even though i found the acting save helena bonham carter unremarkable i kept hoping my time spent would pay off but in the end i was left me wondering why they even bothered to make this thing maybe in george orwell s version there is a message worth conveying if this film accomplished anything it has inspired me to read orwell s classic i find it hard to believe his tale could be as disappointing as this adaption if the film maker s message is the mundane life is worth living well then they ve succeeded i would recommend this film to no one minutes of my life wasted
this is just short of a full blown gore fest based on a stephen king story two tabloid reporters one seasoned miguel ferrer and one not so accomplished julie entwisle begin to believe that a serial killer michael h moss may actually be a vampire stranger than odd is this modern day blood sucker does not wing his way naturally but by way of a black cessna he seeks his victims the gore actually gets gruesome as the film nears its stupid finale keep in mind that mr king had nothing to do with this film i do admit it is a bit scary in the wee hours of the night
ten minutes worth of story stretched out into the better part of two hours when nothing of any significance had happened at the halfway point i should have left but ever hopeful i stayed and left with a feeling of guilt for having wasted the time acting was ok but the story line is so transparent and weak the script is about as lame as it could get but again stretching out the ten minute plot doesn t leave a whole lot of room for good dialogue
sometimes a movie is so comprehensively awful it has a destructive effect on your morale you begin to really ask yourself what does it mean for our society that the standard is so terribly low can they honestly expect that we ll endure this many clich s and still be entertained of course it is still a hollywood mainstay to make the gun the major character plot device and the source of all conflict and resolution in films character needs a gun gets a gun can t do that because he has a gun puts his gun down first oh my god what are we going to do he has a gun he waves it around acting more malicious than real human beings ever do he pushes it in someone s face for minutes shouting questions the hallmark of any conclusion will be the comforting sound of police sirens it s a real challenge to make such a tired hackneyed formula work again a film has to be very clever and well executed this one is neither it has no life and no personality and it will suck these components from you it will make you feel worse about living in the time and space that you do really who needs that so yes i ll say it i think this may well be the worst film i have ever seen anyone who was involved in the making of this sub mediocre soul killing trash should be publicly embarrassed for the disservice they ve done to us all
it s the f b i starring reed hadley with an all star guest cast the film begins with an accidental convenient kidnapping which leads to one thing and another which doesn t really indicate the main story which is a big house u s a prison break story the story is very improbable to say the least it s like a tv show only more violent for the times but the cast is a trip picture this ralph meeker is sent to prison his cell mates are the following criminals broderick crawford lon chaney jr charles bronson reading a muscle magazine and william talman reading a detective magazine honest you should know that an early scene reveals what happens to the missing boy answering the ending voiceover if you don t want to have that hanging don t miss the opening scenes between the iceman and the boy peter votrian doing well as a runaway asthmatic big house u s a howard w koch broderick crawford ralph meeker reed hadley
simply put this is a simplistic and one dimensional film the title the rise to evil should tell you that this isn t going to attempt to be anything deep or do much with hitler s character rather from the first minutes of the movie where we see baby hitler looking evil with evil music playing the background we are given a view of hitler that presents his as a cartoony supervillian seemingly ripped right out of a saturday morning tv show the film really wants to make its case that hitler was evil but does anyone need a movie to convince them that hitler was evil ultimately making him such a one dimensionally evil character is both boring and confusing one must ask how the inept phsycotic character in the film cold ever persuade a nation to follow him or be named time s man of the year this film had a great opportunity to take a figure who has committed some of the most horrible acts in the th century and try to delve into his mind instead it basically just says hey hitler was evil just thought you might like to know over and over again the great irony is that the film still was attacked for presenting too sympathetic a view of the character give me a break
this movie is written by charlie higson who has before this done the legendary fast show and his own show based on one of fast show s characters tony the car sales man he s also written james bond books for kids actually i ve seen before this only gordon s movies that are based on lovecraft s stories and every one of those is marvelous here gordon tries to do something different the style is totally contemporary which means shaky camera fast and strange cutting cool chillout music in the background it works quite well here i guess but it s still pointless and cheap it makes me often think of the cameraman who s shaking his dv camera in front of the actors actresses and try to make stylish moves in the pictures hoping that something tolerable would come out of it the casting is good and there is a whole atmosphere which is the result of good directing i think the main character the zero young guy is quite interesting in his zeroness the fat guy is also good and the guy who looks like alec baldwin but is not him but pretty soon after the beginning the movie turns out to be something not so interesting in this case i mean an endless line of scenes of sadism and sickness there is not much humanity in this film story it s totally pessimistic and every person in this movie is disgusting and hopeless or soon dead needless to say that there is no humor either it s a long vomit without no relief in any moment anyway gordon remains to me one of the most interesting movie makers that are active today and i think of this movie as an experiment and as a failure in that everyone has to experience getting lost sometimes just to learn and to find their way again this might be gordon s most uninteresting and empty work
this is the version that even the author hated because it s so schmaltzy they gave it a happy ending and changed a lot of the dialogue and it s just a big pile of saccharine the stage manager is quite good i believe he originated the role but everyone else falls into that acting style of the s that is really just posing the one great feature the music this has one of the best scores ever recorded and it s worth seeking out in a record shop overall i think the spalding grey eric stoltz penelope miller version is far superior
to be completely honest i haven t seen that many western films but i ve seen enough to know what a good one is this by far the worst western on the planet today first off there black people in the wild west come on who ever thought that this could be a cool off the wall movie that everyone would love were slightly no no completely retarded secondly in that day and age women especially black women were not prone to be carrying and or using guns thirdly whats with the asian chick speaking perfect english if the setting is western asia isn t where your going finally the evil gay chick was too much the movie was just crap from the beginning now don t get me wrong i m not racist or white either so don t get ticked after reading this but this movie this movie is the worst presentation of black people i have ever seen
when a film is independent and not rated such as the hamiltons i was expecting out of the norm cut out your heart violence i know that good movies don t always contain blood and violence but i read reviews i visited the website and i even convinced a few of my friends to pay to see this god awful movie with me when there is a festival called horrorfest i am expecting horror not dawsons creek with incestuous undertones my expectations were extremely low for this film yet the little expectations there was for the film were shot to hell once i saw that an hour had passed before we saw the first drop of blood come out of someones finger there were too many plot holes and left too much to the imagination i regret not seeing happy feet i think there might have been more violence and gore in that movie than in the hamiltons
sondra locke stinks in this film but then she was an awful actress anyway unfortunately she drags everyone else including then real life boyfriend clint eastwood down the drain with her but what was clint eastwood thinking when he agreed to star in this one one read of the script should have told him that this one was going to be a real snorer it s an exceptionally weak story basically no story or plot at all add in bored poor acting even from the normally good eastwood there s absolutely no action except a couple arguments and as far as i was concerned this film ranks up at the top of the heap of natural sleep enhancers wow could a film be any more boring i think watching paint dry or the grass grow might be more fun a real stinker don t bother with this one
there s nothing quite like watching giant robots doing battle over a desert wasteland and robot wars does deliver sure the acting is lousy the dialogue is sub par and the characters are one dimensional but it has giant robots the special effects themselves are actually quite good for the period they are certainly not as polished as today s standards but it contains a minimum of computer graphics and instead uses miniatures so it has aged fairly well its shortcomings are easily overlooked given the films short runtime and it does have a certain tongue in cheek humour in parts that make it quite enjoyable i would recommend this to any fan of giant robots or cheesy sci fi who is looking for a lighthearted hour of distraction
the script for this columbo film seemed to be pulled right out of a sappy s soap opera deeply character driven films are great but only if the characters are compelling and in this film the only thing compelling was my desire to change the channel the villain s dialog sounds as if it were written by a romance novelist the great lt columbo himself is no where near his famous lovable self effacing crumpled self and the bride kidnap victim is a whimpering one dimensional damsel in distress she cowers in fear from a tiny scalpel held flimsily in the hand of her abductor come on i could have knocked the scalpel out of his hand and kicked him in the you know what in seconds in any sense of reality this character would have at least tried to struggle or fight back at least a little and speaking of reality the story revolves around a kidnapping which is worked and solved by the police the police give me a break everyone knows the fbi takes over every kidnapping case this was no columbo just a shallow and totally predictable crime drama with our familiar lt columbo written in and stretched to hours
as an ex teacher i must confess to cringing through many scenes though i continued to watch to the end i wonder why boredom perhaps the initial opening scenes struck me as incredibly mish mashed and unfocussed the plot too although there were some good ideas the plight of a relief teacher for example were not concentrated enough in any one direction for d development not one of mr nolte s finer moments as to young mr macchio does he speak that way in every movie plot and acting complaints aside the hair styles alone were a nostalgic if nauseating trip
spoilers spoilers from its very opening credits this fantastic movie sets the record straight it s an instant classic it doesn t take long to realize that this movie is big bigger than kindergarten cop or police academy the sheer greatness of it left me speechless as i walked out of the movie theater and proceeded right back to the ticket counter to purchase myself another dozen of tickets this is a movie that simply requires multiple viewings the first watching will surely leave you with that strange huh feeling but don t feel embarrassed it happens to the best of us the story is so diabolically clever that one has to wonder about the mortality of its authors what seems to be a simple story of an idiot infiltrating the fbi turns out to be an allegorical story that works on several levels and teaches us all about the really important things in life the complexity of the plot structure will baffle you on your first viewing but don t give up not until my sixth or seventh viewing did i only begin to unravel some of the hidden mysteries of corky romano and watch out for the unexpected twist at the end otherwise you might be caught completely off guard when it is revealed that fbi agent brick davis is fbi s most wanted criminal corky is not a real fbi agent pops romano is innocent peter romano admits he s illiterate and paulie romano comes out of the closet as a homosexual surprised the hell out of me i can tell you that much chris kattan s comedic talents are unmatched as he leads his character corky romano through a maze of totally unpredictable situations reminiscent of john reynolds performance in manos the hands of fate kattan takes on innumerable multiple personalities and tackles all scenes with perfect comedic timing however kattan is not just about comedy he is a master of drama as well as he controls the audience s feelings with the slightest moves of his face his facial expressions reflect life itself in a way for example in the scene in which he farts into his brothers faces you can see the expression of social injustice and alienation clearly reflected on his anguished face at a moment like that it s hard to find a dry eye in the house screenwriters david garret and jason ward are the real heroes of corky romano with a story of such proportions it s easy to understand why two experienced writers had to be employed to complete this ambitious project their skillful storytelling and unorthodox structuring makes pulp fiction look like a mediocre saturday night live skit garret and ward s story is so compelling and alluring that it grips you by your hair swallows you entirely shakes you around and spits you right out at the end of the out of this world experience known as corky romano you find yourself a different person with different worldviews and different ideas and with only one question on your mind why god why
this movie was awesome not quite as good as the leif garrett masterpiece longshot but still awesome i thought ashley looked freakin huge compared to mary kate in this film i wonder why who woulda thought they could swith places like that and almost get away with it dad was kinda a jerk though and mom was a little too chummy with helmit head i give it any one who likes this movie shoudl check out longshot
it s unlikely that anyone except those who adore silent films will appreciate any of the lyrical camera work and busy but scratchy background score that accompanies this release although sound came into general use in there are no more than fifty words spoken to tell the story of a woman unhappily married who deserts her husband for a younger man after a romantic interlude in the woods the most vividly photographed scene has the jealous husband giving a lift to the young man for a ride into town proceeding to drive normally until he realizes the man is his wife s lover in a frenzy of jealousy he drives at top speed toward a railroad crossing but changes his mind at the last moment losing his nerve it s probably the most tension filled scene in the otherwise decidedly slow moving and obviously contrived story hedy lamarr is given the sort of close up treatment lavished on marlene dietrich by her discoverer but her beauty had not yet been refined by the cosmeticians as they were when she was transported to hollywood her performance consists mostly of looking sad and morose while mourning the loss of her marriage with only brief glimpses of a smile when she finds her true love aribert mog the handsome young stud who retrieves her clothes after a nude swim the swimming scene is very brief discreetly photographed and not worth all the heat it apparently generated the love making scene later on is also artfully photographed with the sort of lyrical photography evident throughout most of the film artfully so more is left to the imagination with the use of symbolism and this is the sort of thing that has others proclaiming the film is some kind of lyrical masterpiece not so it s disappointing primitively crude in its sound portions including the laborious symphonic music in the background and certainly miss lamarr is fortunate that louis b mayer saw the film and on the basis of it gave her a career in hollywood he must have seen something in her work that i didn t it s apparent that this was conceived as a silent film with the camera doing all the work the jarring workers scene at the conclusion goes on for too long and is a jarring intrusion where none is needed it fails to end the film on the proper note
much like orson welles thirty years earlier mike sarne was given the biggest train set in the world to play with but unfortunately lacked the ability to do anything more than watch his train set become a train wreck that is still spoken of with shock and a strange sort of awe despite post modern interpretations purporting somehow to see it as a gay or even feminist tract the fact of the matter is that it was a major disaster in and remains one today how anyone given the resources at mr sarne s disposal could have screwed up so royally remains a closely guarded secret only michael cimino ever came close with the political and artistic armageddon that constitutes heaven s gate both films appeared to be ego trips for their respective directors but at least mr cimino had made one of the great movies of the s before squandering the studio s largesse whereas mr sarne had only the rather fey joanna in his locker furthermore heaven s gate could boast some memorable and well handled set pieces where tragically myra breckinridge s cupboard was bare simply put it is overwhelmingly the worst example of biting the hand that feeds in the history of hollywood
the premise and subject about making a criminal realize what his victims went through by capturing his family hostage sounds promising and interesting but this is the only interesting part which was also dealt years ago with quite finesse by director ravi tandon in his film jawab too the problem here is ace director rajkumar santoshi found himself in some sort of confusion as to whether to make it a fast paced action thriller viz khakee or an emotions rich heavy duty drama viz damini and this confusion is quite evident in the final outcome if we ignore two of his pukar and lajja this brilliant director has always given us fairly engrossing films with high entertainment value therefore this film comes as a surprise as to what made this script sensitive director going for half baked characterization of both of his protagonists amitabh bachchan and aryeman as the film is getting over audience didn t know whom to hate and whom to sympathize with and this factor is the major limiting force in the complete narration therefore what starts as a war between a common man and an underworld don ends on a strange note of self realization and regret by the don about what went wrong with his own family the revelation of don s son as a real baddie does not come as a surprise element in the climax which if compared to similar situation in khakee worked so effectively with aishwarya s character that is not all there is more to it the whole dramatization of life of an underworld don operating from abroad looks quite illogical his openly landing up at mumbai from where he is suppose to be absconding as well as running after his enemies and shooting them himself does not look believable pitching a mediocre newcomer actor like aryeman opposite mr bachchan is again not a good idea but nonetheless film has some plus points ashok mehta s fine camera work two good fight sequences co ordinator abbas ali moughal some light well acted scenes of akshay kumar in the ist half santoshi s fast paced slick treatment and of course mr bachchan as usual trying hard to put some life into his lifeless character but all these put together does not make this viewing an exciting experience for you and your family
and forget this completely if you really need to see madonna act rent body of evidence at least willem defoe is in that one in this film while the sets are beautiful you may want to mute the dialog you won t miss anything bruce greenwood is wasted jeanne tripplehorn is a prop and madonna is so awful it becomes amusing why they had to butcher the original film into this mess i will never know guess they thought it was bankable madonna as an actress certainly is not if you rent the original film from though you will enjoy it and the actors in it can actually act
i saw the trailer to this film and it looked great so i went out and bought it what a mistake the acting is a shambles the special effects if you could call them that look like something that wouldn t be out of place at a school play some of the characters are so stupid in this film you will cringe the minute they are on the screen which unfortunately is all to often as for a story forget it this is a warning don t waste any money at all on this film it has to be one of the worst things i have ever seen if for some reason you like this film watch troll you will probably enjoy that as well
first of all what is good in the movie some pretty actress the exotic background the fact that the actors don t laugh while acting i would have if i had been in their situation i don t know the storyline is simple a catholic priest who does abstract painting tries to find out who another abstract painter killed his little brother a male prostitute raped by another priest when he was young i m afraid there is nothing here to learn or to let think a little about serial killers art or religion dennis hopper is not very good here this is the worst episode of the worst season of profiler the serie with replacement actors and unbelievable coincidences the uncle is the policeman who the girl who lives at another victim s house could have a baby with the priest etc etc
after what i thought was a masterful performance of two roles in man from snowy river why was kirk douglas replaced by brian dennehy in the sequel it just wasn t the same without spur and harrison as portrayed by douglas maybe he recognized how poor the plot was jim returns after extended absence to find jessica being pursued by another man he could not expect any girl to wait that long with no contact from him and not find competition for a disney movie this contains foul language plus the highly unnecessary part when jim jessica shacked up without being married very lame quite an insult to viewer intelligence according to members of my family i ll stick with the first one and try to forget i ever saw the sequel
run do not walk away from this movie aimed at the very young kids this movie will bore you to tears if the gamera trilogy of the s raised the bar this film just lowered it it s slow paced and the monster fighting is good but seldom seen this movie had me dry heaving in the cat box just a very poor offering after a phenomenal s series spoilers beyond this point here are the top reasons gamera fans of the s series will hate this film this movie is a drama that follows a kid trying to cope with the death of his mother and fears losing baby gamera to a fight after knowing his father saw the adult gamera die you see the adult gamera for maybe a minute at the beginning of the film he gets his butt kicked by a few gyaos and self destructs he looks old and lethargic plus he looks nothing like any gamera you ve ever seen his suit looked cheap and rushed the young gamera you see through the rest of the film looks like a pokemon big eyed and cute it will remind you of the baby godzilla from godzilla vs mechagodzilla gamera is now too cute this movie has the pace of watching a nascar race during a hour rain delay i watched this movie with other gamera fans and nobody was happy with how slowly this film moved along i ve seen an suv full of fat people going up a mountain road move faster like godzilla final wars this movie had very little kaiju time on screen final wars had much more actually and better fights although short kids take the title role the friend of all children theme and poor writing killed the original gamera series in the s and history repeats itself in the s the most successful gamera films abandoned the sesame street feel and went to a darker place why go back to a failed formula this was to be a new trilogy and poor ticket sales killed any hope for this story to continue thank god gamera lost his iconic roar he now sounds like an elephant with strep throat this movie may produce a new olympic event imagine a relay race that involves sending very young children into harm s way you have to see the ending to understand this point where were the parents oh yea right there sending their kids into a kaiju battle zone the special effects were good but sub par for a gamera movie legion and iris had better effects the best effect was showing the apple sized baby gamera fly not too impressive this movie is just not what adult kaiju fans come to expect the director was involved in power rangers and it shows it comes off like a cross between et always sunset on third street and tmnt kudos if you know all references rental at best or watch once if you buy it to complete the dvd series
nothing will ruin a movie as much as the combination of a poor script and poor direction this is the case with the mummy s tomb the script is leftover ideas from older better universal horror flicks like dracula and frankenstein the direction is trite and stale the acting is mediocre even chaney s kharis is feeble compared to tom tyler s in the mummy s hand and the producers are foolish enough to add footage from christy cabanne s vastly better prequel and point up the weakness of their own film universal realized how bad this movie was and essentially remade it from scratch two years later as the mummy s ghost with a much better script and better director the result was likely the best film in their four film mummy cycle although not anywhere near as good as karl freund s original cabanne s footage raises this film to a the new stuff is a at best dick foran and wallace ford were probably glad to see their characters bumped off so they wouldn t have to appear in dreck like this anymore
a lot of themes or parts of the story is the same as in leon then other parts felt like some other movie i don t know which but there are an familiar feeling over the whole movie it was kind of nice to watch but it would have been fantastic if the story would have been more original the theme little girl bad assassin from leon is just tweaked a little the opening scenes are really good it is strange that people like to fight in the kitchen in the movies my biggest problem was to remember which parts was from leon nikita and if they where from the french or american version if you have not seen leon then this is a good movie if you liked this movie then i can recommend leon best regards rick
you know what kind of movie you re getting into when the serial killer main character is being transported to the electric chair in what seems to be a bakery truck only to have the prison vehicle collide with and i m not making this up a genetic engineering tanker truck the goo which spurts forth melts him and fuses his dna with the snow creating our protagonist the killer snowman my favorite portion of the movie however is an over the shoulder shot of the snowman thrashing some poor schmuck in which his hands look suspiciously like a couple of white oven potholder gloves mmmmm schlock
the plot doesn t offer any new excitements it even starts the same as cube i this time there are no other enhancements for the cube machinery except for having an extra exit which is not guarded very ingenious the characters are also not so well elaborated as in the first episode they just became flat as in a soap opera if somebody makes it to the normal exit the person would be asked some questions like do you believe in god its not really creative or original and especially in my opinion it doesn t fit into the mystery of the cube with it traps really there is nothing much else to say about it
the brain machine will at least put your own brain into overdrive trying to figure out what it s all about four subjects of varying backgrounds and intelligence level have been selected for an experiment described by one of the researchers as a scientific study of man and environment since the only common denominator among them is the fact that they each have no known family should have been a tip off none of them will be missed the whole affair is supervised by a mysterious creep known only as the general but it seems he s taking his direction from a senator who wishes to remain anonymous good call there on the senator s part there s also a shadowy guard that the camera constantly zooms in on who later claims he doesn t take his direction from the general or the project too bad he wasn t more effective he was overpowered rather easily before the whole thing went kablooey if nothing else the film is a veritable treasure trove of s technology featuring repeated shots of dial phones room size computers and a teletype machine that won t quit perhaps that was the basis of the film s alternate title time warp nothing else would make any sense as for myself i d like to consider a title suggested by the murdered dr krisner s experiment titled group stress project it applies to the film s actors and viewers alike keep an eye out just above the general s head at poolside when he asks an agent for his weapon a boom mic is visible above his head for a number of seconds you may want to catch this flick if you re a die hard gerald mcraney fan could he have ever been that young james best also appears in a somewhat uncharacteristic role as a cryptic reverend but don t call him father for something a little more up his alley try to get your hands on s the killer shrews that one at least doesn t pretend to take itself so seriously
ok i m not an american but in my humble scottish opinion steve martin is not never has been and never will be a funny man as long as our posteriors point in a southerly direction phil silvers as sergeant bilko was a funny man no doubt due to the skilled writers and directors and all the other talented team working characters in the series who contributed perfectly to one of the funniest and dateless situation comedies america has ever produced how anyone could have the audacity to even attempt to replicate the phil silvers character is beyond me to compound things the exercise was repeated in martin s unfunny attempt to be peter seller s inspector clouseau another abortive attempt in my opinion to rekindle a demonstrably unfunny career some of your contributers say steve martin puts his own stamp on the character to that i would say balderdash his portrayals will be long forgotten when those of silvers and sellars will be treasured for generations to come
this movie was recently released on dvd in the us and i finally got the chance to see this hard to find gem it even came with original theatrical previews of other italian horror classics like spasmo and beyond the darkness unfortunately the previews were the best thing about this movie zombi in a bizarre way is actually linked to the infamous lucio fulci zombie franchise which began in similarly compared to zombie zombi consists of a threadbare plot and a handful of extremely bad actors that keeps this horror trash barely afloat the gore is nearly non existent unless one is frightened of people running around with green moss on their faces and the english dubbing is a notch below embarrassing the plot this time around involves some sort of covert military operation with a bunch of inept scientists ie an idiotic male and his stupid female side kick who are developing some sort of chemical called death one that is supposed to re animate the dead unless my ears need to be checked i don t even recall a reason for the research of death one it seems to exist only to wreak havoc upon the poor souls who made the mistake of choosing to star in this cinematic laugh fest anyway death one is experimented on a corpse whom i swear looked like yul brynner and after it is injected into his system he sits upright and his head explodes the sound effects are also quite hilarious as the corpse s face bubbles with green slime the sound of paper crumpling can be heard the death one toxin is transported outside and is hi jacked by a group of thieves where one makes off with it but infects himself after cutting himself on an exposed vial needless to say the guy turns into a zombie but not before he makes his timely escape to a cheap motel infects a lowly porter and murders a maid by pushing her face into a bathroom mirror the military catch wind of this and immediately take action before eliminating everyone who is unlucky enough to be within the contamination zone and turn the motel upside down they find the infected thief and burn his body only to have the smoke infect a flock of birds that are flying over the chimney stack we cut to the introduction of a group of men who are on leave from the army listening to groovy music that is coming out of a little dinky boom box while trailing a trailer load of slutty girls who are leaning out of the windows and showing off their chests can someone say zombie food we also have a sub plot involving a girl and her boyfriend driving a car who stop to inspect a group of birds lying on the road the same birds that were infected by the zombie smoke the birds attack the boyfriend and the girl drives off to a deserted gas station to seek water this is one of the most incredibly hilarious moments of the movie she walks around this old dirty rusty and obviously abandoned building where she continues to ask aloud hello is there anyone here please i just need some water she encounters a group of zombies one of which is chained to a wall and the other is swinging a machete after a bit of rumbling and tumbling around on the ground she escapes but not before blowing up the gas station with her lighter meanwhile the birds attack the trailer load of whores and one girl gets pecked and infected they all pull up to the same motel where the original infection took place and this is where the second most hilarious moment of the film takes place after a matter of hours a day at the most the same motel is now caked in dust has vines growing throughout it and looks like it has been sitting derelict for years anyway what better place to take refuge than this particular building needless to say the group begins to break down as several people walk off together to get themselves stuck in an incredibly stupid situation involving a zombie attack the third most hilarious moment concerns a man and a woman who explore a deserted village of which the woman comments this place is a dump she then proceeds to get pushed off a balcony by a zombie into pirahna infested water where she has her legs bitten off and turns into a zombie within seconds meanwhile her friend back at the motel who got pecked and infected hours earlier is still turning into a zombie unfortunately there are just too many inconsistencies in this movie that makes this movie just too stupid for words for example the time rate concerning infected people being zombified differs greatly sometimes it takes seconds other times it takes hours some zombies run others drag their feet and walk really slow some even do kung fu moves while others hide under stacks of hay to surprise people some of the zombies even talk the funniest moment of course is the infamous zombie head in the fridge gag which elevates itself in mid air and attacks a stupid man who goes looking for food funnily enough his girlfriend gets her throat torn out by it s headless counter part lmao the biggest disappointment for me though was the lack of story lines involving the people who are in fact killed by zombies we never get to see them come back as zombies in fact the only ones we do see zombified are the ones pecked by the birds and the one girl who gets her legs bitten off other than that i was at least expecting the couple who were killed in the kitchen and or the guy who was killed on the bridge to come back as zombies it is also amazing that these zombies only take a few bites and then move on to their next victim the most laughable moment was of course the zombie fetus a pregnant woman who has been infected lies on a bed in a hospital a woman who seems to have a lot of medical knowledge tries to deliver the baby and has her face pulled off by a zombie before having her head pushed into the woman s stomach where a hand bursts out and proceeds to rip the rest of her face off timeless as usual all the characters are perfect stereotypes of this genre the megalomaniacal military officer the pathetic useless squealing women who scream to get killed the obvious characters who are about to get killed ie watch for the man chasing a chicken i guess this movie really is a comedy there were many laughable scenes such as the shed that gets blown up with a hand grenade obviously the scene where the entire budget was spent and a climatic scene where a man screams i m thirsty thirsty for your blood the costumes are really bad the same zombies reappear throughout the course of the film wearing the same asian like clothing that may be found in a bruce lee film and watch out for the blue s skirt the girl at the motel is wearing when she and her boyfriend bump into the infected man the end of the film leaves open the door as usual for the apocalyptic story line a radio dj who narrates throughout the whole movie turns out to be a zombie himself and warns his listeners about the beginning of the end while the two survivors take off in a helicopter hardly dawn of the dead material if you ask me regardless this movie does deliver many laughs the gore is minimal and what gore there is it is very unconvincing let alone unimaginative the usual mix of black blood thick green goo oozing out of weeping sores and zombie make up consisting of green moss zombi makes for a good rental for a sleep over party or a night of beer and popcorn other than that horror fans should stay away out of
the brain or head that wouldn t die is one of the more thoughtful low budget exploitation films of the early s it is very difficult to imagine how a script this repulsively sexist could have been written without the intention of self parody and the themes that are expressed repeatedly by the female lead ginny leith a detached head kept alive by machines i vs and clamps seem to confirm that the film was meant to simultaneously exploit and critique gender stereotypes shades of the under rated boxing helena the genderisms are plentiful and about as irritating as an army of angry ants the dialog is hyperbolic over dramatic and unbelievable and the acting is merely ok but not consistent why have i given this film a because some thought clearly went into it i am really not sure what point the film was really trying to make but it seems clear that it strives for an unusually edgy and raw sort of horror without the blood and guts today s audiences expect another unique and interesting aspect of the brain is that there really are not any heroes in this film and none of the characters are particularly likable all considered this is a fairly painful and disturbing look at early s american pop sexuality from the viewpoint of a woman kept alive despite her missing body after what should have been a fatal car crash her lover is threatening to sew a fresh high quality body onto her and force her to continue living with him she is understandably non plussed by all of this and forced to befriend a creature who is almost as monstrous as her boyfriend oh there are also some vague references to the s s clich about the evils of science run amok recommended for b sci fi buffs and graduate students in gender studies o w not recommended
first of all let me say that this is not the movie for people looking to watch something spirited and joyous for the holidays this movie is cold brutal and just downright depressing mary steenburgen plays a grinchy mom who is down on christmas because her husband has lost his job they are losing their house can t buy christmas presents for the kids etc you get the idea happy stuff for the holidays so along comes harry dean stanton as gideon the christmas angel who in his dark hat and long overcoat comes off more like a pedophile who hangs around children all day observing them what better way to instill the spirit of christmas in mary steenburgen than to kill off her family and then offer to bring them back if she believes in christmas again santa claus is a blackmailer and his christmas workshop looks more like a haven for refugee nazis on the lam the movie lays everything on so thick that you don t care about the happy ending when it comes because the rest of the movie is so bitter and unbelievable i m sure this film wanted to be something capra like but it left out the joy and sentiment on what a holiday film should be
i ve seen this film because i had do my job includes seeing movies of all kinds i couldn t stop thinking who gave money to make such an awful film and also submit it to cannes festival it wasn t only boring the actors were awful as well it was one of the worst movies i ve ever seen
the s were a time of change and awakening for most people social upheaval and unrest were commonplace as people spoke out about their views racial tensions politics the vietnam war sexual promiscuity and drug use were all part of the daily fabric and the daily news this film attempted to encapsulate these historical aspects into an entertaining movie and largely succeeded in this film two families are followed one white one black during the first half of the film the story follows each family on a equal basis through social and family struggles unfortunately the second half of the movie is nearly dedicated to the white family admittedly there are more characters in this family and the story lines are intermingled but equal consideration is not given to the racial aspects of this century on the whole the acting is well done and historical footage is mixed with color and black and white original footage to give a documentary feel to the movie the movie is a work of fiction but clips of well known historical figures are used to set the time line i enjoyed the movie but the situations were predictable and the storyline was one sided
mojo is a story of fifties london a world of budding rock stars violence and forced homosexuality mojo uses a technique for shooting the s often seen in films that stresses the physical differences to our own time but also represents dialogue in a highly exaggerated fashion owing much to the way that speech was represented in films made in that period i have no idea if people actually spoke like this outside of the movies but no films made today and set in contemporary times use such stylised language it s as if the stilted discourse of s screenwriters serves a common shorthand for a past that seems in consequence a very distant country indeed and therefore stresses the particular rather than the universal in the story mojo features a strong performance from ian hart and annoying ones from aiden gillan and ewan bremner the latter still struggling to build a post trainspotting career but feels like a period piece a modern film incomprehensibly structured in an outdated idiom rather dull actually
well the reason for seeing it in the cinema was that it was a sneak preview else i would never have seen this terrible teenage slasher movie i mean haven t we had enough of this yet scream and scary movie at least did not take them self serious the plot sucks and the acting is the worst i ve seen only godzilla can compare which is also the only movie that competes in being the worst i ve seen in the cinema with this one there is so many plot holes in the story and the girls are so alike that you don t even now who has been killed and who has not and you don t care the only of them i knew in advance was denise and she was the most talent less actress i have ever seen in this bad excuse for a movie stay as far away from this movie as possible
this movie should be nominated for a new genre complete mess except for a few chuckles and one or two scenes of gore this movie is a complete waste of time calling it campy doesn t even cut it campy implies fun which this movie was not you spend the first half of the movie thinking its got to get better right in fairness it does at the very end when its finally explained who the brother sister team are and what they want but by then you hardly care anymore because you ve spend the entire second half of the movie wondering exactly what did mr onorati ms pacula do to tick someone off this badly to be stuck in such a horrible movie
few films have left me with such a feeling of unease and this is not a compliment since i saw it in a theater how it ended there i can only wonder i was subjected to mn of hateful derivative garbage the main impression being a bit like this other sick o movie don t answer the phone but worse the nastiness of it all rape and all is shown without any distance unlike strong stuff like last house on the left and utter contempt for the perfect victims and everybody involved leaving the viewer to be treated as a sadistic voyeur at the end i felt like taking a shower no credits to the director
i don t know why but i thought i ve seen this movie before maybe it was the name maybe it was the way poster looked i don t know anyway it was quite promising in the beginning and even throughout the whole feature there were some bright moments maybe its because i m not a huge fan of the horrors and i don t watch them a lot but this one actually looked fresh sometimes but the rest of it is not so good laughable at times the movie is slow paced sometimes you will get so bored you d forget what was the story about characters are not great either all of them the butcher is ok seems creepy and crazy enough although i didn t get what were those weird looking things on his chest that whole scene just looked fake and kind of out of the blue and why he was collecting those in jars at home the main lead is plain his character is really hard to believe in and very undeveloped but i guess thats scenarists fault like why he cried when he was taking pictures of his girlfriend side cast is bad too but the main thing i hated in this movie was the girl my god when will women in horror movies have any brains its ridiculous the girl finds out that a maniac took her boyfriends camera tries going to police that fails and then she thinks of the best idea ever why don t we just go and take it i know where the maniac lives yup thats swell and then look for the camera in the bathroom why not and then walk in the room see a bag that was not there before and just have a look inside maybe camera is there not there but loads of interesting stuff shiny mmmm to realize that bag means that the butcher came back is too hard for her tiny tiny brain then of course the never ending falling while running away trick that really made it look bad then to put the final nail into the character in the end of the movie she walks into the wagon full with dead bodies hanging feet up screams noooo like she just ripped her gucci bag and walks further into the wagon jeez come on no one else thinks its just well stupid just awful if her character wasn t so bad maybe the movie would get another star or two from me and i would even forgive mmt characters that can take a hit in the head with a steel hammer that dude in the train who the conductor killed butcher vests that can protect from bullets weird and cheap looking monsters in the end i didn t read clive barkers novel so i have no idea where those monsters came from the fact that no one cared that hundreds judging on the skeletons in the dungeon disappeared in the city and main character that didn t bleed to death when he got his tongue ripped out he barely noticed it i guess oh and the predictable ending damn i knew the ending half way in its just disappointing the only reason i m still giving some credit to the makers is that the movie in general looks better than most of the horrors i ve watched past few months visual style is nice some shots were really nice and good cgi that made the killings look really brutal although blood didn t look real at all i guess some people will enjoy it some like me will watch it if there is nothing else to watch some will absolutely hate it
how in the name of all that s holy did this film ever get distribution it looks as if it has been shot on someone s mobile phone and takes the screaming girl victim scenario to whole new depths they literally scream for the full minutes of the movie and that s all they do there is no plot no tension no characters and not a lot of acting just screaming and more screaming i gave up after fifteen minutes and fast wound through it to see if anything happened it doesn t except for screaming of course odlly enough the act of going through it on fast forward highlights another problem there is no camera work to speak of every shot looks like every other shot middle distance one angle dull dull dull it s not so bad it s good it s just plain bad
we have an average family dad s a famous rapper we have the rebelious teenage daughter the adopted white kid and the cute little kid and we have careless housemaid what show has had a housemaid like that do we have a messed up brady bunch yay when it first came out i thought it was really cool mostly because i was young the music was bad the raps were so bad and they were too g rated all of his raps were about his family and friends and problems the dad was kind of the danny from full house type of dad always gave the advice out but he wasn t a clean freak they had a house keeper for that remember the plots were basically lil romeo was in trouble of some sort or not that s it oh and maybe some preteen drama yeah that stuff is good not really but its still a good show for kids but nikelodean could do better
this documentary is a reenactment of the last few years of betty page s paige richards career the tennessee tease was the most recognizable pin up queen in history her most memorable work came in the s and was fetish photos bondage and cat fight girly flicks irving klaw dukey flyswatter at his movie star news instructed betty on what to do in front of the camera there was no nudity in the famous photos or stag films but nonetheless klaw was charged with distributing obscene materials and was ordered to destroy them to avoid prosecution it is no surprise that betty had a cult following at the height of her career the girl next door with jet black hair blue eyes and an hour glass figure dressed in fetish gear or not would mesmerize for decades after all it has been said that she was photographed more than marilyn monroe and second only to the most photographed image in the world elvis presley betty page would disappear and devote her last years to religion this movie actually could have been a lot better but good enough to hold interest miss richards is stunning in her own right bra panties garter belt and hose do not hurt her image in the least also in the cast jaimie henkin jana strain emily marilyn and julie simone be advised this movie can change your heart rate
it took years to complete this film i would think that within those years someone would have said hey this film is terrible i ve seen better acting in porn movies the story is tired and played abused child turns into serial killer how about something new for a change how about abused child turns into a florist at least that would have been a new twist why is it that everyone with a camera and a movie idea especially unoriginal movie ideas thinks that they can be a director i do admire the fact that they stuck with this film for years to get it completed that shows tenacity and spirit with this kind of drive hopefully next time they can focus it on a better script if you want to see a failed experiment in indie film making from a writer director from michigan see hatred of a minute if you want a good movie from a michigan writer director stick with evil dead
it s obvious that the people who made dead at the box office love b movie horror overt references to the genre are peppered throughout from stock characters the authority figure who doesn t believe the monstrous invasion is really happening to kevin smith style discussions to reenacting duane jones last moments from night of the living dead not once but twice unfortunately it takes more than love to make a good movie the staging and shot choice are unexciting and unimaginative while a common admonition in film school is to avoid mastershot theatre telling the story completely in a wide master shot here we find the obverse as in several sequences it s hard to figure out the spatial relationships between characters as the story is told in a series of medium shots with no establishing shot to tie it together editing is drab and basic and at times there are unmotivated cuts the lighting is flat and sometimes muddy making the scenes in the darkened theatre hard to make out was there lighting or was this shot with available light only some shots are out of focus the dialogue is trite and the performances for the most part one note isaiah robinson shows some energy and screen presence as curtis and the fellow playing the projectionist has some pleasantly dickish line readings michael allen williams as the theater manager and casey kirkpatrick as enthusiastic film geek eric have some nice moments the premise is silly even for a b horror flick also it s too bad dr eisner was unaware of project paperclip he could ve saved himself a lot of trouble the zombies are non threatening and their makeup is unconvincing although the chunky zombie trying to get a gumball out of the machine raised a smile for a zombie fan film there is very little blood or violence although what there is is handled pretty well the incidental music while stylistically uneven is kind of nice at times and there are some good foley effects the time warp parody was a fun listen although the images going along with it were less fun to watch unfortunately the looped dialogue sounds flat was this shot non sync doubtful it looks like video through and through i watched the special introduction by troma films lloyd kaufman before the main feature although it consisted essentially of kaufman plugging his own stuff and admitting that he hadn t seen the movie while someone mugged in a toxie mask its production and entertainment values were higher than dead itself quick aside to whoever put the dvd together the countdown on film leader beeps only on the flash frame not on every number plus one more after for that matter the vampire film theatregoers are seen watching early in dead looked a lot more entertaining than this recommendation to avoid unless you know someone involved in the production or are an ardent lloyd kaufman completist he plays kaufman the minion in the film within a film full disclosure my girlfriend is an extra in this movie i swear this did not color my review
a group of us watched this film are were really disgusted we were willing to forgive the fact that our favorite character jo wasn t on it s not like the writers producers could do anything about that the writing was poor the script was sub par what really annoyed us when the two guys realized they were both dating natalie they didn t just leave they put up with that stupid and ultimately degrading contest but only because they were macho competing guys not because they really wanted natalie despite being unable to choose between the two guys before the reunion natalie suddenly decides that she really loves one of the guys and is now ready to marry him and there was no foreshadowing that he was really a better guy it s as if the writers flipped a coin and then just had her spit it out at some convenient point in the film blair makes a point of talking about how she does not want children and then all of a sudden when her husband says he wants to have children she blissfully agrees with him
my friend bought the movie for its is not even cent worth because they wrote it was like american pie but we would soon find out that there is a long way from american pie to that piece of crap it is not even a comedy its more like a really really really bad documentary not only the story is bad the picture and sound also sucks to they put in some alcohol chicks dwarfs and drunken teens and the result is a disaster if you see this movie don t buy it rather spend your money on something else and better if you are gonna torture yourself then don t invite your friend s unless you hate really much and you want to get rid of them
dreary schlocky just plain dreadful and awful let s be honest when you sit down to watch something called the double d avenger you aren t expecting great art or even mild mainstream entertainment you are probably expecting a cult film type and maybe get some good looks at some impressive busts you don t get really either of these in the video the story as it consistent with most of these types is inane kitten natividad runs a local pub finds out she has breast cancer flies down to south america for a fruit that claims to be a panacea for any ills and a super human abilities giver returns and fights dressed as the double d avenger a group from a local strip club wanting to edge out the competition as stories go i have seen a lot worse but as another reviewer noted the execution is horrendous the action sequences lack zip drive motivation and are tissue thin the acting isn t even properly campy and the dialog is the pits nothing and i mean nothing is funny from the wincing puns to the heavy handed boob references all could be forgiven if the girls could make up for it but they all fall way short kitten haji and raven de la croix are all quite older still lovely in their own ways yet expose nothing and become the antithesis of what they are trying to be older campy caricatures of their former selves instead they look so lame and desperate more because of the vehicle they are starring in rather than their own abilities there are some other lovely ladies but you really do not see much of anything pg definitely could be an appropriate rating for this the material the actresses and director are all tired tiresome and dated and again not funny it was a brutal hour plus sitting through this and that is a shame as i was expecting something campy and fun the guy playing bubba by the way was the only real laugh for me not that he was good at all mind you but every time he opened his mouth i kept thinking how truly awful he was the lone bright spot here at all is seeing mr sci fi himself forrest j ackerman play the curator of a wax museum and chatting to his wax frankenstein affectionately called frankie other than that this is a complete bust now how is that for another tired dreadful trite pun
i was very displeased with this move everything was terrible from the start the comedy was unhumorous the action overdone the songs unmelodious even the storyline was weightless from a writer who has written successful scripts like guru and dhoom i had high expectations the actors worked way too hard and did not help the film at all of course kareena rocked the screen in a bikini but for two seconds i think hindi stunt directors should research how action movies are done they tend to exaggerate way too much in chinese films this style works because that is their signature piece but hindi cinema s signature are the songs a good action movie should last no more than two hours and cannot look unrealistic but in the future i m sure these action movies will get much sharper also to be noted comedy and action films do not mix unless done properly good luck next time
let me start by saying that i understand that invasion of the star creatures was meant to be a parody of the sci fi films of the s i understand that none of it is to be taken seriously the problem i have is that none of it works a parody should be funny and this one just isn t not once during the entire runtime did i so much as crack a smile in general i am easily entertained but i couldn t find a sliver of entertainment anywhere in invasion of the star creatures i knew i was in trouble right from the beginning the two stars make their screen appearance with one of the lamest gags imaginable a water hose they can t control that gets them both wet these two come off as bowery boys wannabes why anyone would want to mime the act and persona of the bowery boys is beyond me after the less than illustrious beginning the movies goes on to feature comical chase sequences dancing indians vegetable men decoder rings and other assorted unfunny bits it s all just a complete waste of time i bought this on the double feature dvd with invasion of the bee girls that movie is academy award winning stuff in comparison with invasion of the star creatures
so thinner yep this steven bachman read steven king yarn about a man who gets his just desserts from a gypsy elder who he just killed the story itself is there no doubt about it but i don t know why i didn t enjoy it more than i could have i guess what really distracted me was the actors i mean who s the lead robert john burke who s he and fer crying out loud can someone please stop hiring joseph mantegna for every italian mafioso role there ever is and while we re at it does every mafioso have to have a pasta cooking italian mother the only good acting job done here is under pounds of makeup michael constantine as the gypsy elder he s pretty good but the rest i make you all better actors
despite being released on dvd by blue underground some five years ago i have never come across this italian sword and sorcery item on late night italian tv and now that i have seen it for myself i know exactly why not because of its director s typical predilection for extreme gore of which there is some examples to be sure or the fact that the handful of women in it parade topless all the time it is set in the dark ages after all it is quite simply very poor stuff indeed in fact i would go so far as to say that it may very well be the worst of its kind that i have yet seen and believe me i have seen plenty especially in the last few years i e following my excursion to the venice film festival reading about how the film s failure at the time of initial release is believed to have led to its director s subsequent and regrettable career nosedive into mindless low budget gore i can see their point i may prefer fulci s earlier giallo period to his more popular stuff horror myself but even on the latter his commitment was arguably unquestionable on the other hand conquest seems not to have inspired fulci in the least seeing how he decided to drape the proceedings with an annoyingly perpetual mist sprinkle it with incongruent characters cannibals vs werewolves anyone irrelevant gore we are treated to a gratuitous nasty cannibal dinner just before witnessing the flesh eating revelers having their brains literally beaten out by their hairy antagonists and even some highly unappetizing intimacy between the masked brain slurping villainess don t ask and her slimy reptilian pet for what it is worth we have two heroes for the price of one here a young magic bow carrying boy on some manhood affirming odyssey andrea occhipinti and his rambling muscle bound companion jorge rivero i e frenchy from howard hawks rio lobo who despite being called mace short for maciste perhaps seems to be there simply to drop in on his cavewoman from time to time and get his younger prot g out of trouble particularly during an exceedingly unpleasant attack of the boils unfortunately even the usual saving grace of such lowbrow material comes up short here as ex goblin claudio simonetti s electronic score seems awfully inappropriate at times fulci even contrives to give the film a laughably hurried coda with the surviving beefy hero going aimlessly out into the wilderness after defeating one and all with the aid of the all important magic bow so much for his own supposed physical strength onto his next and thankfully unfilmed adventure
hollywood does it again lots of money no creativity i m sure the writers were on something other than oxygen when they wrote this one based on the previews i thought that this would be a funny movie but if you are not up on the latest stupid pop culture then you ll miss most of the silly humor in this movie why waste your time you can sit on a log doing nothing and have more fun than this movie will provide
well what can you say about a barbara cartland adaptation there are some amazing actors in this oliver reed sarah miles christopher plummer but they clearly are clocking up the money lysette anthony and marcus gilbert have appeared in two other cartland epics anthony with hugh grant who looks suitably embarrassed and gilbert with helena bonham carter if you really want to see a watchable adaptation of cartland the bonham carter one is the one to go for a hazard of hearts what a title gilbert is the weak link in that but bonham carter is suitably beautiful and of course can actually act and the rest of the cast play it to the hilt with tongues firmly in cheek edward fox diana rigg
honestly this is easily in the top of the worst movies i have ever seen partly because it takes itself so seriously as opposed to regular light hearted trash this movies wants you to be emotionally involved to feel for the characters and to care about the alleged conspiracy none of this ever even comes close to happening mild spoilers there are main reasons why this movie is so terrible incoherent and totally non sensical plot annoying style over substance mtv camerawork moronic characters and plot holes allow me to elaborate apparently when this movies was being made they couldn t decide whether to make a movie about church conspiracies the stigmata or possession so guess what they combined them an aetheist gets possessed by a dead person who then makes her exhibit the stigmata so as to expose a church conspiracy how a regular person is able to transcend death and possess another human being through his rosary is never explained nor even talked about now instead of just saying what he wants to say he gives her the stigmata why why not just spit it out instead we get treated to scenes of screaming things in harsh voices carving cryptic messages on cars and writing messages on walls apparently this priest was also a violent guy because the possessed young lady also wigs out on one o f the characters while talking in that cliched harsh possessed voice that we all have heard countless times this also starts to tie into my second complaint because whenever the young lady gets the stigmata she also defies the laws of gravity by floating into the air and tossing everything and everybody around her as if they were in an earthquake why does this happen who knows my guess is that the director thought it looked cool this movies contains dozens of shots in slow motion of course of birds showing up out of nowhere and flying off and most annoyingly of water dripping this woman s apartment is constantly dripping water constantly logically the place would probably fall apart with this many holes to sum up this complaint towards the end and for absolutely no reason the camera cuts to shots of water dripping in slow motion in reverse why i have no idea it has no relevance to anything and once again i m betting it s because the director thought it looked cool one of the main characters says he became a priest to explain away holes in science this doesn t make sense to me i would think that going to church would be enough but no he has to go through the entire rigamarole of becoming a priest i just don t buy it secondly there are lots of plot holes a few of which i will elaborate on below for starters when she first gets the stigmata the scene ends with her laying unconscious bleeding next she s in the hospital who called the ambulance another one is towards the end when the previously mentioned scientific priest character is talking to the spirit who is possessing the girl he says take me as your messenger not a word for word quote but you get the idea his response you have no faith only doubt so because of this he possesses an aetheist an aetheist has no faith far less then any scientific priest and then there s the fact that the object of this movie s conspiracy this lost gospel of st thomas i believe is available at local bookstores the characters are willing to kill to supress this document but you could walk down to a bookstore and buy it maybe this is supposed to take place in an alternate history where it isn t wide known but the movie never tries to tell us this or to even hint that this is an alternate happening of that document s uncovering in closing this movie is terrible to a spectacular degree it is my arch nemesis which i feel the need to insult every chance i get i loathe it final grade f
what the bleep do we know is a deluded and haphazard look at the mysteries of the universe we are presented with a parade of apparent experts none of whom are named who ramble and pontificate in a thoroughly unscientific manner their interviews are chopped up into aggravatingly small segments and dispersed throughout some flashy cgi and banal mini plots the film pilfers themes from science philosophy theology and politics minces them together without any regard for accuracy and then somehow extracts a few prosaic and absurd conclusions we are led to believe that quantum physics is telling us the purpose of our existence and any other difficult to answer question the film makers would like to point their finger at it is riddled errors and logical non sequiturs how did we start at quantum mechanics and end up with this pseudo scientific spirituality and mysticism it s like saying two plus two equals four therefore i can move objects with my mind there is nothing original in this film and almost nothing that is accurate any discriminating viewer will be annoyed by heavy handed editing intrusive and pointless special effects and general lack of substance educated viewers will be frustrated to tears by the violence done to science and every other subject this film touches on
a text prologue warns us that we should not allow evil to enter our house but i think the more apt word is entropy good grief what slobs these two babes are george seymour cassell is alone in his san francisco office and his monstrously expensive home in tiburon while his wife and child are away in san diego two girls sondra locke as jackson and colleen camp as donna knock on his door asking directions well it s raining and they re shivering like two drenched pitiful kittens and they re not sure of the address they re looking for and what with one thing and another george invites them to come in and partake of his pizza by the fire all three of them wind up in george s bath tub and there follows about five minutes of mostly undifferentiated nudity in double exposure triple exposure quadruple exposure and dodekakuple exposure they spend the night in a threesome and the next morning the girls fix him breakfast but something has gotten slightly cockeyed because georgie s guests gobble everything down with their fingers and pour ketchup and syrup all over the linen and you eat like animals george exclaims and tells them to get out in his dreams now don t get me wrong sondra locke is an extraordinary looking young blond with cobalt blue eyes and colleen camp bounces around like a superball you gotta say they breed em mighty cute down there in shelbyville tennessee where locke comes from and they breed em with bodacious tushes too as we can t help but note after the first five or ten minutes but when the girls go berserk so does the movie the film is thereafter bathed in a garish green light the pair put on ghoulish makeup and make gargoyle faces at themselves in the mirrors they brain a delivery boy and then drown him to make sure they cuss up a storm and smash windows and furniture they have one of those scenes in which two people sit across the table from one another licking food and then jumping each other s bones and georgie they first render georgie unconscious with mace which contains nothing that you can t find in that little red bottle of mcilheny s tabasco sauce in your kitchen cabinet tie him up pour flour and milk all over him subject him to a psychotic trial put him through one of those tolstoy type semi executions slap him around dress up in outlandish costumes then prance out on him and his virtually destroyed upper middle class home and are dispatched by a delivery van ex machina as for the acting it s as if someone had told georgie first act polite to these girls then act panicked after you re tied up and to the girls first act shy unwilling to impose on anyone then act crazy and that s it the photography and location work are straight out of a s porn movie i m not sure that suggests a total lack of skill it takes effort and talent to turn san francisco ugly the score gives us two leitmotivs georgie s is some pop tune with lyrics about being free and giving in jackson and donna s is a catchy rinky tink thing called my good old dad i approve of the moral lesson behind the story though there are some things you should simply not give in to even though they might look like a lot of fun at first all very educational
a group of models is seeking an apartment to live in and are shown one by a local real estate agent unknown to the models and the agent however is that hell s threshold is in the apartment and when crossed the demon dethman is summoned to kill all those in his path the story is told by sam bishop a journalist who was accused of the murders although i am a champion of low budget microbudget and independent films i cannot praise this movie the creators take pride in their hour shooting schedule and at least one actor boasts on the dvd of his acting prowess but i cannot wrap my head around this why make a film in hours if an extra one or two hours of editing would make all the difference and why pride yourself on acting that is poor nonsensical and results in the bad delivery of a handful of lines through much of the film the models are being shown parts of an apartment by a real estate agent the dialog is clearly ad libbed because no scriptwriter could come up with such empty diction the agent also clearly knows nothing about housing she focuses on aspects of a home that no one could care about incorrectly explains the heat source didn t she see the radiator and says the vermin problem will be solved when they call the terminator please write a script some deviation is fine but this was a mess and why were the girls moving in models their careers had no point in the plot and this seems like a forced situation at one point an actress breaks character and says something to the effect of dude they re going to be upset which sounded more natural than any other line though out of place because of the other bad dialog the demon made no sense i appreciated the attempt to explain how hell s threshold jumps to random places on earth including apartment fireplaces but why not explain where the demon came from his background involves a man whose love is killed by another man how does this make you a demon also why did we need all these victorian flashbacks with no dialog and glances across a field it was overdone the dramatic pauses between lines was awful the sam bishop character was by far the worst with the interviewer not far behind does every question require a pause a funny face and a response followed by a pause a funny face and a response i was so frustrated to me the only point was to drag the time out but i d rather have thirty minutes of good delivery than an hour of horrible delivery and then more time is wasted by rolling through the same credits twice who was the sam bishop character anyway allegedly he saw all this and was accused of killing the girls but yet at no point was he ever in the part of the tale with the girls so how did he see them and if he didn t how did he know dethman killed them and if he didn t see dethman how does he know dethman is the spirit of apostoles i was so lost was there even an outline for a plot when this was written the only part i found enjoyable in this movie was a scene with one of the models in the bathroom not that it was really important or anything but it was the only break from boredom i was given i wonder what director felix diaz was thinking his music is very good see the dvd behind the scenes for his impromptu playing but i wonder about his movie making skills although by far the best part of the dvd was the trailer for his superhero excelsior the trailer alone was better than this entire waste of time i am sorry i have to be so harsh i d like to think that this movie was a test of what can be done in hours or maybe just an experiment for fun and the idea was never to make a quality film but if superhero excelsior is any indication diaz can make quality so why did he choose to avoid that here perhaps the world will never know
is nothing else on tv are you really bored well then watch phat beach however don t rent it and definitely do not buy it that would be a big mistake i watched this on tv and found myself laughing at certain points i did not laugh long and i did not laugh hard however there were subtle jokes and comments i laughed at if you are looking for an extremely funny hood movie then watch friday if you are looking for a powerful emotional movie something that this movie tries at kind of watch something like hoop dreams or jason s lyric if you are lookin for some good black booty go watch a dominique simone porn flick because the nudity in this movie is nearly non existent however if you have nothing better to do and this is on cable go ahead and watch it you will be slightly amused out of
i was really disappointed in this movie those that voted this thing a have a screw lose the acting was ok kinda wooden and cardboard the ending was sorry i just didn t care for this at all no way could i recommend this mess
i am not weapon expert but even i can see difference between u s army riffles in wwi and wwii in movie we can see privates armed with m garand invented in year not authentic springfield aka silent death who privates use until wwii difference m can load times more ammunition and times more fire rate m was semi automatic springfield requires reloading after every shot little difference german army uniforms has borrowed from year too especially helmets german helmets until end of wwi have significant pike on top we cannot see even one in movie and if we make little additional search in archives how much truthful is this true story i am surprised how much truthful can be film directors in a pursuit of cheap propagation
ok but does that make this a good movie well not really in my opinion there isn t a whole lot to recommend it i found it very slow tediously in fact it s also predictable pretty much through and through number one and two were somewhat predictable but not as much i also felt this movie was quite campy at times which i didn t really think fits this series and the character jeff fahey plays the main bad guy in this installment he s a decent enough actor but i felt he played his character too over the top i guess that fit with the tone of the movie which would have been great if i had liked the movie plus there were some pretty bad one liners arnold vosloo returns in the title role but is given little to work with in this movie the character has not really evolved as i had hoped oh well this is just my opinion anyway for me while this movie is not abysmal it is pretty bad my vote for darkman iii
i really must have caught a different film from the rest of the commentators on this site because at a screening of the film last night the audience was so mortified by the dialoge that i m not even kidding half walked out shot as if the filmmaker thought he were approaching some daring new territory by presenting a homosexual coming of age story the film utilizes david lynch inspired visuals with fassbinder inspired acting the performances in this film are so dull and bored that i figured one of the actors was going to pass out by how uninspired they seemed to be by the script what s worse is that it s colored like an episode of miami vice i don t know who this director thinks he is maybe he has pretensions of the surreal like bunuel jordowsky etc but the problem is that all of the afore mentioned directors display a level of erudite sensibility that is sorely lacking here i could understand the meaningfulness of this film about ten years ago but when we ve got masterpieces such as bad eduction mysterious skin and show me love why bother with this cinematic turd there is nothing new to be seen here
this film is really only bill maher s interpretation of religion there are several funny moments and some interesting points but don t go into this expecting an even handed discussion of religion this is what i consider to be the worst kind of documentary everything is arranged ahead of time and in editing to provide you with the opinion of the director rather than letting you make your own decision editing it s very chopped up inter spliced with clips from pop culture and the media to reinforce the point the interviewee barely has a chance to finish a sentence before he is interrupted by the editing the only people given a fair chance to speak their mind are those who say what bill maher wants them to say once someone deviates from the gospel according to maher they get edited interviewees they are meant to represent the absolute most extremist religions from the tv evangelical to the ultimate jewish stereotype to a truck stop chapel seriously a truck stop chapel he s picked the worst money grabbers the heavy extremists and those who don t have the budget to say no to pick on and when he does get a good person to interview he edits the hell out of them stereotyping all religions are portrayed as stereotypes especially hard hit are the muslims during the muslim segment he barely gives anyone the chance to speak before interrupting them either himself or through editing in pieces with suicide bombers all muslims are portrayed as gun toting extremists through the editing and none of the people interviewed is edited fairly ending the message at the end is incredibly heavy handed and while it is an interesting idea it s not presented with fairness to the countless people who are not religious extremists bill maher explains himself while clips of destruction play in the foreground this literally gives the message that religion is stupid and dangerous and that it will destroy the world he also states that everyone involved in religion is stupid with the faults to the film it has some good points and the humor while very unfair is actually funny but know going in it is a very one sided view bill maher s view of religion he s not discovering anything he s telling you what he thinks some good moments but heavy handed with an extremely irresponsible documentary style
well i must say this is probably the worst film i have seen this year the jokes were extremely crude wasn t expecting it from as pg movie rated pg in canada and they weren t funny with this great cast i at least expected some good acting but i didn t even get that i am a huge rainn wilson fan and this is the first time i was extremely disappointed by his performance neither luke wilosn or uma thurman s characters are the least bit likable and i really could have cared less what happened to either of them i didn t expect this at all as in the past i have really liked other movies by this director six days seven nights for example this movie was not worth the it cost me and i strongly encourage you not to see this movie i guarantee that you will be like me begging for this movie to be over
as a girl hinako moved away from her small village to tokyo leaving behind her two best friends fumiya and sayori she returns as a young woman surprised to find that sayori died when she was a teenager she reunites with fumiya and they are horrified to learn that sayori is mysteriously being resurrected via the island of shikoku oh boy i rented this because i like asian horror and i think chiaki kuriyama a nifty actress unfortunately if i had to describe shikoku in one word it would be fruity this movie is silly boring poorly filmed unimaginative and most of all unscary kuriyama has minimal screen time as the resurrected sayori and her character is given little to work with
i ve seen this movie today for the first time and i never heard of it before probably because of it s poor message first of all the directing itself is quite good the actors played well and the cgi i m not a fan of cgi is magnificent but that alone doesn t make a movie no story at all no message behind beautiful exploited talents or do i have to make people remember the art of a director is not only your vision but to know how to tell a story and this is what s missing the whole minutes there for a simple rating
i was able to hang in for only the first twenty minutes of this low budget movie the most glaring absurdity was that while the american inmates in a north korean pow camp are all supposedly suffering from severe deprivation of food and medicine going without bathing shivering in flimsy and filthy parkas and sleeping on bare floors and let s not forget enduring torture they always manage to sport impeccably coiffed hair with the exception of a suitably austere looking harry morgan as an army major the casting and acting are simply awful ronald regan cannot seem to stick to portraying a single character and instead creates a rather schizophrenic amalgam of past roles a mostly caucasian cast portraying the north korean camp officers might have been forgivable but when supposedly russian officers acting as advisors to the koreans strut around wearing re badged nazi uniforms complete with jodhpurs and jackboots obvious costume department recycles from wwii flicks and speaking with accents like general burkhalter from hogan s heroes well that s just six kinds of silly don t waste your time on this one
ever since the cinema loving universe made acquaintance with a guy named george a romero the word zombie automatically gets associated with blood soaked horror images and non stop acting sequences it s safe to say that his night of the living dead formed the zombie movie as we know it now yet in the earliest years of cinema the premise of reanimated corpses was merely used in slow nearly action less psychological thrillers jacques tourneur s i walked with a zombie is a perfect example and so is white zombie starring bela lugosi this revolt of the zombies could have been another example but unfortunately it s a failure over the entire line and easily one of the most tedious movies i ever saw dreadful acting a very poorly written screenplay and a complete lack of atmosphere and tension the film only lasts minutes and yet the first half hour is entirely wasted on stupid love story intrigues and unexciting monologues the setting in the legendary cambodian city of angkor surely could have resulted in a more compelling story but all we ever see are interior shots the lead actress dorothy stone textbook blonde with curly hair and an ugly nose irritated me enormously and i kept hoping a ravenous undead would suddenly appear out of nowhere to devour her unlucky again if you manage to struggle yourself through soporific minutes you ll be rewarded with a fairly decent finale still this is far too little to give this film a positive rating let alone a recommendation avoid this is the type of movie you should only see in case you already saw everything else
an older man touches a flower in his wife s greenhouse that seems to be wilting he gets pricked by it or bitten by something on it he quickly becomes ill and at the hospital spits out a large writhing white larva of some kind a later attempt to resuscitate him with paddles results in a splatter of blood a cop is at the hospital because his partner got badly hurt in a shoot out somehow the cop gets paired up with one of the female doctors as well as an entomologist who is brought in there are several young kids wandering around the hospital who i suppose we re supposed to find adorable but who are extremely annoying little brats they happen to wander into the room where the specimen is being kept and happen to dump a growth hormone on it horror movie logic would say they deserve to die for this but they re never even in any danger the critter grows and starts breeding people run away from it and sometimes towards it for some reason the hospital gets surrounded by military who are prepared to destroy everything if need be there are no really compelling characters in the movie and most of the time it seems like people are searching around for the monster it was fairly boring clearly it owes something to the alien movies with the monster being born inside a human and having several stages of its growth there s also a character named bishop and the lead actress has sigourney weaver s hair
after reading all of the rave reviews about this film and a few that give it a so so i finally decided to throw in my no cents worth i agree with most on the point that if it hadn t been for lauren lewis and chris ferry it would have been a disaster filmed in mariette oh just north of dogpatch where all the real talent fled south down i years ago at least as far as a tank of gas would allow i did get a chuckle from reviewers who subtly claim that they cerebrate a little better than most by claiming they followed the plot without an inkling of confusion this wee tale by the brothers crook is like an old record with a skip in it as an american i understand the difficulties ind film artists have to face a trip to romania would have wiped out the budget for sure lets face it this whole film was a loop de loop of claire in the gas station claire on the side of the road claire under the bleachers claire in the house claire in the cornfield claire at school claire here and claire there it almost became monotonous and would have if she had not been the best actor in the cast josh and jeff have to make a living but don t write a two page script and turn it into an hour twenty flick before writing another screenplay about dreaming ghosts watch an episode or two of ghost whisperer or something and get a little background all of the cast except the above mentioned and a couple of others were engaged in their first and last film also there is an appearance by co director jeff as he is in all his films just like alfred hitchcock eh one thing the film had going for it is that the cameraman seemed to have a fixation on lauren lewis derri re well with all sarcasm now satisfied i still recommend the film for the horror buff just to see this young actress in the formative time of her career i hope and that chris ferry has established himself as a villain worth watching
this is the kind of movie that wants to be good but sucks first thing what the hell are those punk trying to do with the school i think the kids doesn t seem to realize the gravity of the situation deker guy say to the girl that they under his responsibility when she ask why he wants to go back for them but right after this he gives a gun to the wheel chair dude and wants him to go alone repair the phone line where is the responsibility there i understand poor actors must pay their food but why not just give them the money that takes to make a stupid movie like that or give that money to a charity oh yea and none of them knows how to aim the stupid punk guy shoots in the cafeteria nowhere like a crazy they all want to look professional but they all suck one more thing i don t believe that there s no emergency exit in the school the kids are trying several doors but they all locked what happens if there s a fire and the dumass security guard is dead it is illegal to not have an emergency exit in school anyway there s a lot more to say but it would be too long i spent some time of my life to watch a crap
this movie was horrible i could barely stay awake through it i would never see this movie again if i were payed to the so called horror scenes in it were increadably predictable and over played there was really nothing about this movie that would have made it original or worth the i payed to see it don t go see it don t rent it don t read about it online because any of these things would be a complete waste of your time sarah michelle geller gave a lackluster performance and really should be ashamed of herself for sullying her good name with this movie shame on you sarah for being associated with this horrible horrible movie horrible movie no need to ever see it
hi folksforget about that movie john c should be ashamed that he appears as executive producer in the credits bon jovi has never been and will never be an actor and the fx are a joke the first vampires was good and it was the only vampires this thing here just wears the same name just a waste of time thinks jake scorpio
i was supposed to review this for a website and i watched this with optimism that perhaps it would at least be a cheesy yet entertaining rip off and it didn t even do that well enough the child is probably one of the worst supernatural thrillers i ve ever seen even worse than godsend with scenes that rip from the omen without shame the ending is even very similar to the way the omen ends not to mention that the acting writing and story are all just hackneyed if these movies make money i m sad to see where asylum is headed it s embarrassing
i anticipated the release of the film as much as any fan of the broadway play i waited and read reviews for months about the award winning performances i mean with the star power of eddie murphy jamie foxx beyonce knowles danny glover the movie couldn t be less than out of stars right wrong i was definitely disappointed by the finished product the film did not match up to the publicity hype it was given and the only saving graces were eddie murphy anika noni rose and jennifer hudson eddie murphy s james brownesque performance rescues the movie just when it hits its multiple lulls and jennifer hudson s performance compels you to pay attention each time she s on screen her performance of and i am telling you was the only time that i felt the hype was deserved you cringed as she begged her no good man to let her stay in the group and in his life as many reviewers have stated she steals the movie from the more experienced actors and deserves all the accolades she s receiving for this performance anika noni rose was also a strong presence with a great voice and comedic talent jamie foxx and beyonce knowles on the other hand cruised through their performances foxx s acting skills for this film seemed to predate his extraordinary ray performance and beyonce knowles was on an extended fashion photo shoot or video taping posing and shimmying her way through the movie her performance wasn t strong enough to make you care about her character at any point in the film the movie was too hyped minutes and song beyonce s heartfelt solo to jamie foxx too long dh vancouver wa
i know that some films i mean european films that are very bad films are being regarded as great cinema by certain critics only because they re non american i saw the imdb score for this film and noticed the fact that this was being selected for certain big festivals don t let this fool you unless you re one of those people that likes mind numbing films like this and call it great art afterwards skip it the film contains one hilarious scene after another a similar italian film popped into my mind the terrible preferisco il rumore del mare i prefer the sound of the sea the problem with these films is that they re not only boring like some other strangely praised films but that they almost play like camp i mean let s face it the acting is horrible i mean soap opera level the story has not one surprise this has been done endless times before connecting several storylines short cuts magnolia playing by heart only much better not one realistic character in it some true freak seeing along the way notice the hilarious zombie like daughter and so on and so on as if that s not enough the film is min count it long and at the end the director opens his can of sentimentality after a film with such hilariously bad dialogue and scenes that made the public at the preview screening laugh at so much incompetence well this is an insult to cinema and only receives high ratings because it happens to be in another language in this case spanish strange world we live in
the story of a woman ann on her death bed her two daughters nina and constance and her thoughts about her past the flashbacks are concerning a weekend where young ann is in the wedding of her friend lila at the wedding she meets harris who will impact her for the rest of her life through all the ups and downs of her professional and family life she remembers him as her true love her daughter constance is older more responsible a mother of two and has things together nina jumps from boyfriend to boyfriend and job to job and is unsure of her direction in life first of all the good the period detail in the movie is great the dresses hair cars houses etc really put you in another time and place and there is some very quality acting in the movie vanessa redgrave is quite good at portraying the main character and her fragile mental state as her life comes to an end claire danes is beautiful and does a great job as the main character when she was young and she is an outstanding singer hugh dancy brought a lot of life to the character of lila s brother buddy now for the bad which unfortunately is everything else things constantly disrupt the story as it is being unfolded for us the chemistry between young ann and buddy is great they have fun and dance then you are supposed to believe that she doesn t really like him more than a friend and that his pining only annoys her and i thought the whole he might be gay thing was out of the blue and didn t serve a purpose then we have harris the character acts wooden and creepy had this been another genre you would have known that harris was the serial killer from the get go it is an unbelievable stretch to think that all these girls loved him so but they do portray the other guys as pretty lame to try and help him out and the grandest problem of all why don t ann and harris get together they fall for each other they have this great night of sex in an old dirty gardener s shack come home to find out about buddy s tragic end and then nothing they meet up a few years later and get all misty eyed about each other and i couldn t help but wondering why why the movie doesn t let you know why they were forced to marry other people and so i had a hard time feeling sorry for them the part of the story in the present is fairly boring the clich good daughter and the clich bad daughter nina changes over the course of the movie but i am not sure why i m not sure what convinces her to change her life there is a touching scene where the daughters are connecting that coincides with old ann dreaming she s chasing a butterfly it is really lame and embarrassing there are no mistakes ann advises at us the statement doesn t ring true with the story and it doesn t ring true after seeing the movie and wishing they hadn t wasted the talent of such good actors
i totally hated the movie it was so retarded they need to get some acting lessons no wait that won t help because the naked brothers band people a retards you know why i am here even though i am a naked brothers band hater to warn people before they watch the dumb movie so that the nbb doesn t get any money from it so then they can t make any more amateur stupid songs that are so retarded that any old guy could go and write it in seconds not only are the song lyrics retarded they sing badly okay i m kinda getting off the movie here anyways it was boring and they acted horribly it was not funny at all even though they tried really hard for it to be i guess they deserve some credit for that well the movie isn t worth your time just look at its rating the movie and the series is very painful to watch for anyone who has even half a brain seriously if you liked it you need to go watch movies where the actors actually act not babbling their lines in a monotone i am on the drama club at my school and some people there are actually better than those nat and alex guys hurry before it s too late i seriously thought that herbie fully loaded was better than this piece of poopie i don t even know why i went through even half of that film i don t think it even deserves to be called a film
a killer cannibal rapist is killed by a crazed cop on the scene of his latest murder at his grave a cult have gathered with plans to resurrect him by peeing onto the grave this of course works and he awakes ripping the guys penis off and he is back into his old killing ways with an all new zombie look the two cops one of who is going a little crazy about the scum of the city and has a drug problem are back on the case two of the original cult member also tries to stop the killer by resurrecting some other kind of dead thing thinking they have filed they leave but out from the grave comes a plastic baby doll that was used in the original resurrection sounds a bit confusing really but no its just rubbish the acting is terrible and one of the cops is the same guy that plays dr vincent van gore in the faces of gore series and he is just as terrible as the annoying cop in this film the other cop just about struggles to get his terrible lines out now i m all for low budget cinema but this film is just terrible if it wasn t for the very easy on the eye ladies and their nakedness i would probably have fallen asleep there is a bit of gore but it s never more than some animal guts placed on the stomach of the victims the zombie makeup on the other hand looks great and his foot long penis that he uses to rape his victims with is kind of funny at times there is also a half decent scene where the killer falls in love with a sex doll the doll with the chipmunks voice is the stupidest thing i have ever seen in a film it is just a plastic toy on a fishing line the ending is extremely bad you would expect the killer to put up much more of a fight than he does god knows how they made enough money to make a sequel
i got this movie out of blockbuster in one of those racks were you can get like movies for bucks i d have to say i got my money s worth on this one i had expected horrible dialogue crappy monsters and shaky cameras well as meatloaf said two outta three ain t bad the acting is bad though not as bad as some movies i ve seen or maybe i ve watched so many low budget movies recently i ve lost perspective there are some bits were the acting is downright terrible but for the most part it s of at least high school play level the cg for the sasquatch in this movie is probably the second worst part the first thing i thought when i saw it and i noticed another reviewer agreed with me was that a man in an ape suit would have been better clunky stop motion animation would have looked better so you may be asking why i call the cg the second worst part that s because the very worst part of the movie is the sound effects they are loud annoying and constant i ve been camping i know what insects sound like in the woods at night and while they can be loud they re not deafening like the cacophony in this movie usually when the background sounds drown out the movie s dialogue it s a bad thing but from what i caught of the dialogue of this film i wasn t missing much the action was infrequent and boring the tension was non existent as was any sense of empathy with the characters speaking of the characters they were all cookie cutter and bland the only mildly engaging byplay was between actually i can t think of anything there was a line or two that made me crack a wan smile but that was about it the cinematography was decent a step or two above what you d normally see in a movie like this however it still had that home movie quality to it that you get with movies made on pocket change and a prayer if you re like me and get a kick out of shoestring budget genre flicks and you see this one in the dollar bin think about grabbing it otherwise stay away at all costs
i rented this tape a couple of years ago and boy did it suck from the commercials i was lead to believe that this was a movie about a guy who had no no luck with women and that was where the comedy would lie boy was i wrong the jokes were vulgar and they were just not funny don t bother
starts really well nice intro and build up for the main characters but after about minutes the charm is lost the character is in the same mould as the main protagonist from american pie and loser without the supporting cast or innovative storyline that made the pie movies more of a commercial success let s be honest heder s acting was pretty poor keaton daniels and faris did their best but had no substantial plot or script to get their teeth into the movie just plods on without any pace or clear logical storyline justifying its length the ending is about as predictable as they come so predictable i ve ticked the spoilers box for this one line my advice avoid at all costs unless you really really have nothing else to do listen to or watch and even then you ll feel the producers just cheated you out of an hour and a half of your life
first of all i d like to tell you that i m into comics anime animation and such stuff it is true that everyone has his own preferences but you can trust me on this movie i ll be objective to begin with the story it s ok follows the story line of the comic books as far as i m familiar with them but the animation well it s not actually terrible but it s definitely cheap and mediocre it would be a lot better if they didn t try to imitate the anime style and sticked to the original comic book style drawings if we pretend not to see the rare sloppy effects like fire and lightnings you could tell that the movie is made about years ago and even more looks a little bit like the original vampire hunter d from take a look at heavy metal fakk for instance years ago they made a movie that looks a hell lot better in addition to this the voice talents do nothing remarkable the music is nothing special so all in all it lacks atmosphere i watched it but i cannot tell i really enjoyed it it just does not capture you there s plenty of blood and violence but that does not impress me at all may be it will be shocking for someone who was never watched more mature oriented animations and sees animated blood for the first time is there anyone around but i don t think this is the audience for this movie so they could add a little nudity and spice to it the chicks around lucifer were quite tasty and hell we have lady death herself there are few sexy looks but that s not enough instead of bill brown s music i think it would look better on a hard rock heavy metal soundtrack all in all the movie isn t that bad but if you want something better take the original heavy metal heavy metal fakk ralph bakshi s fire and ice or wizards maybe and of course vampire hunter d bloodlust
i ve seen about four other japanese horror films and they weren t too impressive however i could sense that there was a sensible script guiding the way not here no way this is about a detective who is trying to tie together similar murders that have been happening when he finds a suspect to question the suspect freaks out because they keep seeing a ghost then the ghost starts to follow the detective around for a reason that is never explained and takes up more than half of the movie bad enough oh no the film keeps switching perspectives to different characters who don t have much to do with the story i ve seen this before in other movies where it shows a different perspective not the case here also whatever is happening on screen that is actually tolerable quickly ends for example there a few scenes with a slight instrumental score that builds up and then it just cuts to another scene i m aware that this can be a dramatic effect that s definitely not the intention here it s just bad editing finally there s the ghost who just screams in a way that s not scary or unintentionally funny it s annoying and it happens a lot throughout the movie all of the scares have been done before in better ways so you can see them all coming then after one of them the movie is over at that point a wave of confusion swept over the audience as i could sense we all felt that we had wasted our time someone did a mock clap and laughter ensued it was better than the whole film simply put avoid
i always get frustrated by films that were obviously written by one gender especially when they obviously don t do enough research to find out when something not only doesn t ring true but rings blatently false the scene i am remembering is the one in the bathroom where jack tells his football teammates that he got diane pregnant in no way shape or form would a guy ever cheer another guy getting a girl pregnant in high school they might cheer about the guy having sex with the hot cheerleader but i can also guarantee that the first the football team heard about it would not be at a urinal it was obvious that this film didn t take itself so seriously and it wasn t hideously bad but come on
this is a thriller with a good concept good acting good photography and good intentions all around but which is confused and disjointed in execution garcia stars as john berlin an l a forensic detective who has moved to a small california town at the behest of a friend of his on the force there he soon becomes involved in the investigation of an unsolved murder which leads to his theorizing about the existence of a serial killer whom no one else believes in the known victim is theorized to be blind which leads to a romance with a blind girl believed to be a witness at a nearby school for the blind despite a basically intriguing story there were too many quantum leaps and plot holes in this movie where i found myself wondering how the hell did we wind up here or how did we find this out i found it confusing and disjointed despite the good acting etc john malkovich has a small part toward the end as an f b i investigator out to get berlin not recommended
no one is a greater fan of geroge macdonald fraser s flashman papers than i am i was surprised to see just now that richard lester directed royal flash since i also see he had made the three four musketeers with fraser which i though turned out rather well not so royal flash i was years old when the film was released and could not have been more enthusiastic since i had read all the flashman papers published up to that time and was intoxicated with a clockwork orange and malcolm macdowel i still am but he was never really given a chance after that what a disappointment i saw it once again when i was about on television and it seemed even worse none of the sharp dialogue in the books is transfered to the screen the comedy of flashman s character seemed to me to have been mishandled in about the same way one could imagine a group of high school students trying to parody it would do the dueling and fencing was awful and undramatic looking back with more mature eyes the film failed completer to exploit the possibilities of direct satire of earlier film versions of the prisoner of zenda if you have read the book and not seen the film i can only say that the film ends with flashman and rudi von starnberg becoming fast friends and playing a game rudi has just invented russian roulette a pathetic betrayal of everything the books are about my comments would be more direct if i had seen the film more recently but i am glad i have not if by any chance fraser ever reads this i can only say i think he is a genius perhaps the greatest comic novelist of his generation but based on my appreciation of that corpus of work it as hard to believe that he wrote the screenplay of this film as that he did all those awful roger moore james bond films
this film takes what could have been a good idea a mummified year old witch and completely destroys it nora and jim are alcoholics who go to ireland to dry out they go to stay with her nan and uncle the uncle has discovered a year old witch preserved in the peat he revives her and she takes the form of nora she cannot be killed conventionally more is the pity nora however works out a way to do so this is a gothic horror movie that has been done on the cheap it is a sprawling mess i have to ask why anyone would want to make such a bad film i am tempted to learn witchcraft in order to make it disappear avoid at all costs
this is available on a drive in double feature from dark sky films and since i just had finished up barracuda i watched this too this is a film that proves to be incredibly ambitious and inept at the same time we begin with two young ladies wandering the streets of some foreign town but where exactly are they they stop to look at necklaces from some chinese vendor and try on chinese style clothes at a shop but then we see some aztec dancers and all the while these girls are being followed by two guys who eventually drop whatever stealth they didn t have to chase the girls on a wild run though the town and they finally catch them it seems that one of the girls has a coin on a string around her neck and these guys want to find the loot and where did she get it so in flashback we go back to find out and how did they know she had this coin hard to say really now back in the day when these two women were years old they were out with their sisters and their sister s boyfriends on a boat and after stopped to get air in their tanks they tow this young boy back to his home dock only to have his grandpa come out invite the young uns up for herbal tea with granny but not everyone has the tea todd has gone back to the boat to check on the young girls and then when they re away from it the boat blows up and when they get back to the house their friends have mysteriously disappeared well it seems as though these kindly folk raise their own vegetables but they wait for the meat to drop by for a spell and serve it herbal tea but the girls and todd did leave the island but now they re returning escorted by their captors and they re there to find the treasure despite the fact that no one ever showed the girls where it was before there also seems to be someone else on the island and the thugs mysteriously begin to die one by one and since there s only three it doesn t take long and there s even a sort of happy ending which will leave the viewer every bit as baffled as they were throughout the rest of the film the two thugs seem to be speed freaks with anger issues and combined with no acting ability they re borderline hilarious the hillbilly type family is also devoid of acting ability despite the fact that the grandpa is hank worden who appeared in many films and tv shows the action is confusing the locales are even more confusing and the island looks like southern california so what the hell is this i m not sure but it certainly is worth seeing once so you can think or say huh out of very bizarre
it s funny when you stop and think about it fright film fans tend to a deep and abiding affection toward those who scare the daylights out of them the texas chainsaw massacre may give us nightmares but who among us the faithful didn t feel a very real twinge of love for gunnar hansen in brutal massacre or for ken foree forever and ever the resolute hero of the original dawn of the dead his cameo in the remake made me want to stand up and cheer as did tom savini s cameo i kid you not and brian halloran and well you get my drift if not just stand downwind these are some of the heroes of horror to see this many of them gathered together in a single movie is almost unheard of at least to this degree to my knowledge if only the writer s had been up to such a monumental task maybe someone else somewhere along the line will try again as long as it s not another half hearted effort like brotherhood of blood for instance
is miike like chabrol alternating art with dreck sometimes confusing the two does he match the fifty fifty rate some claim for chabrol do we see here too much or too little miike i don t know i don t know i don t know but i could easily fill ten lines just citing chakushin ari s one missed call s steals allusions and clich s others here will hit on most of them though not perhaps ochiai s saimin hypnosis for the sleazy telecast taunting things supernatural only once when yumi takes the zombie like mother in her arms did one missed call startle me a little one other point of interest renji ishibashi looks like christopher walken as the detective ishibashi in audition s abusive back story and as dead or alive s boss aoki of the vat of excrement drowning and more may be the most convincingly evil character actor i ve ever seen so here he s a cop
how viewers react to this new adaption of shirley jackson s book which was promoted as not being a remake of the original movie true enough will be based i suspect on the following those who were big fans of either the book or original movie are not going to think much of this one and those who have never been exposed to either and who are big fans of hollywood s current trend towards special effects being the first and last word in how good a film is are going to love it things i did not like about this adaption it was not a true adaption of the book from the articles i had read this movie was supposed to cover other aspects in the book that the first one never got around to and that seemed reasonable no film can cover a book word for word unless it is the length of the stand and not even then but there were things in this movie that were never by any means ever mentioned or even hinted at in the movie reminded me of the way they decided to kill off the black man in the original movie version of the shining i didn t like that either what the movie s press release should have said is we got the basic very basic idea from shirley jackson s book we kept the same names of the house and several though not all of the leading character s names but then we decided to write our own story and what the heck we watched the changeling and the shining and ghost first and decided to throw in a bit of them too they completely lost the theme of a parapyschologist inviting carefully picked guest who had all had brushes with the paranormal in their pasts to investigate a house that truly seemed to have been born bad no instead this doctor got everyone to the house under the false pretense of studying their insomnia he really invited them there to scare them to death and then see how they reacted to their fear like lab rats who he mentioned never got told they are part of an experiment nice guy this doctor who did not have the same name by the way was as different from the dedicated professional of the original movie as night from day in direct contrast to the statement that was used to promote both movies some houses are just born bad this house was not born bad but rather became bad because of what happened there and this time around nel gets to unravel the mystery shades of the changeling the only problem was the so called mystery was so incoherently told that i m sure it remained a mystery to most of the audience but then there was no mystery in the first place not in the book because the house was bad to begin with it s first victim died before ever setting eyes on it the way the character of luke was portrayed was absolutely ridiculous he was supposed to be a debonair playboy who was someday to inherit the house and was a true skeptic of it s history and in this one he was just a winey voiced bumbling nerd who couldn t sleep insomnia remember and was a compulsive liar i was also annoyed with the way the movie jumped from almost trying to recreate original scenes word for word the scene with nel s sister s family and mrs dudley s little opening speech to going off into flights of fancy that made me think more of these other movies than the haunting it s like it couldn t make up its mind what it wanted to do i missed nel s narrative through the whole movie the original was so like a gothic novel in the way that the story was mostly told in the first person through nel s eyes and we always were privy to her thoughts that totally unique touch was completely lost in the new version they also tried to make nel much more of a heroine the original nel was not a bad person but she was a bitter person could she be otherwise after sacrificing years of her life to a selfish old woman and a spiteful sister and she liked to moan and she lost her temper this one was almost too good to be true this was never more apparent than in the climax of the movie where the writer s had obviously been watching ghost one too many times they changed the history of the house and it s occupents too much there was no abigail crain the daughter of hugh whose legend loomed large in the original versions there was no companion and there was no nursery there was also no grace wife of the original doctor and hugh crain s wives died in totally different ways these changes changed the story way too much i don t know whether the producers of this movie should be glad shirley jackson no longer walks this earth or whether they should be sorry if ya get my drift the hauntings she could envision are not something to be trifled with in conclusion let me just leave you with some words from the original luke appropriate substitution of the word house for movie this movie should be burnt to the ground and the ground sprinkled with salt my favorite movie of all time remains so no competition from this one
after being bitten by a bat in a cave a doctor named john beck undergoes an accelerating transformation into a man bat creature his wife assures him that there s nothing wrong with him it s all just due to rabies or the anti rabies drugs he s taking the local cop thinks that john is responsible for several gruesome murders the bat people by jerry jameson is one hell of a horrible film the script is deadly dull and there is no gore nor nudity this pointless piece of crap is so mind numbingly boring that you ll scratch your head in a total disbelief after suffering through it even the design of a man bat creature by a young stan winston is completely pathetic and unmemorable avoid this stinker like the plague out of
a friend told me of john fante last summer after we got into a conversation about charles bukowski i did not know that fante was a favorite writer of bukowski s an author with similar edge and humor except from one generation earlier ask the dust was the first fante book i read and it remains one of my favorite novels the novel was a brilliant piece of writing about a sad frightened young writer posing to himself and the outside world as an overconfident masterfully talented author who had no idea how to write about the real world experiences he had none of in the novel the protagonist is a virgin with no idea how to win the graces of the women he desperately wants to write about in magazines the story of his bizarre relationship with camilla how he settles for his first sexual experience with a wounded admirer and how he eventually is left with nothing but the story of his failed attempts at love is biting and real with no touching hollywood ending the film adaptation stays true to the book for a while but meanders into the cinematic trap of love persevering through racism sickness and death the heart of this story lies in the fact that bandini is a jerk and camilla is f ing crazy and their love never was and never would be the real thing no matter how much either of them wanted to find it in each other this movie tore out the real meaning of the story out and replaced it with schlock i can t believe the man who wrote chinatown could read this book and make a movie about it that got it so wrong
what s in here let me tell you it s the presence of alec baldwin he s not a great actor but maybe a nice star with some good movies which this is not one of them he did nothing here more than anything he did before or after so not to mention literally the matter of steve mcqueen being at the same role in the original because i don t want to make that comparison in the first place i m not a big fan or even a fan of kim basinger she got a lot of bad movies on her and even at her best she looks average and it gets on my nerve indeed whenever they talk about her seductive rare beauty well if being a blond would make anyone captivating then i ll dye my hair in yellow as soon as possible and what is it with all the craziness over miss basinger s legs it s surely insanity or bad tasting as i don t see them both as not sexy only but ugly too and if you hate that so shoot me down but you know what i ve just watched this movie so i m dead already yet what would make you really suffer in unbearable way is that nothing of the credits goes to the one she deserves the most and of course i mean jennifer tilly now we re talking about a true genuine seductive chick with such unforgettable body and one unique sense of allurement like a nasty brunette marilyn monroe however much more healthier i can t help it she was the only new and watchable thing in here michael madsen as the bad guy was much appealing as well as effective more than the good guys james woods is here to summarize the early events beside the pool so the trailer would be by his voice later and he knew before all that this is a whole hollywood s stuff so do your thing take your cash and good luck as an actor in other movies the editing gave the movie a serious personality along with violent atmosphere done by suitable shining cinematography so the main goods of it the action the thrill are here and fairly well made though any echo for deep meanings about the kinds of betrayal as the main dramatic motif of the whole thing is not that strong so don t wait for it ok it s all in all another remake without anything special except jennifer tilly s spicy moments so i think i tried to be objective as much as i could therefore i shouldn t end my review saying that basinger or anyone here did better than this movie it would be an insult because frankly anything is better than this movie
i saw this recent woody allen film because i m a fan of his work and i make it a point to try to see everything he does though the reviews of this film led me to expect a disappointing effort they were right this is a confused movie that can t decide whether it wants to be a comedy a romantic fantasy or a drama about female mid life crisis it fails at all three alice mia farrow is a restless middle aged woman who has married into great wealth and leads a life of aimless luxury with her rather boring husband and their two small children this rather mundane plot concept is livened up with such implausibilities as an old chinese folk healer who makes her invisible with some magic herbs and the ghost of a former lover with whom she flies over manhattan if these additions sound too fantastic for you how about something more prosaic like an affair with a saxophone player i was never quite sure of what this mixed up muddle was trying to say there are only a handful of truly funny moments in the film and the endingis a really preposterous touch of pollyanna rent crimes and misdemeanors instead a superbly well done film that suceeds in combining comedy with a serious consideration of ethics and morals or go back to annie hall or manhattan
evil breed is a very strange slasher flick that is unfortunately no good the beginning of the film seems promising but overall it s a disaster the dialogue is pretty bad but not near as bad as the acting the acting is brutal and unbearable most of the characters deliver there lines horribly and even if that is on purpose the method doesn t work because the characters become annoying some of the kills are innovative but it took far too long to get to them after about a half hour through the movie we get the first death other than in the beginning and then almost every other character is smoked within the next five minutes the movie then turned into sort of a spoof with ridiculous looking characters unrealistic karate like fights and a scene in which a man gets his intestines pulled out of his a sscrack none of it is funny it s just plain ridiculous the film then becomes ultra gory and ultra pointless most of the characters are clich d even for slasher standards and are as solid as butter left on the counter for days evil breed isn t even laughably bad therefore it fails in it s main task watch texas chainsaw massacre just before dawn or see no evil for a real slasher
i couldn t give this film a bad rating or bad review for two reasons robin williams and toni collete the film has the potential of being a thriller and there are some slight disturbing elements that lean to the psychological which was something the film could have focused a little on robin williams plays gabriel noon a storytelling night time deejay who is going through personal issues his lover moves out and gabriel is having what seems to be a case of storyteller s block one day he receives and reads a story written by a dying year old boy named pete boland rory culkin pete tells the story of his life and the abuse he suffered at the hands of his parents he lives with his adopted mother and social worker donna boland toni collette gabriel is fascinated and begins a friendship with pete but things seem strange when gabriel attempts to meet him and discovers the possibility that pete boland may not even exist i won t go into detail because i don t want to spoil the film but i will tell you this it is quite predictable fascinating atmosphere for telling a story and good performances from robin williams and toni collette who i thought was the film s key character collette is without question one of the most talented and loveliest actresses her ability to tap into the psyche and personality of the characters she portrays is very uncanny and i hope to see her win an oscar hell i think she might pull off getting a best supporting actress nod for this one if the script were a little better the film starts off as a psychological thriller but a predictable one at that if your curious to know the film s ending and twists then see the film otherwise i would rent another predictable thriller called hide and seek
i thought i read somewhere that this was the last monogram production but whether that s true or not it doesn t matter because if it wasn t then it should have been it s a deadly dull affair starring john carradine with some gray in his hair to make himself appear like an older scientist who is experimenting with the aid of his young apprentice robert shayne in bringing the dead back to life every time their subjects are revived they seem to have a whitish face like marble as they are lying strapped to the laboratory table big deal carradine manages to restore his faithful dog to life after it s dead and the mutt gains an unusual ability to walk through walls in a ghostlike fashion wooooooooohhhh that s about all she wrote for an ultra cheap monogram quickie this thing at least actually utilizes a more fancy schmancy lab setup than is usually allotted the funniest running joke in the movie is that the older doctor carradine constantly refers to his young assistant shayne as m boy when in fact carradine was actually and shayne was when they made this
did anyone read the script this has to be some of the worst writing and directing of the entire year three great actors paul giamatti rachel weisz and miranda richardson couldn t pull this one out about two thirds it looked like giamatti eyes were saying i can t believe i signed the contract it s not the worst movie i ever saw but it s on the really really bad christmas movie list not enough lines but what else can be said okay the movie just doesn t move with vaughn s con man dialogue his character is just a creepy guy that you just can t get past it was just a lackluster walk through that no one seemed to be able to get into
i just saw this film last night in the tribeca film festival and it seriously makes me wonder if the folks at the festival actually screen the films before selecting them the film was simply awful i say that without hyperbole or ulterior motives it was awful matthew modine s days as a leading man are way over gina gershon sported an inexplicable and unnecessary english accent she should be ashamed of her participation in this film gloria reuben had a weird little cameo in it she should also be ashamed the script was terrible and the we were given absolutely no reason to care about the characters i highly doubt this will be picked up but then again people in hollywood are known to make mistakes sometimes i really think kettle of fish is a serious contender for the worst movie i ve ever seen
the original trancers is not by any means a great movie it had massive plot holes and very little in the way of internal logic however it was entertaining better done than most low budget b movies and could be surprisingly witty unfortunately trancers ii is none of these trancers ii suffers from many of the same problems of most flop sequels the plot is thin enough to see through and the writing is insipid it seems that the people behind this movie felt that bringing the familiar faces of the first movie back would be enough and didn t bother with anything else not even veteran b grade actors like tim thomerson and jeffery combs were able to drag this film out of the muck a brief plot overview jack deth thomerson is a cop from the future who was sent to to save the ancestors of members of his government trancers ii takes place six years after the events of the first trancers jack deth is married to lena helen hunt the woman he met in the first movie and both live with hap ashby the man deth was sent into the past to protect it is discovered that the brother of whistler the bad guy from the first movie has traveled back in time to create an army of trancers people turned into mindless killing zombies to kill ashby complicating jack s mission is the fact that his first wife who had died long before jack traveled to the past was also sent back to stop whistler s brother and now jack finds himself working with her i have two real problems with this movie one is that the method of creating trancers in this movie is radically different from the methods used in the first movie what makes it annoying is that in a rather poor example of soviet revisionism they act like it was always the technique the other thing that annoys me is that the love triangle between deth lena and alice stilwell jack s first wife is given very little screen time this bothered me particularly because it was much more interesting than the actual plot of the movie it felt like it was just something that was thrown in to fill space in the movie alice s character in particular seems very unconcerned with the fact that she is reunited with her husband only to find he s re married making her either very shallow or very poorly written the only reason i can think of for watching this movie is if you re interested in watching the entire trancers series currently totaling six movies otherwise even if you re a fan of the original trancers stay away from this tepid sequel
i think this is probably one of the worst movies i ve watched in a long time trying to get the same characters with different people is such a bad idea if they couldn t get sara michelle g and ryan p in this one they should have just cut their losses and said to heck with it instead they get new actors that are horrible at what they did i seriously felt like i was at a high school or bad college play with the lever of acting these people put forth where do they get some of these people was this their first movie it sure seemed like it this movie also parallels the original in a few lines of speech i had just got done watching the first one and popped in i was all excited to get to watch the second one and it ended up being the worst show i ve seen in a while i don t hardly ever ever turn off a movie but this one definitely went off after about min
what is the most harrowing movie ever made the gynaecological nightmare of cries and whispers the acid psychodramas of fassbinder the discomfiting black comedy of last house on the left i m sure for that portion of the film loving public that tie their masts to the good ship buster keaton there is only one answer any one of his sound films i don t know what flayed my soul more poignantly in this movie the grounding of keaton s intricate and expansive physical art to humdrum slapstick the painful hesitation of this master filmmaker with dialogue not that he hasn t a lovely comic voice or that he can t make dialogue funny it s just that the studio don t seem to have given him enough takes and so he seems to be trying to remember his lines before he delivers which only makes him keaton not his character look silly or is it the humiliation of seeing keaton caught up in a tawdry sex farce when he has given us some of the richest accounts of romantic frustration in film no i know what was most disturbing having to watch buster keaton cinema s greatest comedian sit aside to observe jimmy durante doing his schtick it is horrors such as this that get yer dantes composing yer infernos mgm seem to have got the curious idea that the best way to adapt keaton to sound was to turn him into a marx brother complete with verbal pedantry elaborate tedious clowning shambolic slapstick theatrical setting triumph through chaos and thelma todd keaton was just not that sort of comic and where groucho s malicious tongue and gleeful opportunism might just have made this plot work buster s socially inept professor can t he is too studied and predictable what buster needed was to be allowed experiment like lang in m or rene clair he would never have tried to hold back the tide like chaplin when a film like the general is alluded to messing about with trains the loss becomes even more apparent and the thing is in patches amid the flat direction the film isn t all that bad there is an excellent jolt when a camera on the bus leaves keaton alone at a railway station and the denouement if hardly original is at least livelier than what went before there is something almost endearing about the way keaton slows down a plot that needs all the zip it can get there is a film in here about loneliness emotionally paralysing order the numbing effects of education etc struggling to get out the best way to appreciate this film is to watch not the narrative of professor tz post but of emasculated genius buster keaton trapped in a prison of mediocrity confounded by new technology mocked by a malevolent fate in this case the studio retaining a stoical grace looked at like that it becomes a kind of masterpiece
what a wasted cast this is one of the most disappointing films i ve seen usually roger ebert does not let me down but i feel cheated after seeing this movie the only thrill is seeing elizabeth banks in her bra that is a sorry statement about this movie it held so much promise but it was like dry humping a transvestite this is self absorbed tripe i cannot express deeply enough my bitterness at having sat through this movie and hope i can forewarn you of the same disappointment
ok my girlfriend and i rented the dvd and about minutes into the movie we d exchanged a lot of ehhh what is this movie about and more importantly do i care to find out what it ends with glances and decided we either needed drugs to keep us interested in the plot or just end the pain right there and then and watch something else we opted for the latter i liked but i m a cheerleader a lot but mango kiss is too silly and surreal for my taste sorry i definitely prefer d e b s better than chocolate fucking m l goldfish memory and fire sorcia
from the opening dialog and scenes i knew i knew i was in for a train wreck didn t want to look but couldn t turn away if it weren t for the meer eye candy of this film i would have given one star the fact that the interaction between characters and relationship behavior were so far fetched added by poor direction and horrible story make this movie nothing more than a low budget disaster money is definitely not a necessity to make a good film but this movie fails so horribly there was no chance to rebound if you were stuck out in the woods your childhood best friend dying from an unknown disease other friends dying around you stranded in a strange place what would you do a run away from everyone and try your luck on your own b have sex with your friends girlfriend c take a hot bath to relax your sorrows to include shaving your legs d bash in the head your childhood best friend and life long crush with a shovel e all of the above according to eli roth none of these answers are that far fetched in fact all are plausible and well represented in cabin fever the total lack of reality and illogical attempt at explaining what people would do in traumatic situations throws this film in the bonehead bin at your local rental store stay away stay far away
one of the worst films i have ever had the displeasure of sitting through killer tongue is a horrible melange of the worst elements of the rocky horror picture show brain damage and pulp fiction designed primarily to offend apparently but so inane that only the most hidebound conservatives would be taken in by it
i don t think any player in hollywood history lasted as long as david niven did given most of the weak films he had to carry by dint of his incredible charm he could act got an oscar for it but most of the material he did was as light as one ply of two ply tissue paper happy go lovely is a case in point it s a musical and for the most part you ll remember vera ellen s dancing you ll remember that they are in scot s costume as the film is set in edinburgh during their festival but if you can recall a single song from it you must have a photographic memory the plot is light vera ellen is the american lead in a musical that apparently is getting its out of town tryout in edinburgh she starts in the chorus and runs late one day she gets a lift from the chauffeur of a millionaire greeting card king everybody now assumes she s the main squeeze of the millionaire doors open up as they ve never opened before the millionaire is david niven and he goes along with it and the various situations that are engendered by the mistake cesar romero has some good moments here as the frantic producer of this musical in the end though happy go lovely is light and harmless fluff which david niven did so much of and got so tired of
i m a sucker for a good romance but this one doesn t qualify as either good or a romance i had the plot nailed down before the credits were through with such poor dialog plot and character development i suggest investing your hour and a half elsehere i had to rush out and rent serendipity for the third time so i could get the bad taste of this one out of my mouth
before the release of george romero s genre defining night of the living dead zombies were relatively well behaved creatures they certainly had much better table manners in the old days but social etiquette aside what thrills did these early zombies offer to the movie going public judging by this film none whatsoever the story is about an expedition to cambodia whose purpose is to find and destroy the secret of zombiefication one of the party discovers the secrets on his own and sets about building his zombie army this film is basically a love triangle with zombies but seeing as this is a s movie the said zombies are more like somnambulists than the flesh eating variety we think of today they seem to respond to mind control rather than insatiable appetites and quite frankly the revolt is somewhat underwhelming too the whole thing is really very dull aside from the lack of horror there isn t any over the top melodramatic theatrics to keep us entertained it seems unlikely that this could ve provided much entertainment even years ago see it if you have to see everything with zombie in the title but otherwise i would advise skipping this one
i read all the reviews here after watching this piece of cinematic garbage and it took me at least pages to find out that somebody else didn t think that this appallingly unfunny montage wasn t the acme of humour in the s or indeed in any other era if this isn t the least funny set of sketch comedy i ve ever seen it ll do till it comes along half of the skits had already been done and infinitely better by acts such as monty python and woody allen if i was to say that a nice piece of animation that lasts about seconds is the highlight of this film it would still not get close to summing up just how mindless and drivel ridden this waste of minutes is seminal comedy only in the world where seminal really does mean semen scatological humour only in a world where scat is actually feces precursor jokes only if by that we mean that this is a handbook of how not to do comedy tits and bums and the odd beaver nice if you are a pubescent boy with at least one hand free and haven t found out that playboy exists give it a break because it was the early s no way there had been sketch comedy going back at least ten years prior the only way i could even forgive this film even being made is if it was at gunpoint retro hardly sketches about clowns subtly perverting children may be cutting edge in some circles and it could actually have been funny but it just comes off as really quite sad what kept me going throughout the entire minutes sheer belief that they may have saved a genuinely funny skit for the end i gave the film a because there was no lower score and i can only recommend it to insomniacs or coma patients or perhaps people suffering from lockjaw their jaws would finally drop open in disbelief
i just watched this movie in high definition on television i am in a wheelchair due to a neuromuscular disorder and like to watch the few films made about those with physical disabilities at first i found the main character somewhat noble and captivating his message about the disabled and the life time he spent fighting to have the disabled recognized and integrated into mainstream society s job market is great and my problem isn t with the real person who did these things he was a great man but this film is completely hypocritical and diametrically opposed to the very message it is preaching that i found it insulting first of all they didn t cast anyone in a title role with an actual physical disability sure they were competent actors but it seems completely dis genuine to preach about hiring the disabled and then not actually hiring the disabled for anything in the film further compounded by the fact that in one scene mid way through the film a man is seen walking to a podium on crutches appearing to have only one leg but the cgi in this scene is so apparent it is shameful what they couldn t find an actual amputee anywhere for the film for a second shot it was more financially sound to do cgi effects than to just hire an actual amputee at that point in the film i found it so fraudulent and completely against the message it was trying to convey that i came here to bitch and whine about it like the pathetic cripple i am figure that out
the best thing i can say about this film is that it is well paced it did not fall flat the next best things are the supporting performances by the actor playing foppish groom to be edward the always marvelous holland taylor and the actor playing taylor s husband the actor helping to critique messing s potential outfits in an early scene brings a delightful absurd yet winning quality to the proceedings okay that s about it on the positive side dermot mulroney whom i adore is far more believable expressing contempt for messing than in any scene where he s attempting to be either businesslike or supporting as others noted he appears to have no emotional investment in this enterprise other than wrapping it up as quickly as possible messing on the other hand sincerely tries to carry the film and to create the illusion of chemistry with mulroney she is adequate doing so but is simply not strong enough an actress to pull all of this off without help give her an e for effort and a c for achievement given mulroney s indifference the one thing that could ve helped messing would have been a brilliantly cavalier irons esquire performance from the actor playing her ex fianc jeffrey instead his performance is weak kneed mewling and feckless if i tried to analyze this one any further i d obviously be paying more attention than most of the people involved it s harmless enough to pass time if you have nothing else to do and less obnoxious and less creative than the wedding singer but you re much better off watching my best friend s wedding again
i would have enjoyed this movie slightly more had not been for jason herb evers constant harping on experiment many early reviewers of the seven samurai accused toshiro mifune of overacting yet as more and more critics viewed that film they saw it as being purposefully done jason evers is obviously not toshiro mifune and his overacting is exactly that most of the actors in this b classic were rather good actors minus evers and the showgirls if you watch this movie you would have noticed evers shouting almost every line that is until he is smoking and blowing the smoke coolly out his nose the special effects were par for the course in a b movie such as this one in hindsight there isn t much that stands out in my mind as fantastically good or bad for this movie
seemingly intended to be a thriller of a movie winds up being almost laughable it prompted me to exclaim oh my god more than once at the convoluted contrivances of plot that were just plain silly fanciful or absurd locations just for the sheer novelty or dramatic situation and improbable near impossible human reactions and circumstances are too much to be comprehended as to why they exist if you have the time and wish to discover just how bad a picture can be then you will want to see this one otherwise dedicate some time into watching some paint dry for a more productive investment of time that a film released in is already being shown on tv in july might give an indication of the film s quality
ok i have been a huge fan of the black for a long time and was disgusted after seeing this film let s name the problems first this film has much of the same crew that the first two had it has also been called the prequel to the original black stallion why is it that they can t get shetan s dam s name correct or her color in the black stallion returns we learn the sagr was the black s chestnut mother and in this film she is a gray mare name jenny wtf and it s set in africa in and i could be wrong but the first one was set in the s as well when the ship wrecks time line doesn t sound quite right to me also as a goof there is a friesian in the beginning of the movie that is supposed to be shetan s father upon further notice it appears to be a gelding ben ishaak is the only character that remained to even make this film appear to be related to the previous two in any way might be a cute family film to some but it s my biggest movie disappointment of the year
i literally fell asleep times watching this movie granted it s shakespeare and that takes a certain mindset to be interested or not but this movie exceeds any barrier of long soliloquies and what not that may prevent many from just not caring about a shakespeare based story the largest roadblock to this production is the complete flatness of the characters often during character s interacting it s nearly difficult to distinguish who s lines are who s granted i believe this movie is dubbed in english certainly they could ve obtained voice actors which could ve added a bit more drama to these classic literary lines it would be difficult to rate this movie greater than although perhaps that s based on prejudices of perhaps age and what would seem a very low budget still it s absolutely painful and boring if you insist on hamlet do yourself a favor and read the book again
i was very disappointed by this film for a few reasons for the first half hour it s actually pretty decent although the acting isn t any better then that which you would find in a rap video its kinda funny and the production value doesn t seem half bad in fact i almost thought this would be almost as good as perico ripiao another recent dominican film which turned out to be much much better than i expected the plot for the movie revolves around not just cheating husbands but how women are viewed and treated in dominican society as a whole which makes for a good premise especially in the dominican republic unfortunately i don t think the makers of this film relies that a good movie is all about how you treat your subject matter and they f ing butchered the veal cutlet they had before them about minutes into the movie the roles of men and women are reversed after the main characters wife puts a kind of spell on him as a result of his cheating habits not only does this transition happen via what look to be cutting edge space age cgi effects dating to what i m guessing would be the s but the whole plot just goes down the drain the rest of the movie is nothing but cheesy predictable situations and clever one liners to top it all off and i guess i should warn you now spoiler alert it all turns out to be a dream oh my who didn t see that coming oh man i almost forgot the most ridiculous thing about the movie well after about an hour into it i start thinking hmmmm something just doesn t seem right about the sound track but what can it be and then it hits me half of the music in the movie was taken from a video game called king of fighter when oh when dr will you give us a film we can call a work of art perhaps a comedy to match france s amelie or an action flick to match thailand s ong bak an animation as akira was to japan a witty crime thriller as layer cake was to england or a socio awakening journey as waking life had here in the states i would give it a but i ve seen much worse come out of dr search los jodedores and you ll know what i m talking about
i was really disappointed with this film the first waters movie i saw was serial mom and i loved it then i saw pecker and i loved it then i watched polyester and really sort of hated it the only thing i liked about that movie was divine she he had a hell of a lot of talent i was truly surprised as a whole i wouldn t recommend this film
manmohan desai made some entertaining though illogical films like aaa parvarish and naseeb but he made some craps like coolie and mard and then gjsthis movie is one of the worst movies ever made by him the dial became famous mard ko dard nahin hota but the film is so bad you cringethe british are made carricatures and the film looks so weird the scene in the british hotel is damn stupid the film has many stupidities like amrita assaulting amitabh and then the entire scene plus towards the climax the film becomes even worse there are more gems like the horse statue getting life the masks of amitabh haha and moredirection by manmohan desai is bad music is okayamitabh does his part with style nothing different from coolie laawaris type roles amrita singh is okay satyen kapuu is okay prem chopra is as usual nirupa roy is again her usual self dara singh is also as usual
this was such a waste of time danger if you watch it you will be tempted to tear your dvd out of the wall and heave it thru the window an amateur production terrible repetitive vacuous dialog paper thin plot line wooden performances lucy lawless was pathetically hackneyed seriously flawed story completely unbelievable characters the two worst concepts in film and t v are the evil twin amnesia there are no twins the plot twist outrageously simplistic and obvious like watching a train coming down the track in the middle of the day on the prairies it doesn t even resolve properly the evil is not punished for the original crime please please please don t watch this even if its free and your only other choice is to go to a synagogue
i chuckled a few times during this movie i laughed out loud during the notarizing of the margarine company handover pun intended there are three segments in this movie the first one is supposed to be a spoof of woman grows up and launches career movies the tampax box was the funniest thing in this segment most of the cast members aren t listed here on imdb they are the lucky ones few other people will be able to connect this thing to the ruin of their acting careers the second segment is a spoof of sharkish woman sleeps her way to the top and seizes control of huge industry movies robert culp has several funny moments all physical humor including the aforementioned handover after his character dies the segment sinks lower and lower as dominique corsaire rises higher and higher by the time she becomes first lady i wanted to rip the cable out of the tv and watch snow i switched to pakistani music videos instead i don t understand urdu or whatever language the videos were in it was still better than listening to the dialogue in this painfully dull story then came municipalians with the big stars half of them on screen for less than a minute elisha cook jr christopher lloyd rhea perlman henny youngman julie kavner richard widmark and robby benson it s supposed to be a spoof of young cop teams with hardened substance abusing older cop who needs retirement badly movies the horizontal flash bar on the police car is very impressive it was interesting seeing old rtd buses and a shell gas station sign and an american savings sign none of them are around anymore nagurski s never stop anywhere you might have to get out the car made me smile momentarily then they discuss how boring the young cop is a lot back and forth about how boring he is that was as boring as this description of how boring it is nagurski s law number four never go into a music store that s been cut into with an acetylene torch made me think that the music store is a real business at the actual location the dispatcher gave thinking about that was more interesting than the set up for the gag which followed young falcone benson gets shot a lot he becomes a hardened cop like nagurski the segment keeps going on and on and on it won t stop it rolls relentlessly onward no matter how many times you wish he d just die already so this thing will end it doesn t it goes on and on and on then a buffy the vampire slayer episode which i ve seen four times already comes on thank god this abysmal movie ended while i went to get the mail
i am sick and tired of all these little weenies going on about how this movie rocked it is pure cg over acted crap don t send an assassin it s much more sensible to smuggle hundreds of brightly colored aggressive venomous snakes on a plane the only reason people like this movie because they feel they have to it is not so bad it s good it s so bad i d rather be poked in the eye with a sharp stick then be subjected to this again i honestly thought was going to be a comedy like airplane a spoof was i wrong it s that whole it sucks get it or samuel a jackson yells snakes on the plane thing well i m sorry i don t get it it looks like a bunch of wimps gave the movie industry more money to make more movies like triple x and die hard if you what spend money to watch a movie in the company of the same people who bought william hung s cd still live in their mommies basement and stink of plastic chair sweat from days on the computer playing online games and looking at porn then rush to the theater and ask for one since i doubt you have a girlfriend ticket for snakes on a stupid butt plane to hell with movies like full metal jacket pulp fiction true romance monkeys clerks etc there s no irony in watching good movies the true decline of the western civilization calling this a cult film is an insult to true cult classics like repo man or even orgazmo i ve said enough here
an intriguing premise of hand drawn fantasy come to life in a child s fever dreams however i imagine the average nonfictional child is far more adept at scaring themselves than bernard rose is at riveting the viewer the duel between anna s two realities drags on far too long to sustain interest especially considering that the little girl playing her is the most abrasive child actor i ve ever seen use only for kindling
yet another die hard straight to video rip off with cardboard villains how many more of these god awful cheaply and badly made rip off of the more popular action movies of the late s and early s are there still lurking out there for the record not that you will care really this one is yet another blatant rip off of a combination of die hard under siege and speed complete with a full complement of clich s and predictability the non descript villains are the usual selection of cardboard cut out gun toting thugs who are dispatched by various means as the film progresses the hero naturally is an ex cop or something that has family and attitude problems and of course he brings along to the party not only the usual emotional baggage but also a matching piece of eye candy and his annoying son the supposed luxury cruise liner that is running between florida and mexico is carefully described as a cross between a liner and a ferry this goes someway to explaining how come they appear to be larking around on a rusty cross channel ferry in new zealand the acting is as wooden as the deck the script woeful the one liners predictable the villains utterly inept and the plot has holes in it you could sail a boat through there seems to be a never ending tide of this sort of rip off straight to video rubbish polluting the late night slots of television and the dvd bargain bins of supermarkets everywhere although even this film is so bad it has yet to see a dvd release yet but give it time is there any chance of something at least half decently made semi believable and most important original no i thought not
this is the most elementary sort of traditional ghost story not even enlivened to any great extent by the use of irish locations if the great m r james had ever come up with a tale this thin doesn t james in fact have a story called a thin ghost he wouldn t have bothered to have it published orson welles appears in the limp endpieces as a favour to a brace of old friends this film s producers his presence and the one movie industry in joke would have earned this will o the wisp its oscar nomination this is yet more proof if any more were needed that the academy awards have never been any guarantee of merit
this weekend just passed i watched weeks later which was very good after that i watched this film i have tell you it is one of the most boring so called horror you could ever watch the scenes were unrealistic there was no script and no plot the alien creature was unreal and the fight scenes mild compared to a school yard fight and to make it worse the guy named cody had an uncontrollable loose filthy tongue which distracts attention from the main film forget about this movie rather go and watch weeks later cheers mesake c
by the time this film was released i had seen chorus line on stage times and had been anticipating most eagerly the long rumored production of a film of the story my wife and i were in line hours before the box office opened on the day the film was released it was not just a disappointment it was a kick in the abdomen first the story was moved outside so to speak by including scenes not in the confines of the theater those confines are a large portion of the meaning and impact of the story second third together assign your own order one of the original songs with very dynamic dance number was removed a song which was not in the stage production was added say what i m confused the only reason i gave this film stars instead of is my admiration for the talent and hard work of the performers i ve now seen chorus line on stage times and wouldn t mind seeing it more times before i die it is superbly written with wonderful music and heart wrenchingly true stories if you want to see a musical which includes a great cattle call audition i recommend all that jazz if you want to see the story of a chorus line see it on stage
i went in expecting the movie to be completely dumb with such a low expectation any form of entertainment would be a pleasant surprise the soundtrack was the best part of the movie but poking fun at the nonsense that goes on in singles wards was also amusing this said there were many things about the singles ward that were completely annoying the entire film was poorly dubbed and made watching mouths while listening to their voices very irritating this lack of professionalism was surpassed only by the cameos of mormon celebrities who have no business acting this film will do well among mormondom especially in college communities where singles ward exist however the conclusion will offer no hope for the poor losers who find themselves unmarried only the pretty girls in the singles ward get married the fat ugly ones don t but all the ugly men do ultimately we realize that the whole film was an advertisement for ldssingles com
i love morgan freeman paz vega is an attractive appealing and talented actress i m sure that this would have been a good movie had anything happened in it nothing does it s short less than minutes it was minutes too long after an hour of frustration i scanned through the remaining odd minutes excruciating freeman plays an actor who hasn t worked in a while researching a part that he might play as a checkout clerk in a supermarket he visits the supermarket where she works nothing happens she decides to give him a ride home and they go to an arby s a target a car wash nothing happens they converse about their lives nothing happens ever i don t get it but i also don t get the bill murray flicks lost in translation and broken flowers if you like those movies maybe you ll like this lots of people find movies like this whimsical charming or for reasons that escape me find the dialog fascinating a common device in movies of this ilk is to have a long take of stillness silence after an actor delivers a line that s supposed to be meaningful we know it s meaningful because it s followed by two minutes of nothing on the screen sorry i must be a philistine i don t get it to me these kinds of movies aren t funny or charming or thought provoking they re just boring why because there s no comedy no drama no tension no laughs no suspense no action nothing to watch in short none of the things i go to the movies for i can be bored for free i see oddball quirky characters in real life i go to target and fast food restaurants and car washes these elements do not a movie make even if stars are doing this stuff i pay to be entertained if you re crazy about morgan freeman and just like to hear him ramble on about nothing have fun if you wanna drool over paz vega you can look and listen to her but nothing happens i promise a total snoozefest
it just seems bizarre that someone read this script and thought this is funny i mean it s so hilarious it just has to be made who was this person is he or she the person really responsible for this are they the one s who owe me for my time more so than the director writer this film stinks in most every way possible there s no one shred of good dialogue and not one likable character and the story i prefer the nd worst movie ever hulk hogan s no hold s barred to this by quite a considerable degree it seems almost shakespearen in comparison the ending is padded out with several minutes of outtakes and it s still under minutes the outtakes include cast members laughing at the hilarious mistakes they ve made and things that went wrong on the set of this comedy glad to see someone laughing in someway with some connection to this film nothing in this film is funny nothing it just goes on and on it s truly that lame i love films that are so bad they re good this is so bad it s something but i don t know what and hopefully will never find out amanda peet doesn t suck outright and is in fact the only half good thing about this wannabe film but that really means little avoid at all costs
next to the slasher films of the s and s ones about the walking dead were probably the second most popular horror sub genre while slasher films had black christmas and halloween to get the whole thing going zombie flicks had george romero s dead films and unsurprisingly soon after the success of his first two in the series other directors wanted to cash in a lot of italian directors were especially interested such as lucio fulci who brought us zombie a year after romero s dawn of the dead known as zombi in italy and some other countries and it was there that fulci s film was known as zombi apart from the walking dead it has no relation to romero s film but is a good film in it s own right it was a big success in europe and years later a sequel was born pros lots of beautiful lush scenery awesome score the acting isn t exactly good but the cast is game and seem to be enjoying the experience after kind of a slow start the pace moves along like that of an action flick plenty cheese and unintentional hilarity for bad film lovers good job on the make up effects lots of blood and some decent gore cons virtually plot less nothing you haven t already seen before blatantly rips off some things from the first couple of return of the living dead films cardboard characters hasn t aged too well due to the bad s rock music not that i m saying all rock music of that period is bad clothing and overall feel of the movie final thoughts first of all this is not a true sequel to fulci s cult classic in fact i don t know if it was ever meant to pick up where that film left off for those that don t know fulci was ill during production and ended up leaving and was replaced with bruno mattei mattei s films are pretty laughable but like this film many are good campy fun and that s all this film really is just something to watch for fun my rating so bad it s good rating serious rating
spirit of a murdered high school geek animates a scarecrow which then takes revenge on everyone this movie really annoyed me it has a great looking monster has some good low budget effects some atmosphere but manages to short circuit the good stuff with bad half way in i started to fast forward and then step through the chapters on the dvd the problems with this movie are many first off the cast looks about thirty and yet they are suppose to be in high school you don t believe anything from the get go as a result the scarecrow while looking great isn t much beyond that he says stupid one liners and moves in a manner more designed to be funny then scary is this a comedy or a horror movie its a problem that goes beyond the one liners to much of the dialog and set up it seems more send up of every clich than heartfelt horror film i some how expect that the film was made for a very narrow audience in mind horror fans who want to mock the genre rather than embrace it despite the good looking monster this is a film to avoid even if you pick it up in the bargain bin for under five bucks you re paying too much avoid
saving grace is surely one of the leading contenders for the how to ruin an adequate film in the final few minutes award naturally if you mix a quaint cornish village largely populated by retired genteel ladies with a liberal dose of marijuana a certain amount of silliness will ensue however the last seven minutes of the film descend into the totally ludicrous and is not even redeemed by being particularly funny it is a real shame because this comedy has the potential to be every bit as good as s waking ned devine which also portrayed a picturesque small village and its oddball inhabitants trying to extract themselves from a tricky situation the protagonist of saving grace is middle aged recently widowed grace trevethyn whose husband s legacy of bad debts has forced her into an unconventional way of earning money helped by her gardener matthew she turns her horticultural expertise to the lucrative cultivation of marijuana unfortunately this leads her into confrontation with the local police her husband s creditors and a french drug baron whom all turn up at her greenhouse simultaneously the relationship and rapport between grace and matthew is well portrayed and brenda blethyn gets the viewer emotionally involved with her likeable character you can really feel what she is going through the casting of the minor roles is excellent even if some of them are rather outlandishly eccentric however the transformation of jacques the drug lord into grace s romantic interest is highly implausible and does not fit the tone of the movie at all and surely hydroponics is not such a revolution in the world of cannabis growing sadly the film swaps gentle humour for slapstick and ends up being as fake as the marijuana plants
the turgid pace of this movie numbs us to any shocks that it might provide there was no real suspense most of the characters were insipid the chesty irish priest was as lame as the love interest interest is misleading the girl that they chose to provide the film s sensuality might be better the central conflict of the main character was uninvolving this film is entirely devoid of positives it is like a tedious exercise by someone who didn t want to go to the gym that day but did anyway
i live in ottawa where this film was made and i really wish it hadn t been this is one god awful flick i really try and support independent films but there is this stigma attached to anything indie and that stigma is indie films blow well this film does nothing to shed this curse the actor writer director brett kelly does little to contribute to the genre rather he re hashes tired clich s from movies past i am really tired of menacing evil looking characters that lurk in the shadows and prey on the unsuspecting it s way too overdone i can remember one scene in particular right near the end of the flick where the whole scene is lit with car headlights now some may say that this was an effect used to create mood and tension but sadly it was to showcase the shoestring budget of this movie as well for a movie that dares to call itself horror a viewer will find themselves hard pressed to find any actual gore other than a few scenes with corn syrup and red food colouring the biggest thing that drags this film down is the pacing and the lack of character development the basic plot is that children are being kidnapped and the parents must track down this bonesetter fellow before a certain time in order to get their kids back not that this concept bugs me but i didn t really find it believable that when the two main characters both who have lost children can find time to make out with each other this is done in such a short time span that it s inconceivable my first priority would be to get my daughter back and at least get to know the lady before making out with her the last point that i have is and i won t hold this against kelly but the movie is shot entirely on boring emotionless video and that really takes away from any tense moments that would have just oozed style on film although if this movie were given a million dollar makeover and redone the story and boring acting and lame everything could not keep this movie afloat my only hope is that something happens to prevent brett kelly from making a sequel which has been reported on his website a sequel that was half written in one sitting lord help us all

don t waste your time on this film it could have been good but the ending was one of the lamest i ve ever seen i seriously have to wonder how the people involved with the making of this film could ve looked at that final scene and thought yeah now there s an ending and patted themselves on the back about it to me it seemed more like they just ran out of ideas they built up the final scenes to have a cool twist but instead just let the whole build up fall flat on it s face when the last shot faded to black and i heard the credit music starting i was in shock i could not believe what i was seeing and that someone could even call that an ending the best thing anyone could do with this film is rewrite the end and give it some substance seriously i d really love to get whoever came up with that one in a room look them in the face and say wtf
actually they don t but they certainly did when trying to think of a singular line that adequately summarises how terrible this entry in the series really is there were some moments that could have been good but they are mostly outweighed by their own conversion into missed opportunities and don t get me started on the bad the wasted opportunities are pretty obvious but i will recap them here in case anyone cares anyone who hasn t seen the film and genuinely gives a toss would be advised to stop reading at this point the first and potentially the biggest wasted opportunity was the plot with freddy s long lost child now the extreme mental illness that freddy appears to suffer and i might hasten to add that less than one percent of mental patients are a threat to other people leave alone to this extent is hereditary so why not a mystery type slasher in which lisa zane s character dreams of freddy murdering the teens only we later discover it s actually her doing all the killing sound like a good plot idea to you obviously it was above the heads of talalay and de luca then there s the trip to springfield where the entire adolescent population has been wiped out and the remaining adults are experiencing a kind of mass psychosis funnily enough said mass psychosis was actually depicted in a realistic and convincing manner although this has a fair amount to do with the fact that we are never shown too much we are just given quick visual hints of the massive loss of connection with reality that would stem from the grief of every youngster in town dying for reasons beyond one s comprehension and control the essential problem with this plot element however is that the town is abandoned too quickly and with no real answers this collection of scenes would have been far creepier with ten minutes of say one sane citizen explaining to these visitors why the springfield fair looks like a horror show of course horror films are never noted for their character development unless they re the kind of horror films john carpenter used to direct but how are we supposed to really care when characters we know next to nothing about die at least wes craven took the time to set up his characters in the original and used a few cheap tricks to draw the audience in that in a nutshell is probably the biggest problem with freddy s dead it just doesn t try at all leave alone hard enough on a related note i feel kind of sorry for robert englund now that he is more or less inextricably linked with the freddy character he has played far better characters in far better productions the science fiction miniseries v for example and to be forever remembered as the man who played freddy is selling him rather short it seems he will never break the mold of horror films now as for the rest of the cast well i think their performances here speak for themselves they deserved to be permanently typecast as little more than b grade horror props even yaphet kotto doesn t escape this one unscathed as his character is one of the most childishly written in the history of b films all in all freddy s dead gets a out of me i d vote lower but the imdb doesn t allow for that fd is really a testament to how a writer s inability to exploit a concept to the fullest extent can ruin not only a film but an entire franchise
this is indeed a god adaptation of jane austen s novel compared with the american version with guinneth paltrow the script was written to resemble as much as possible the book but the acting was awful besides kate beckinsale who i believe was a true likeness of the emma in the book all the other actors were trying too hard mark strong was not the gentleman he was supposed to be he was often rude and offensive had no feeling whatsoever and throughout the entire film you could not see his love growing for emma at all this had a terrible effect on kate beckinsale who seemed to be trying to resque her leading role as well as her partner s moreover there was no chemistry between the entire cast hariett smith played by samantha morton seemed to have no real attachment to mr elton played by dominic rowan therefore she did not seem as heartbroken as she was portrayed in the book the settings of the film are also too poor the costumes are even more so i would have imagined emma woodhouse to dress in a more fashionable and elegant way that she does here the ending is also too long it is good that it resembles the book s ending but it is a killer ending for a film and again i can see no feeling of happiness in the face of mr knightley to conclude i believed this adaptation to be loyal to the book but with poor actors it seemed as if the film was made without any budget at all i would prefer to see the lighter version with paltrow and northam even if it is clear that it was made to be a blockbuster than to watch these actors excepting the good olivia williams and the better kate beckinsale ruin the entire script
i was enjoying this movie most of the time but i kept getting the feeling that i was watching a children s movie i honestly think that somebody wrote a pg script and then while filming decided to add in some blood nudity and language it was a big let down there s that believe the children magic that exists in movies like babe the pig or angels in the outfield that defeats the evil tooth fairy the parents end up believing their daughter about her ability to see the ghost and utilize this skill to supernaturally defeat the tooth fairy when i bought this movie i thought it would be a b film response to the dreadful darkness falls somehow manage to make a better film with of the money but they don t they made a worse film and will probably lose the same proportion of money lost on darkness falls
this started bad got worse and by the time the girl attacked the old lady at the end i literally wanted to take the dvd to the person we borrowed it off and choke the c t to death with it avoid this film a little bit of good cinematography and some naked shots would be almost acceptable if i was and had not seen jenna jameson naked a million times if anyone feels the need to watch this film i would strongly recommend you spend the time more appropriately as an example i would say trying to cram a lego house into your bum with no lube would be a good start i hear that this film was not the original version i would very much like to view the original as it seems that this cut version is devoid of all plot and apparently most of the nudity can someone please tell me how i can get in touch with christian viel he owes me an hour of my life back
the second attempt by a new york intellectual in less than years to make a swedish film the first being susan sontag s brother carl which was made in sweden with swedish actors no less the results oscar wilde said it best in reference to dickens the old curiosity shop one would have to have a heart of stone not to laugh out loud at the death of little nell pretty much the same thing here interiors is chock full of solemnly intoned howlers i m afraid of my anger looking into the middle distance i don t like who i m becoming the directorial quotations to use a polite term from bergman are close to parody the incredibly self involved family keep reminding us of how brilliant and talented they are to the point of strangulation i read a poem of yours the other day it was in i don t know the new yorker oh that was an old poem i reworked it far from not caring about these people however i found them quite hilarious much of the dialog is exactly like the funny stuff from allen s earlier films only he s directed his actors to play the lines straight having not cast himself in the movie he has poor mary beth hurt copy all of his thespian tics intonations and neurotic habits turning her into an embarrassing surrogate much like kenneth branagh in celebrity the basic plot dysfunctional family with quietly domineering mother seems to be lifted more or less from bergman s winter light the basic family melodrama tricked up with a lot of existential angst it all comes through in the shopworn visual aural tricks the deafening scratching of a pencil on paper the towering surf that dwarfs the people walking on the beach etc etc allen s later serious films are less embarrassing but also far less entertaining i ll take interiors woody s rarely made a funnier movie
i started watching this movie expecting some barely tolerable hammer horror film wannabe and i wasn t far off there s a fair amount of glimpsed gore and they threw in lots of nudity but the latter half of the movie presents a few ironic twists holy cow they actually put a little thought into the story and didn t completely fall into the predictable stuff one expected at the outset and dare i say it some of the gratuitous nudity wasn t so gratuitous after all because it fit in with the story and setting don t get me wrong it s still overall a bad movie but as bad movies go it s a shade more intelligent than the really horrible tripe like mesa of lost women and robot monster
i should have trusted my instincts better no expectations no disappointments instead however i expected to experience a similar masterpiece like koyaanisqatsi and was brutally disappointed powaqqatsi is in my humble opinion nothing but a cheap attempt to cash in on the cult success of its predecessor and artistically it fails miserably it appears some producer gathered up leftover material from koyaanisqatsi hurriedly threw it together placed everything in slow motion and got some pop entertainer under the pseudonym of philip glass to hurriedly throw together some banal background music which is incessantly repeated where koyaanisqatsi entertains the viewer with clever fast and slow motion changes powaqqatsi is one long sequence of mundane images in slow motion if you view them on your vcr in fast preview mode you ll see what i mean what disappointed me the most however was philip glass s soundtrack i couldn t and still can t believe that these commercial sounding new age type drones which could easily have been composed in one afternoon by any year old on a casio calculator were from the same composer who so brilliantly composed the emotional and perfectly synchronized music for koyaanisqatsi all in all a big waste of time my advice forget commercialism watch koyaanisqatsi again instead
the line is funnier in england where away from vixen s native america the word fanny has a whole new meaning sadly it s the only laugh you ll get in this terrible sex comedy that is neither sexy nor funny oddly unalluring with painted on eyebrows erica gavin acting ability zero is a nymphomaniac who lusts after her own brother but rejects his black friend while making derogatory remarks about watermelons as if in revenge he asks her if she would go with a shetland pony reference is also made to making it with monkeys gavin s ability to shake and tremble with orgasmic pleasure at the slightest touch is matched only in it s lack of appeal by her seduction dance which involves a bonfire and a haddock personally i preferred the haddock for this was pretty tame stuff and belies the controversy it attracted at the time a character claims to be getting stoned though it s only on bourbon and for one of the original x certificates there s no full frontal nudity just six years later we would be getting timmy lea and his confessions but here we have to make do with topless shots only gavin s final seduction of her own brother really shocks another activity for vixen is where she helps settle the sexual problems between a married couple by sleeping with them both the two women clearly aren t enjoying acting out their scene together and make a poor effort to disguise it after vixen irons out their disharmony the romantic husband concludes of his wife i guess she s got it coming to her the only near worthwhile segment involves an unusual discussion of cuban communism it seems out of place with the rest of the film though is spliced with shots of gavin s breasts to rope it in to continuity this then leads into a vague anti vietnam stance which is commendable though dropped in the middle of such a frivolous film it seems trite and insensitive not to say downright tasteless incidentally the part of would be communist niles brooke is taken by harrison page the same harrison page who played captain trunk in amusing comedy sledge hammer page must be embarrassed by his back catalogue which also includes meyer s beyond the valley of the dolls though meyer apologists would have you believe the terrible dialogue lousy acting sloppy direction and dire editing are not just part of the charm but wholly intentional as a defence it fails to hold water the irritating incidental music a cross between the tunes they play in cinema restaurant ads and muzak used by tv stations when the transmission breaks down is omnipresent and intrusive while even the silly amateurishly skewed camera angles can t generate interest a wonderful world of jazz saxophones where women have been asking for it black men or shines aren t good enough for anyone and rape is an acceptable form of revenge absolutely abysmal
i saw this movie originally in the theater when i was even at that age the humor was mildly insulting to my adolescent intelligence in the past whenever i would see ed begley jr or jeff goldblum i would cringe and start to feel very uncomfortable and even slightly sad until i was reminded of the existence of this movie today i was unsure why i felt that way apparently i blocked my memory of this movie yet my negative feelings towards two of the perpetrators remained apparently i forgot that i saw this movie but subconsciously mourned the pieces of my soul that had been stolen nay eaten by the creators of this inhuman work i haven t been brave enough to try watching it as an adult i imagine that as part of the healing process that i should probably look at confronting this childhood fear so that i can truly put it behind me some regression therapy and or hypnosis might not be a bad idea either
although there were some amusing moments i thought the movie was pretty lame the longer it ran the worse it got once the action entered monument valley i found myself watching the magnificent outcroppings more than the increasingly silly and unconvincing interaction of the characters the character of the daughter was particularly incoherent first she s in on the deal then discovers the truth and she bails then she s back again then deserts them again then she s back again there s no apparent motivation for any of her decisions there were interesting characters some interesting scenes and many missed possibilities i would have to say the pictures was much less than the sum of its parts apparently the people who liked repo man were inclined to like this one searchers is no match for the searchers
so i had low expectations for this movie to start with but it failed to meet even those while there were some funny parts even one or two laugh out loud parts this movie fell terribly short of what i would call good the funniest jokes were unexpected and over very quickly leaving us sitting there going wtf just happened in addition there were a few jokes that just dragged on and on and on the part where he falls down the mountain had me yawning also the editing was really lacking there were some poor scene transitions but that seems to be the style nowadays it made me laugh but i wouldn t watch it again and i m very glad i waited for it to rent give it a chance you might enjoy it but don t think you are in for anything along the lines of the year old virgin or superbad
this movie doesn t have an awful lot to do with it s predecessor robot jox this must be also the reason why its most common name is robot wars and not the alternate name robot jox robot wars robot jox was basically a fun movie to watch because it had a nice premise of giant robots battling each other in the near future this concept has been abandoned for this movie and instead it features a totally dull story that besides isn t very original or cleverly written a shame it tried to be so much different from its predecessor really for else this perhaps could had been a more fun movie to watch just like robot jox this is a b movie but with as a big difference that it s just not a very good one perhaps this also has to with the fact that robot jox got made during the s when b movies still had a certain bit of charm and class over it even though the movie got released in this really can t be said about this movie it s just lame badly made poor looking and not exciting enough it also has an ending which leaves you thinking this is it that s all what the movie its story is lacking is good clear main plot line really perhaps a good main villain would had been a good idea and some other stuff such as an actual point to the story some action or likable main characters seriously what were they thinking when they picked the actors for this movie all of them are simply not likable in their roles and especially don michael paul is annoying as the main character who behaves as if he s god s gift to woman and mr perfect who can compete with anyone weren t they even simply able to get the actors from the first movie for such a futuristic movie with a concept of having large battle droids in it this movie surely is lacking with its action had they put some more and bigger action into the movie the movie would at least had been a more entertaining one to watch instead now we have a movie that fails to impress in basically every way imaginable you can better watch a mighty morphin power rangers episode for some more action and likability
and a few more no s on top of that voodoo academy is without a doubt the least ambitious film of all time what exactly is it trying to do tell a story obviously not as has been pointed out most of it s just barely legal guys rubbing themselves could it then be an attempt at subversive homoeroticism well maybe if not for the fact it never ever ever goes beyond the most innocuous and nonthreatening forms of male contact which is to the delight of none repeated about eighty thousand times well it is sort of a horror movie is it trying to scare us not unless the director meant to do so through the utter tedium and vacuousness of his work never in my life have i enjoyed a movie less this is the most boring and unnecessary thing i ve ever seen it s like voodoo academy takes the genres of horror zombie and gay movies puts them in a grinder then runs them through a coffee filter only instead of it being the kind of coffee filter that filters out coffee beans it s the kind that takes out everything vital edgy or in any way interesting the result is minutes of film every bit as exciting as a glass of warm water only without the ability to rehydrate you after the day gin binge that will inevitably befall you if you watch this abomination of human effort
this movie was probably the biggest waste of my life ever the acting was pathetic jordan hinson could not show any upset emotions at the beginning of the movie she was supposed to be discouraged instead she bobbed her head with her bottom lip stuck out she sobbed pitifully without any tears for the crying scene i was almost angry that out of all girls who wanted to be actresses they had to pluck out her everyone else was suffering from over acting as well it was flat out annoying it was also an insult to figure skaters jordan took a month to train and they cast her as a person who makes the olympic team it s practically spitting on the effort real figure skaters put into their work a pitiful excuse for a movie and a pitiful attempt to associate hockey and skating don t waste your life it doesn t even deserve one star
boom has garnered itself a something of a reputation with heavyweights taylor burton noel coward tennessee williams and joseph losey one might be tempted to think how bad could it be well it s a lot worse than you could possibly imagine the sad and disturbing fact of boom is that is seems to signal the decline and fall of the aforementioned heavyweights it was only director joseph losey who having plummeted the depths with modesty blaise and boom some may wish to add secret ceremony managed to recuperate and in create his best work the wonderful go between saddest of all is the work of tennesee williams from the mid forties until the early sixties williams penned a number of plays which have gained classic status remaining in theater repertory throughout the world many becoming much praised films when william s muse deserted him probably owing to his notorious substance abuse it deserted him for good williams at his best is an actor s dream providing many unforgettable performances were ava gardner or deborah kerr ever better than in night of the iguana taylor in particular shone in both cat on a hot tin roof and suddenly last summer there is an anecdote in which supposedly taylor asks john gielgud whether he would teach her to play shakespeare to which he replied if you will teach me to play tennessee williams had gielgud seen boom he would have held his tongue taylor simply has never been worse turning in a cringe inducing performance despite her face photographing well she is decidedly podgy besides the physical decline from this time onwards she would basically lose credibility as a serious actress with a string of completely forgettable and worse roles to her credit much the same could be said of burton following his short lived theatrical stardom he won fame and fortune in hollywood but the body of his work from this point onwards would be unremarkable to say the least noel coward had long ceased being a force in the theater where his drawing room comedies had been replaced by the likes of williams and the british angry young men he seems to be enjoying himself camping it up but barely manages to amuses that from the man who claimed such a talent the only cast member who maintains her dignity is young joanna shimkus who in a few years would forego a promising screen career to become mrs sidney poitier boom reeks of self indulgence it s simply out of control a rather sad pointer to careers gone wrong rather than a camp fun fest as some have suggested
this is the worst movie i have ever seen i was deceived into thinking it might be good because a couple of my favorite actors are in it now i want to punch jason schwartzman in the face for taking this role i was physically ill after watching this film i really don t understand hollywood sometimes there are so many people trying to break in that i m sure you can skim off the top and get the very best that way the worst movie you make is equivalent to ferris beullar instead of this sludge the gags like the hair doll and blatantly ripping off jeans commercials added to the humorlessness of the film glad i avoided this film and watched it on tv this proves that you should avoid january releases at all cost
i saw this for free thankfully and wish it was better than it was but it s really the same old stuff that movie studios seem to foist on us in the last ten years ben stiller and jennifer anniston play a couple who are opposites and yet they are attracted to each other if that plot line doesn t take you by surprise and thrill you the movie won t either lots of sight gags and fart jokes halfway through the movie i began to realize that ben stiller really isn t that funny but he tries very hard and jennifer anniston really isn t that pretty but her hair looks great and hank azaria and phillip seymore hoffman must have got paid a great deal of money to be in this kind of average ho hum movie i ve come to expect more from them what was interesting was that i saw this after i saw american splendor which is a truly funny and original movie and i compared the two in my head and found myself wishing that the movie executives would be forced to sit through those two movies back to back perhaps that would knock some sense into them andthey d start making better movies with unknowns rather than this formulaic stuff that plays best on airplanes
i just read a review defending this film because it had a low budget now my take on things the cgi monsters was reasonable well animated but was implemented in the worst possible way the fight scenes weren t even fights it was just one shot of an actor then one shot of monster with very interaction at all when the monster did interact it looked like it was done in paintshop pro in my opinion if you have a low budget you should use models and puppets they may not look as fancy but at least they interact just look at peter jacksons early films as for the acting beowulf did an descent job but the rest of the cast were either not trying or they forgot where they where the script seemed confused to me one minute they would be talking as if it were a modern day setting the next you get drama club shakespeare speech i m not say it should be all ye and that it be but you need to find a cohesive balance so the lines sound like they come from the same person i did notice one part near the start when beowulf was quoting the old testament which would have been find had he not spent the rest of the films talking about the gods and portents in short this film is a very slightly polished turd but a turn none the less
i am a dumber person for renting the dvd redline chicago pictures who made this stupid movie never paid palisades media group to buy web ads on various automotive sites including mine which has an alexa rating of k they ripped me off on the deal and now i am out and they wasted much of my personal time peter rapport of palisades media you know who you are please don t rent or buy this movie it sucks and the people behind it are ripoff artists redline has a cast of losers and poor actors this movie is a joke
return of the boogyman is a dreadful movie which doesn t play like a movie it plays like an episode of a tv sitcom when they flashback to older episodes return of the boogyman is just a clip show mutch of the film is constant and annoying flashbacks from the first movie over and over again the same footage how boring this is the movie really is about a psychic woman who has visions of the first movie i have seen the first movie i don t want to see the same scenes over and over again and i don t know who would the whole movie looks like it was quickly made to make a few bucks and thats it
okay so there aren t really that many great movies around recent gems like american dream the straight story and even toy story don t normally come so close together but boy does this film counter balance the quality i have no idea what these people thought they were doing are the financiers in this world so easily convinced to fund such a crock of i can just see it now producer so we ve got joe fiennes he s cute as a button and was pretty good in shakespeare in love and we ve got rhys ifans who isn t cute but was cool in notting hill we ll mix in a really mediocre score a few forgettable post britpop tunes hemlock root and lizard brains and hey presto you ve got the worst film of the new millennium and believe me it s gonna be a hard job to make anything as bad as this in the next thousand years the bank i like it any unnecessary sex bad camera movements and what about the worst accents this side of devil s own producer yeah we got plenty of those the bank sounds great where do we sign please
the story is seen before but that does n matter if you can figure out to make a proper storyboard it is clear that the director haven t spent his work on the storyboard alongside this the cameraman spent far too much time leaning angles that do not match the message of the movie the funniest is however if you take a look at the movie s website you can read that it was on purpose that the director has chosen to make the film with bad camera angles because it remind us about hunting but i have never heard of hunting with poor camera angles it will have stars because the story is ok it is a pity that ti west has not spent more time to review his story it is as if the movie was more important than the planning because you have a camera does not mean you should make a movie right away come everyone can make a movie but not all will be just as good so a word of advice to ti west are stop and labeling what you want use your time to start planning and not filming until everything has come down on a storyboard you certainly have the ability and desire so don t abuse your talent
ned akelly is such an important story to australians but this movie is awful it s an australian story yet it seems like it was set in america also ned was an australian yet he has an irish accent it is the worst film i have seen in a long time
i saw the movie as a child when it was released in the theater and it was so bad that it became the makings of a family joke if the ranking had a zero this movie would get it the dinosaurs were awful the storyline was ridiculous the acting really doesn t qualify to be called acting the only reason i even remember the name of the movie so well is because my family still talks about how bad it really was
i know you ve read that before on countless other films no doubt if you re reading the comments here but voodoo academy still stands as the absolute worst film i ve been able to track down no doubt the really bad ones aren t even available to buy or watch on tv but even so i feel it s fair to qualify that i m not just some dumb renter who picked badly i ve seen two thirds of the bottom ranked films here on the imdb and i m ticking of the remaining ones with every chance most of those stand head and shoulders above this excersize in absolute monotony i like to rate truly bad films as in ones with no humour even in how bad they are by how many people you need to watch it with to make it all the way through if you can watch it by yourself it isn t that bad if you can watch it with one single friend it s bad but could be a lot worse it took of us to make it all the way through voodoo academy and not even the usually fun moments of watching bad films spotting the boom mic for example times in this one if i m not mistaken could take away the dry taste in my mouth yes i d watched it but i d also forced of my friends to watch it with me to achieve that end i hope and pray we saw the directors cut to think that there could be a version with more minutes of big eyebrowed lugs with baby oil glands rubbing their torsos just scares the hell out of me so much of the film centers around this i do applaud david decoteau for managing to lens this film in two days on a short budget just as i applaud him for convincing people to pay him to make what is no doubt a celluloid version of some of his fetishes but it isn t a good film the original shop of horrors was shot in the same length of time for a comparitive amount of money considering inflation and was an utter gem it s not an excuse for how bad this baby is spoilers ahead it s not even worth picking apart the plot holes or cliched know it all hero characters the pacing of the film is insane nothing is interesting for the length of time decoteau dedicates to the pectoral self massaging no matter what your alignment or sex rubbing just cannot sustain that kind of screen time the acting is cheese but not overly amatuer i ve seen a lot worse in better films but somehow it s the semi competent delivery of some of the worst lines you ll ever hear in a film that really grates rent this if like me you have a fascination with the worst of the worst and only if you re going to watch it with a group of people who are prepared to work to get through it this is no ha ha ha the set wobbled affair it s an endurance test you probably want to skip i m sure there is worse but i wouldn t be surprised if it has decoteau s name on it
i wish i could give this movie a zero or even lower because sadly that s what it deserves i honestly never walk out of a movie but this one was so dreadfully awful that i couldn t stand another minute of it please please please for the sake of mankind skip this movie if you want a hot lesbian movie that you can really delve into this isn t it it has unattractive unappealing leads choppy structure ridiculous dialog and it is absolutely unconvincing in every imaginable way on an absolutely basic level it fails to entertain everything about mango kiss is so stagey it is worse than any student film i have seen as if that weren t enough the entire movie relies on constant and i mean constant voice over narration the script writer may as well have written a novel because they insisted on telling everything instead of showing it we are just supposed to assume that lou and sassafras are the best of friends and have a special connection even though there is no character development to illustrate this also this film continues to introduce to new characters after the first five minutes and not in a natural way but in a freeze frame of the characters with their name written over the screen there is no introduction no development of any of the characters we don t really get to know any of them this is the most amateur movie i have ever seen i am a gay woman who watched this film with my roommate another gay woman and we both found this movie to be a depressing representation of queer cinema i am beginning to think that lesbian and gay movies are a lot like christian rock it doesn t matter how atrocious it is people will still flock to it and champion it no matter how poor the quality is please don t rent this instead let s encourage the production of quality gay and lesbian movies by renting but i m a cheerleader or fire or heavenly creatures instead of swallowing whatever mindless tripe they aim at the gay community i e queer as folk
as a big fan of the original film it s hard to watch this show the garish set decor and harshly lighted sets rob any style from this remake the mood is never there instead it has the look and feel of so many television movies of the seventies crenna is not a bad choice as walter neff but his snappy wardrobe and swank apartment don t fit the mood of the original or make him an interesting character he does his best to make it work but samantha egger is a really bad choice the english accent and california looks can t hold a candle to barbara stanwick s velvet voice and sex appeal lee j cobb tries mightily to fashion barton keyes but even his performance is just gruff without style it feels like the tv movie it was and again reminds me of what a remarkable film the original still is
a very attractive and capable cast is lost in this deadly boring rehash of the slasher sub genre the plot a simply a collection of cliches and set pieces that we ve all seen a hundred times before has great potential as an insomnia treatment
it was great to see some of my favorite stars of years ago including john ritter ben gazarra and audrey hepburn they looked quite wonderful but that was it they were not given any characters or good lines to work with i neither understood or cared what the characters were doing some of the smaller female roles were fine patty henson and colleen camp were quite competent and confident in their small sidekick parts they showed some talent and it is sad they didn t go on to star in more and better films sadly i didn t think dorothy stratten got a chance to act in this her only important film role the film appears to have some fans and i was very open minded when i started watching it i am a big peter bogdanovich fan and i enjoyed his last movie cat s meow and all his early ones from targets to nickleodeon so it really surprised me that i was barely able to keep awake watching this one it is ironic that this movie is about a detective agency where the detectives and clients get romantically involved with each other five years later bogdanovich s ex girlfriend cybil shepherd had a hit television series called moonlighting stealing the story idea from bogdanovich of course there was a great difference in that the series relied on tons of witty dialogue while this tries to make do with slapstick and a few screwball lines bottom line it ain t no paper moon and only a very pale version of what s up doc
a stage company cast finds themselves terrified when a bizarre killer known as the fiend targets them for death a pair of reporters and their clumsy photographer set out to work the story of the fiend and find themselves targets as well just as you think our trio of heroes has the case solved you re thrown another twist that has you wondering who the killer really is according to the dvd sleeve s synopsis taking the hunchback of notre dame to hollywood producer sam katzman s lack of studio settings probably helps a face in the fog look interesting especially toward the end s traffic the direction could be improved upon for example the camera angle on the fight scene is not helpful the budget appears slight under the circumstances most of the silent talkie crossover cast perform it amiably a face in the fog robert f hill lloyd hughes june collyer al st john
i had hoped this movie was going to be mildly entertaining like other sorts of its genre however it was lame and i didn t find myself laughing very much watch it on hbo maybe or if you ve got a free rental to waste and you need a movie to pass the time but i don t recommend paying to see it the plot is simple and straightforward and it could have been funny maybe if the script was better jason lee can be hilarious and he gets a few laughs here and there but the movie falls flat just don t go see this one the directing is lackluster but for what it is directing isn t that important i guess its main drawback is that it is just not very funny see something else don t waste your time here
eight academy nominations it s beyond belief i can only think it was a very bad year even by hollywood standards with huston as director and jack nicholson and kathleen turner as leads i probably would have swallowed the bait and watched this anyway but the oscar nominations really sold it to me and i feel distinctly cheated as a result so it s a black comedy is it can anyone tell me where the humour is in prizzi s honor it s certainly tasteless the shooting in the head of a policeman s wife is but another supposedly comic interlude in this intended farce about mafia life but with the exception of a joke about your favourite mexican cigars which i imagine is an old joke for americans who have been officially forbidden from buying anything cuban for the last years i failed to spot anything of a comic nature and i did try there is a lot of mafia clich but clich doesn t constitute humour in my book is it a romantic comedy of sorts never the characters and their relationships are so completely incredible and shallow that they are on a par with ben afleck and jennifer lopez in gigli is it a cleverly devised parody about the mafia not in a million years the plot is just pointlessly absurd rather than comically absurd and it usually just has the feel of a really bad and cheap mafia movie it feels more like a homage than a parody with one dimensional characters and little in the way of humour written for them the actors are left doing dodgy accents and pulling faces well it isn t enough even when the face is being pulled by that master of the comic facial expression jack nicholson repleat with puffed up top lip now is that meant to be a parody of brando s padded jowls in the godfather oh who cares all i know is it isn t funny throw in some slow plodding direction this film drags on for hours some hopelessly daft and clich d dialogue such as you remember the camora well we re far bigger we ll track you down wherever you go and clich d mannerisms and you ll be reaching for that fast forward button before you can say capiche prizzi s honor is far from being huston s masterpiece and is rather a very poor last work it s definitely one work in the great director s canon that should be given a concrete overcoat and tossed into the hudson river
why does this movie fall well below standards ultimately the answer lies in the poor humourless script a slim average looking travolta looking rather dapper in black i must say even with a huge mullet and gross both act very well as two young ish slick dressed but nevertheless dimwitted new yorkers eager to open their own nightclub other than that the rest of the film is just boring to watch it is so dull that it s really not worth knowing what happens in the film s climax on any level kelly preston obviously exudes sex appeal and the sexually charged dance with her husband to be travolta is one of the film s few pleasures charles martin smith is quite fun to watch as struggling kgb honcho bob smith personally i think the movie would have been better if the plot was altered a little so that the settings did not change from ny to indian springs nebraska which is in the former soviet union you ll understand if you see the movie apparently this movie was filmed in ready for a release i guess paramount stalled on releasing the movie until january because of the unbelievable plot it was reported they deemed it unreleasable nevertheless this film garnered a little over an embarrassing in revenue as it was released only briefly in places like texas and colorado before heading straight to video this is testament to the overall bad quality of this movie
ok let s get right to the point we have five recent college grads must have majored in the f word going out on a weekend camping trip they run into someone who is in need of help but instead of trying to assist him they decide to set him on fire instead nice bunch of people next some of them start go get sick must be something in the water at the cabin they are staying at however the neighbors seem to be ok oh well when things start getting really bad they lock up one their companions instead of getting help try the neighbor by the way some locals don t take a liking to them they chase one on a high speed romp through the woods for many miles until the truck breaks down somehow ten minutes later he shows up at the cabin how he could find it and how he could travel at the speed of light to get there is a mystery another of the brain surgeon type at the cabin realizes something is amiss so he hides out in a cave to let this blow over he then decides the next day to return to the cabin believing it must be some type of shrine he is giddy with relief that he survived he must have thought it was a hour bug unfortuneatley he is met by some not so friendly police officers another couple decide to have sex while the flesh eating bug is working its magic and then the women realizes she needs to shave her legs taking a lot of the diseased skin with shaving cream anyway you get the idea nothing makes sense here these are five people i would not want to be friends with i was rooting for the flesh eating bacteria other characters were introduced who were also somewhat amusing but utterly unlikeable as well ninety minutes of good life wasted here
i really have problems rating this movie it is directed brilliantly there is obviously a lot of money in it gere and danes are intense although her screen personality could use a bit more defining and spicing up editing and cinematography are excellent on the other hand it is one of those really really sick movies where one cannot help but wonder whether the director himself likes to stage specific scenes and yes one cannot help but wonder how many copycats will such a movie inspire in purely artistic terms it is a but i really have to ask myself who these people are giving their money to produce such a movie
i bought this adaptation because i really liked anne bront s novel when i read it some time ago and usually particularly enjoy bbc dramas but i m very disappointed i never thought it would be as bad as that the whole series made me laugh much more than moved me as the novel had first of all the music and songs seems totally out of place in a period drama sounds as if it s been written for a contemporary horror film and like another commentator i was particularly annoyed by the way the cameras spun and spun round the actors i ve seen some scenes filmed that way in north and south and it seemed all right there but in the tenant it s definitely overdone and simply annoying camera movements cannot make wooden acting lively most of the second roles were difficult to distinguish at first and the script lacked clarity none of the characters were properly introduced at first the little boy gave a very good performance he s very cute and the best feature of the film spoilers tara fitzgerald s characterisation of helen graham made her appear cold and harsh letting no emotion pass through she doesn t seem to be able to cry at all in a realistic way i just couldn t believe markham could have fell for her and i m not mentioning the awful hairdo she was given i could not help feeling some sympathy with her husband fancy being married to such a virago besides he was the only main actor that sounded right to me toby stephens i found just ok helen graham s brother not very good maybe it s difficult to adapt a novel that deals with such bleak subjects as alcoholism and cruelty besides what is only hinted at and left to the reader s imagination in the book is dwelt upon with complaisance in the tv adaptation making some scenes both gross and comic like when huntingdon s eye starts bleeding and others far too sexed up for a period drama i mean don t we get enough of those bed scenes in contemporary dramas
i waited almost years to see this movie thinking it might be an underrated work from a period animation was no longer of the quality it had once been it starred one of the best film villains of all time was based on a beloved series of children s books and was a disney studios production what could possibly be wrong with it as it turns outs almost everything well not everything vincent price as rattigan and henry mancini s swanky score are the movie s two saving graces price is wickedly enjoyable and mancini more professional than the material deserves they bring class to a project that otherwise belongs in obscurity meanwhile the rest of the movie while filled with inappropriately adult situations still suffers from a completely dull script blandly generic voice work terrible songs and lazy animation that wouldn t have been out of place on any of disney s mid s saturday morning tv shows this was a complete disappointment to me it s amazing that this movie was nearly contemporary with the secret of nimh costing a fraction of this an independent studio produced something with more creativity in its trailer than gmd has in its endless running time the extra star that keeps this from being awful goes to price and mancini
isabelle huppert is a wonderful actor the director of la pianiste understands this providing the viewer with long takes of huppert s face and these are a pleasure to see huppert is not an animated actor she registers emotion with the smallest lift of an eyebrow or flicker of a smile other than the enjoyment of watching an experienced actor excel in her profession there is nothing in this movie that makes me want to recommend it well if you enjoy self mutilation sado masochism and bizarre behavior la pianiste might work for you other than these attributes i could not find any redeeming value in it buried in all this strange material there is a kernel of truth people who compete at the very highest level musically athletically whatever begin as strange people and are shaped into stranger people by the competitive environment not worth a trip to a movie theater to relearn this life lesson
usually i support independent art and i try to be very comprehensive and tolerant i tend to support everybody because their efforts are worth but this movie just moves away from all comprehension and tolerance limits imagine the following situation think about the really worst horror movie you have ever seen in your life so far think about some great attractive art for that movie s dvd box and a promising plot voil you got zombie nation see it only if you really don t have anything else better to do anything is better
there s plenty to appreciate here spectacular locations and flying sequences period costumes props and sets and competent writing and acting however to enjoy a drama we need at least one principal who exhibits some qualities that we can like or admire in this bunch of catty snobs we found only one character who is at all likable a hapless enlisted man in a fleeting peripheral role as their helpless victim from the reviews here it is clear that we are completely out of step but we did not find their malicious schoolgirl behavior amusing or entertaining even the dog is detestable we threw in the towel after two of the six episodes so you should discount these observations accordingly but what i could find written about this mini series gave us no cause to expect character transformation or redemption
the sign of a classic movie is that it ages like a fine red wine this movie is no cabarnet and certainly no casablanca i agree with the other reviewers that the children in the movie are an unfortunate mutation that now plagues us nightly in sit coms and the dialogue is stilted and preachy but let s look at the obsolete theme of the movie with the passage of sixty plus years of history comes wisdom since watch on the rhine author lillian hellman has been exposed as a bidenesque plagiarist with her so called real life story julia from her book pentimento as one of the most odious of a plethora of western based ussr apologists it is obvious her theme in the play and movie was to stir america to action to save the bloody soviet dictator stalin and international communism from the fascists who had just proved their military superiority in spain as one reviewer correctly noted this is not a pro american play and movie as lillian went to her grave an american loathing communist this film chronicles that familiar smug stupidity of the intellectual elites that made up the american left then just as now the full mooner left of the daily kos and michael moore has bought into the conspiracy theories and once again given aid and comfort to those who would destroy america
one star that s all this documentary deserves i haven t felt this disappointed in watching a movie let alone a documentary in quite some time i m a big fan of the walking with series including it s nigel marvin spin offs for all their gleeful fun yet informative information and although the subject of prehistoric man has never interested me nearly as much as other prehistoric creatures the subject is still interesting and unique to explore having seen all the other docs from the series i figured i need to see this one as well especially after seeing relatively good reviews in other places well for those of you who put up a good review of this doc what were you thinking lol though the information that they were able to get through was interesting the presentation failed in every other way possible it had a terrible flow was incredibly unfocused in what it was trying to say with information scrambled and sometimes out of of place horrible effects that includes the few moments of cgi and especially the makeup effects and overused mtv style camera effects speaking of the makeup effects one reviewer here mentioned how laughable the scene was when the cavemen come across this giant ape and how it looks a lot like a s man in suit horror movie well there are plenty of moments just like that were the people portraying the ape men looked ridiculous and acted ridiculous none of this is helped by horrible camera positions and compositions the worst part of all is none of it is shown in an interesting or dynamic way or looks remotely real it doesn t even look like it was taken seriously it also lacked any emotional punch that the predecessors of the series had remember the episode in walking with dinosaurs of the fate of the ornithochirus sp that episode still gets me on the verge of tears every time i watch it it s this sort of engagement with the subject that lacks here most of all when you are more engaged in the subject and it s own personal story even one that is just speculation you care more about the facts surrounding it the only saving graces of this production are the fairly good narration at least in the bbc version i saw and the music otherwise do not bother even renting this one unless you want to have a good laugh which i did frequently but usually followed by rolling eyes this does not belong on the shelf with the other walking with docs and does it make sense to learn that this doc was not produced or directly involved with the same people who did the others in the series hmmm
parasomnia has an interesting premises but the story is poorly done without any tension or even a logical approach the cast in unconvincing even patrick kilpatrick who played great roles in movies like scanner cop open fire under siege and eraser the rest of the cast is unknown and not very good with the exception of jeffrey combs herbert west from the great re animator trilogy but he can play roles like this in his sleep which is a little what he does here the main problem is that the actions of the characters make no sense at all the story is rather dull and predictable with cheap computer effects mixed with some gory scenes especially at the end this could have been so much better i do not get the good reviews on this one it is below average really
let me be really clear about this movie i didn t watch this movie because of the plot i watch it for the saucy sex scenes that being said this movie is so god damn awful i flip between pure joy of seeing a godly body of traci mandy schaffer and cringing my eyeballs out for the disaster of a plot spoiler alert the first scene of the movie already had me cringing you see a woman painting something by the lakeside in pure bliss and serene then a beautiful girl approach and ask if she could paint beside her when they both finished they show each other what they had done and the woman painted a vineyard when she is facing infront of the lake what kind of screwball director would make this kind of mistake and in another scene traci gets to kill her teacher s lover by smash him with the sail pole and then she swims away and none of the town s police suspected her once i mean hellooooo mandy did not wear a glove did she her finger prints are all over the god damn boat after that it gets worst whenever mandy is around there is the chilling sound effect played which sounds like a cat in hissy fit it s also a real pity rosanna arquette s is in this movie i feel real sorry for her to have to star in this super low budget soft porn no brainer same goes for j rgen prochnow who also has the misfortune to star in this movie all in all
with one of my very favorite actors james spader i expected this film to be at least tolerable it wasn t after the first half hour i watched the rest of it with the remote control in my hand so the fast forward was at the ready so trite so standard one knows what s going to happen in each scene one can even predict the dialogue word for word this is one of those movies that makes one scratch ones head and say how did this movie ever get made in an effort to say something positive i ll add that there are some mildly entertaining special effects but on the whole if you ve seen sci fi movies or you are over years old do yourself a favor and skip this one
i saw this movie on t v this afternoon and i can t see how anyone can sit through this piece of trash it s not funny at all and it takes your i q down a few notches i know this movie is for kids but that doesn t mean the writers should take their intelligence for granted i bet that writers were sitting around a large wooden table and figured that a the word poop equals big laugh b a four foot tall kid can dunk on a ten foot tall basketball net c kids should always fight kidnappers armed with guns because the kidnappers will fall for anything and d months of karate training is all you need to beat up so called ninjas with swords one good thing i can say about this movie is it contains the weakest suburban gang in the world that couldn t scare anybody maybe the guys at mst k could use this movie for a good laugh don t bother with this lame ass excuse for a movie
we expected something great when we went to see this bomb it is basically a broadway play put on film the music is plain terrible there isn t one memorable song in the movie heard any hits from this movie you won t because there aren t any some of the musical numbers go on so long that i got up to go to the restroom and get some pop corn and it was still going when i got back if they were good songs well but they suck the pace is slow terrible character development the lead was praised for her singing but sounded like she screamed every song it was almost impossible to stand this movie has nothing to offer anyone but die hard broadway enthusiasts this is without a doubt the most over rated movie i ve seen in my entire life a complete waist of time and money there is nothing memorable about this movie except danny glover who wasn t on screen enough and whose character wasn t developed enough rent the video and you ll agree this movie was an expensive over produced polished dog do
with the runaway success of god s army every mormon with a camera seems to be trying to make a movie now in the case of the recent the other side of heaven this wasn t at all a bad thing that film while not great was quite good the singles ward however is not telling the story of a young divorced mormon guy thrust back into single life the writing and shooting style of the singles ward is in many ways very similar to the s comedy ferris bueller s day off however the similarities end there while ferris bueller was funny original and well acted as far as stupid comedies like this ever are the singles ward is completely the opposite it tries very hard to be funny however of the gags either fall flat or are cliches and jokes you ve probably heard a million times before the other seem to be thrown in to fill out the time and the acting while not awful is amaturish at best in addition if you re not either a mormon yourself or very very familiar with mormon culture you won t get hardly anything at all whereas god s army and the other side of heaven were appealing to a broad range of viewers both inside and outside of the mormon church this film is most definitely one big inside joke and even if you get it it s just not that funny
i sat through this movie this evening forcing myself to stick with it even though i never cared about any of the characters or what happened to them because the two leads g rard philippe and mich le morgan were major film stars of their era and i wanted to see them in something different which this certainly was they both gave fine performances but of distasteful characters indeed the whole movie is about a shabby little town in mexico inhabited by almost uniformly distasteful characters the doctor is of course the major exception what mich le morgan ever sees in philippe to fall in love with him is never explained this is supposedly based on a work by jean paul sartre all i could think was that if sartre s work is anything like this movie it must be a very mediocre attempt at imitating camus masterful novel the plague which dealt with a plague in north africa a well acted but uninteresting movie
i saw this movie on the film festival of rotterdam jan and followed the discussion between director and public afterwards many people reacted shocked and protesting he will get a lot of negative critics but the world is cruel like this and it s not funny people don t like it that itself doesn t mean that the movie is bad i can see that difference don t shoot the messenger that shows us the world outside our hubble nevertheless i think this a bad movie film technically it s a good one nice shots and script most good fitting music great actors the director pretends to make a psychological movie the psychology however is of poor quality describing such a powerful violence itself is not the art the art would be a powerful description of the psychological process behind that violence how does a shy boy come to such a cruelty the director pretends to describe that but is not good in that the director used several times the word the selfishness of people mentioning for instance the teacher only this teacher wasn t selfish just someone in several roles caring for his pupils nd worried about his script i think it s a simplification to call him selfish the atmosphere in the village is creepy and the mother made awful mistakes you terribly let me down but it doesn t become believable for me that there is caused s ch a lot of pain that the shyest boy comes to such terrible things in fact reality is far more complex than the way this film describes and it needs far better descriptions the interesting thing would be how does it work describe that process for me please so that we understand with the written phrase on the end the director said to point to an alternative way of life it was the other extreme and confirmed for me that director and scriptwriter are bad psychologists promoting black white thinking the connection between violence in films and in society has been proved use such a violence gives the responsibility to use it right there are enough black white thinkers in the world causing lots of war and misery i hope this movie won t be successful
this film might have weak production values but that is also what makes it so good the special effects are gross out and well done my favorite part of the movie had to be chrissy played by janelle brady she is super hot and also has a good nude scene robert prichard as the leader of the gang is hilarious as are the other members this film is actually trying to make a point by saying that nuclear waste plants are bad fair comedy gross out film
what a horrible movie i cannot believe i wasted mins of my life watching this re make please tell me why ving rhames and mehki pfifer starred in this film mehki pfifer is great in e r and ving rhames probably didn t know what he was doing i feel terrible for them the music background i must say did not fit at alllll with the story and it s amazing how you can find these directors who have absolutely no lives in creating a well and balanced film i hope that in the future no director as horrible as this one was could ever distroy such a great classic film this film should not have been made in the first place an advice to everyone who has seen it please tell me that i m right because i couldn t possibly be the only viewer who did not enjoy it boooooo out of
i wonder how much this movie actually has got to do with the movie bachelor party starring tom hanks is this movie even an official sequel this movie is lacking in every department and you re obviously better off not watching it for a comedy this movie simply isn t good or funny enough it relies mostly on the character s their stereotypical assessments rather then the movie actually features some good original and funny moments of course there also is very little story present and the movie nude breast than script pages you just keep waiting for things to finally start off there is a main plot line in it somewhere but that one is so terribly unoriginal and gets executed so poorly in the movie that it feels more as if it s something non existent i guess there even is a message and moral story in it somewhere but this again is so terribly unoriginal and poorly done in the movie that it simply does not work out it s basically a typical teenage comedy with lots of sex jokes and nudity only without the teenage main characters which makes the story all the more sad and tasteless the movie makes some really wrong jokes that are misplaced for any type of movie i regret ever watching this
c mon guys some previous reviewers have nearly written a novel commenting on this episode it s just an old s tv show this episode of star trek is notable because of the most serious babe yeoman barrow s ever used on star trek and the fact that it was filmed in a real outdoor location unlike the tng and voyager series which were totally confined to sound stages this use of an outdoor location and babe gives proper depth and an almost film like quality to a quite ordinary episode of this now dated and very familiar show except a few notable exceptions i e the city on the edge of forever assignment earth and tomorrow is yesterday the old series of star trek needs to be seriously moth balled and put out of it s boring misery half a dozen good episodes from is quite a poor batting average this is typical of the boring stuff gene roddenberry produced back then actually contrary to popular belief where some people worshiped the ground he walked on he actually made a lot of rubbish he doesn t deserve to be spoken of in the same breath as irwin allen for example just look at the set of the bridge of the enterprise from a modern point of view they used wobbly plywood for the floor cafeteria chairs with plastic backs and cheap cardboard above the instrument panels you can clearly see the folds in the paper every expense spared or what
in s o paulo the upper middle class teenagers cristiano chico and gabriel have just joined the university and on the eve of the opening class they go to a party with drugs and booze on the next day after their classes the date of cristiano in the previous night comes to his house and the three friends rape the girl the girl dies they panic and decide to get rid off the body but cristiano s mother arrives startles with gabriel and rolls the staircase breaking her neck the trio decides to dump and burn the corpses in a garbage landfill but along the night other tragedies happen the polemic and shameful cama de gato is an overrated pretentious crap about alienation of the youth and is certainly the worst brazilian movie that i have seen along many years the shallow tragic and dark story is actually a black humor comedy of bad taste the screenplay is not funny with stupid lines and dialogs and boring manipulative and silly footages with interviews with morons teenagers in the beginning and in the end the acting is terrible apparently with many improvisations but no talent and i was disappointed with presence of the promising caio blat in this trash the camera framing cinematography and edition are amateurish and of very low quality the sound is awful and in many parts it is impossible to understand what the actors and actresses are speaking probably it is a plus since this flick sucks the gang bang is very realistic and used to promote this mediocre movie in a very poor marketing of sex exploitation my vote is one awful title brazil cama de gato bed of the cat
as a physics student i ve become aware of many idiot professors and other so called experts in the field as i continue with my studies i learn more and more about real physics experiments going on and about the people who are doing things right then my friends tell me of this physics movie they want to see knowing nothing of it i m excited hoping that the information will be presented well i ve done real quantum mechanics this wasn t it this movie starts with the basic assumption that anything that occurs to a subatomic particle can and will occur to you if you just open your eyes let s think about that for just a moment our bodies are composed of somewhere around such subatomic particles that is a million billion billion billion particles the more mysterious quantum effects of just two particles can have a probability of cancelling each other out completely as you add more and more particles into the mix it becomes almost impossible to have a large net quantum result to tell us to believe that this is a valid assumption with no rationality behind it it s just stupid my friend also in physics and i counted facts during the course of this movie but they were presented in the most misleading manner i ve ever seen i cannot say as much for the neural portion of the movie as i have not had any kind of medical training it seemed as though it might have had a slight bit more truth to it remembering my days in biology but i cannot say at least this film had a redeeming quality the dancing peptides or whatever they actually were scene not to ruin the invaluable plot that drives this movie but the main character goes to a wedding where she sees all different types of personalities driven by their peptides and then the film cuts to the dance floor where we are spliced between people dancing sometimes surrounded by cg peptides and a fully cg scene filled with dancing peptides the film at that point was trying to tell us how we re addicted to emotions so we re treated to the full song of that smash hit addicted to love this scene was redeeming because anyone who could go through that scene and still take this movie seriously well you are the ones that need to open your eyes
i used to review videos for joe bob briggs legendary we are the weird newsletter i saw a lot of stinkers but this by far was the worst and the years have not been kind it remains the most indecent crime against cinema i have ever witnessed don t get me wrong caged terror is nominally more technically competent than say monster a go go or the guy from harlem or something of that ilk what solidifies its claim as worst movie of all time for me is its unique blend of bare proficiency with crippling pretension is it a vietnam commentary an ecological protest an incitement to race riot a study of man s inhumanity to man a novel exercise in padding nature footage out to nearly feature length in short a hep young urban professional possibly the most loathesome screen character ever somehow seduces a nubile asian american associate into camping in the woods with him after brow beating her with quasi philosophical clap for the better part of an hour they run across two wandering veterans the unforgettable jarvis a righteous brother and the troubadour guitar toting manson family reject hey a plot twist tension action suspense well no just a climactic getting locked in a makeshift wire chicken coop and lightly belittled scene the victim in question stares listlessly at the captors and mutters no no please don t meanwhile jarvis addresses the troubadour as trouby once every two minutes bringing to mind nothing so much as the alien star of juan picquer s pod people that s about all that happens in caged terror and such a synopsis perhaps makes it seem almost tolerable but trust me i ve seen thousands of movies in my life and this one has remained for the past eight years since i first saw it the absolute worst i pop it in the old vcr once every two years or so just to reassure myself and reassure myself i certainly do i think the element which makes caged terror so particularly hateful is this very little happens and although what little does happen happens quite poorly and quite slowly what truly makes it compulsively unwatchable is the suffocating sense that the filmmakers really really want to shove some kind of message down your throat but because caged terror is so incompetent and ineffectual what was intended as a civics lesson becomes a crash course in intense viewing discomfort this film is minutes long and feels like three and a half hours it s terrible truly truly terrible folks trust me i saw ghosts that still walk and this one is worse go see it you ll thank me and curse me just for the record my favorite line in caged terror but perhaps ever yeah well you probably think the song of solomon was an allegory for christ s love for the church note must be delivered in a tone of concerted condecension
this film once sensational for its forward thinking politics and depictions of free love and sexual liberation has been reduced by time to a mere curiosity it seems absurd now that this mostly boring little film had been banned and seized by governments in many countries given how socialistic sweden eventually became the radicalism of its politics once controversial appear naive and almost mainstream four decades later and its sex scenes at one time the subject of sensational obscenity trials look pretty tame in a modern context nevertheless the film and accompanying documentaries detailing its many controversies and influences remains marginally watchable as an early reliquary of s youth rebellion one part of the film that still holds up its self consciousness with respect to the fourth wall every once in a while the filmmakers film themselves making the film the satiric playfulness of this still elicits a chuckle
malcolm mcdowell has not had too many good movies lately and this is no different especially designed for people who like yellow filters on their movies
after watching this i had lost a little respect for christopher lee this has passed over time this film was utter garbage first they tried to recreate the ending from the first howling with incredibly bad make up then they try to turn it into a sad excuse of a werewolf porn film the plot sucks and the whole film is just awful a brother of a werewolf victim from the first film from the look of it it was supposed to be dee wallace stone teams up with lee and another woman to destroy the group of werewolves lead by sybil danning who seems to be naked all the time this is not even worth renting unless you want to waste your time and money watching the nudity try to catch it on cable instead it would be so chopped up it may actually make sense
this movie delivers the best is when the awkward teenage neighbor tries to bike away from the babysitter and in the background looks like he s never been anywhere near a bike in his life as he attempts not to fall off but this movie doesn t stop there when less than minutes later it delivers a scene of nothing but an arm reaching through a fence and into a cooler pulling out a beer stereotypical grilling dads several plot lines that go nowhere and a former seaquest actress with a bluetooth cell phone all add up to making this the perfect saturday night at home
with goldie hawn and peter sellers in a movie you figure this one won t go wrong but what can i say this was a horrible misfire the movie is about peter sellers as an older gentleman who suddenly finds himself in a relationship with a really strange young not to mention attractive hippie in goldie hawn the movie is incredibly disjointed and i did not understand anything about it peter sellers and goldie hawn are very funny people but this movie does not prove it that song about arabella cinderella is pretty cool but that is it i only recommend this movie to people that like to watch an extreme novelty movie this is almost the definition of one i guess this movie more than anything else is a sign of the times in terms of it s definite experimentalism and all around unconventionality the problem is the quality is completely shot and the writing not to mention the direction is just so out there peter sellers in particular is very hit and miss he will go from dr strangelove and being there throughout his career to dumb movies like this and the magic christian which was very similar to this one in context and style but that movie did have a few funny moments this one is senseless and i am sad that someone as great as peter sellers was in this movie not recommended for anyone
i chose this movie by the cover which was a bad move it wasn t funny at all and the main characters were obnoxious the girl was beautiful but the story and the acting were terrible it had absolutely nothing to do with surfing terrible movie with a surf theme that had nothing to do with surfing and no real surfers catherine zeta jones was beautiful and the movie will probably see a resurgence just becuase she is in the limelight now being married with gordon gekko and all but if you haven t seen it don t waste your time a bad movie with great surfing real surfers and amazing beautiful cinematography was in god s hands
ok so chuck norris somehow found a way to get this sequel produced i have one question why who read this script and said sound s great original this movie is regurgitated crap that i wouldn t tarnish my toilet bowel with of course it is another story following in the tradition of mia invasion usa walker texas ranger delta force and so on in which chuck norris of course is the one man who can same america from some bad guys he doesn t even need a gun most times it s stupid patriotic jargon that stales the mind big surprise that the only one who will direct these norris film s is chuck s son eric eric norris has primarily worked on all his father s films and tv shows doesn t this strike anyone as a sign that he has no directing talent afterall he s directing the same people as before in the same stories as before only difference is the characters names if this is supposed to make me patriotic and cheer for the usa than our country is in much worse shape than i ever imagined hopefully this will be the nail in chuck norris s acting coffin
i fell asleep on my couch at pm last night watching larry sanders i usually directivo it but not last night woke up at am invesment banker on the west coast and was fascinated to see this on hbo i was shocked on how poor this movie was seriously shocked so shocked that i had to write a commentary on imdb this is really really bad the writing is boring but the directing and editing are simply below those of a freshman at a film school yes it is shot video mind you that is shot on video not digital video it does look like a soap opera the clips from skateboard videos have a more film feel to them then this horror i wanted to describe the poor directing but i honestly cant remember anything the shots and blocking are stupid yes i chose the word stupid not unconventional not daring not bold not boring just stupid i know people reviewing this review will say well give me an example i cant it was am but trust me i know you will watch it anyway you will be drawn by the horrible reviews
i have always been interested in anything about bigfoot so when i was browsing around looking for a movie to rent this one caught my eye it was the worst i ve ever spent and i want my money back please don t waste your money on this this was one of the cheapest movies i ve ever seen the entire movie was so incredibly boring and i found myself rolling my eyes a lot and i didn t even watch it all the way through i just got fed up with it the acting was horrible the effects were horrible everything was just really bad and tasteless it all added up to be a really bad boring movie and total waste of time and money i hope that one day they ll make a good movie about sasquatch but until then i ll have to sit through countless cheap duds like this one to find the real masterpiece
omen iv was a bad made for t v movie since the s were over i guess the executives were experimenting in meth the drug of choice during the s because there is no other reason to explain this travesty why did they even bother making this a t v movie what were they mulling over when this one came up on the idea board did they even think for a second that this movie would catch on as perhaps they thought it could make it as a series we ll never know but i know one thing this movie was the major reason why i never bought the omen trilogy they should have knocked off a couple of bucks instead of putting out this extra disc omen iv is basically a average american family remake of the first film instead of a snot nosed punk kid we get the spooky girl who s a total brat to everyone around her if the family had stronger parenting skills then none of the demonic events that have transpired in the past films would have never occurred these parents need to put their foot down and do some real discipline not recommended best to avoid at all cost
normally i don t like revenge films period but double impact has a little more than your typical revenge plot premise you see di has action accuracy exotic locales i e hong kong awesome gun battles and enough martial arts to satisfy your cravings for impressive unarmed combat like all revenge flicks it has villains you d love to throw out of a plate glass window on the top floor of a story building however double impact has none of the sensationalist crap that suffocates the plot and the elitist racist and venomous social stereotypes that invaded eye for an eye and death wish but in the plot department double impact is as transparent as saran wrap chad and alex s parents were killed by a mob hit squad connected to a family friend with money problems or at least that s what i remembered the explanation of why the boys were talking in french accents is a lousy one it wasn t the watery plot that made this movie bad but the use of clich d lines and moves from other movies from lethal weapon to the princess bride really made it worse but nonetheless double impact is still watchable but why is that shitty movies like this have villains for example that greedy british guy that killed chad and alex s parents and that lethal lesbian redhead chick you would love to hate with fiber of your being
this movie is little more than poorly made fetish porn and this is saying a lot considering the similar crap that was made in that era this was recommended to me by friend as a unique film experience he was right i suppose he meant that as a joke not disgusting not even that shocking just mediocre acting and poor attempts at shock art a little bit of camp value though i don t believe the makers of this film intended this and yes as a previous reviewer mentioned it s sex with a guy in a bear suit don t spend a lot of money on this try to borrow it if you must see it or contact me i d be happy to sell you my copy for half price i may have to see another of this particular director s films as he seems to have a certain following but if it s anything like this i will again regret another hours of my life gone forever
spoilers a bit ridicules made for tv movie has sexy and middle age gold digger isabelle collins susan tucci doing a number on every man she comes in contact with in the movie first winning over their hearts then their wallets and then when their no longer any use to her thrown in the wastepaper basket like a used up kleenex tissue isabelle s first victim is non other then her abusive on keeping isabelle from raiding his bank account husband stewart john o hurley it s later in the movie when isabelle gets very friendly with former plumber and now yacht salesman richard davis philip casnoff that she without really telling him has the totally love sick richard get a contract out on her unsuspecting husbands life getting this ex convict in fact as soon as he s released from prison daggett nicholas campbell to do the job on stewart richard soon finds out that he didn t get exactly what he paid in cash for getting a little too greedy daggett not only blew stewart s brains out but took a solid gold watch that stewart offered him in order to spear his life as well the watch was easily traced to daggett as he tried to pawn it at a local jewelry shop where he was quickly arrested with doggett spilling his guts out on who hired him to whack stewart it doesn t take long for the long arm of the law to arrest stewart s by hiring doggett killer isabelle s husband to be ex plumber and yacht salesman richard davis davis arrest by the police happens just as he and isabelle took the vows of matrimony in a local church isabelle manipulates everyone exclusively men that fall head over heels for her to her advantage by getting them to do her dirty work always playing the part of the naive housewife or widow or lover or even client isabelle seems to live a charmed life always one step ahead of the law and police no matter what she does isabelle covers her pretty behind so well that it s almost impossible to pin her down on any in having others do them of the many crimes that she commits through a second party in the film after screwing figuratively as well as literally her first husband steven her second husband for less then ten seconds richard and finally her or richard s attorney gavin kendrick kamar de los rey isabelle knows that it s only a matter of time before the police get wise to her with the d a getting both richard and kendrick to turn evidence against her isabelle now knowing that everything is fast closing in on her makes her final move getting everything in order by transferring all her cash overseas isabelle and her year old daughter ruby lauren collins shoot down to the passport office in order to get clearance passports to get out of the country it s then when the cagey and clever isabelle makes her first and possibly last and fatal mistake in the movie isabelle is told by the passport clerk don carrier she ll have to wait a full hours for her and ruby s passport to clear just enough time for the police to find and arrest her outlandish ending that goes against almost everything and every ethic that s in a film noir or crime movie an ending that will not only blow your mind but your concept of what s right and wrong in the world
i wrote a review of this movie further down after buying it on dvd and being sorely disapointed i tried watching it again after reading a few of the comments made since then being a film student and making similar budgeted movies myself ie no budget shot on digi cam i stand by my original comments this is a no budget student project and not a particularly good one released on video dvd to look like an award winning film if you read the cover so deceving the public into thinking it s something it s not i want my money back under the trades description act complete rubbish
this movie is a cringe fest of bad acting and poor set design as well as tacky lines and a lame plot but it is so much fun to watch everything about it is hilarious the basic plot is a group of scientists from the future travel back in time to capture their evil co worker who is intent on destroying them all they catch up with him in the year the futuristic lab of the scientists from the year is an eighties style room with a bunch of futuristic flashing buttons and a time capsule that looks like a lawn shed the actors deliver their lines with unenthusiastic aplomb which isn t hard to understand considering that the lines are usually earth shakers like i double checked everything twice he double checked everything twice he checked it four times not only that but they feed you the entire premise of the movie in the first five minutes and continue at a rapid fire pace until they hit the medieval part when roger corman ran out of money and had to stop travelling through time and consequently different sets the medieval set is a comic mish mash of anything from the late th century to the th century any costume they could find they used i guess chain mail wasn t on the budget cause the guys all wear sequined shirts masquerading as armor the fight scenes are laughable with men casually throwing themselves onto cardboard swords with abandon and dying in death throws with nary a blow cast it sounds truly awful but i enjoy it every time i watch it the lines alone are enough to have you in fits and everything else pulls together to create a fabulous b movie that if you are a connoisseur of corny flicks i would suggest you see and once you have read the review on unknown movies i love hearing them point out all the funny truly awful bits in the movie
this film was slow but tedious and the acting often drifted into the land of ham redgrave s character was unappealing as the something woman trying to compete with thurman s something for the love of fox s character why is beyond me the title of the movie should have been shallow people on the lake the actors played like they were in a rehearsal a dreadfully predictable ending to boot i can t believe this is on this website as a comedy
this was a quite brutal movie there were huge implausibilities and a silly script bad acting etc the only reason to watch this movie is that from time to time some quite impressive sets of breasts were exposed
oh boy where do i go with this one herendous acting weak plot stupid deaths pointless nudity this isn t entertainment this is hell hell don t waste your money time or life on this pit of evil it s just god damn is this movie awful tom savini why why would you waste your life on this crap this movie not worth it i d rather snort crack and smash my head up against a wall than watch this this sinful act again please take my advice and stay the f k away from this elephant turd of a film no you know what i shouldn t even have to call this thing a film just stay away
it s a good movie if you plan to watch lots of landscapes and animals like an animal documentary and making pierce brosnan an indian make you wonder does all those people don t recognize if someone isn t indian at plain sight
i saw most of the episodes of rmftm as a teenager on cliffhanger theater running after midnight on a local station some years ago and then again when mystery science theatre riffed on it in the early s time has not been kind to it i can certainly make allowances for the special effects which were quite impressive for a low budget s serial imo commando cody s flying scenes were better than george reeves superman s in his tv show and i can also make allowances for the ahem acting and fight choreography except for the guy who plays the ruler of the moon men he is incredibly miscast he looks and acts like the fellow who comes to fix your plumbing not the despotic ruler of an alien race even the corny dialog works all right everyone rattles off their lines like strings of firecrackers with no wasted time or pauses for things like thought or introspection since everyone does this the viewer finds it immersive after awhile and even to my modern sensibilities it doesn t bother much what really irritates me is the writing and the plotting i m not talking about the sunny weather on the moon or baking soda powered rocket ships or a flying suit that has controls labeled up down and fast slow i m not even bothered by the cheesiness of the resolutions to the cliffhangers that end each chapter i m talking about the fact that our supposed heroes are dumber than fence posts and have no cumulative memory and by the fact that although that the dialog clips along like an express train the plot goes through the same motions again and again dig it commando cody and his pal are the spearhead of a top secret hi tech science lab charged with protecting earth or at least the usa against an insidious alien invasion but his office has no guards or security checkpoints they don t even have locks on the front doors so the bad guys walk right in and beat the crap out of the cody and his staff not once perhaps understandable but several times they even kidnap his female assistant on the second try and they never get any smarter to further prove my point allow me to point out the way that cody jumps in his flying suit and flies around getting into trouble and never actually seems to succeed in catching anyone he does this over and over and over cody also flies his ship to the moon the woman assistant comes along to cook stays for about seconds and immediately turns around and comes back cody captures one of the atomic ray guns and immediately loses it again to the bad guys because he couldn t be bothered to lock it up and so on and you would think that if cody s efforts were so vital to saving the usa from the moon men that he might ask for a few soldiers with carbines a few helicopters and a tank or two to back him up instead of just working with the local police all the time this was supposed to be a military operation but they act like it s another episode of gangbusters it s all rather hard to stomach i appreciate that the creators were severely limited in the scope of their story by budget and time constraints and i appreciate that cody is actually a reasonably tough hombre even though he loses half of his fistfights but i just can t help yelling door lock the doooor when the gangsters simply walk into his lab or try to blow up the ship and there are no security measures at the landing site in place not even a fence still it s ok of the three republic serials i ve watched phantom creeps had a better plot and undersea kingdom had more atmosphere hah and a better hero than radar men but it s an ok time waster btw why radar men they didn t use radar they used atomic ray guns shouldn t the title have been atomic ray gun men from the moon

i hate this movie it is a horrid movie sean young s character is completely unsympathetic her performance is wooden at best the storyline is completely predictable and completely uninteresting i would never recommend this film to anyone it is one of the worst movies i have ever had the misfortune to see
nat voiced by trevor gagnon along with his brainiac friend iq voiced by philip bolden and the always hungry scooter david gore are kids with big dreams they want to be the first flies in space and what encourages their dreams is the first spacecraft to land on the moon the apollo is waiting for its historic trip on the launch pad near where the three hang out the first thing you notice is the animation of the film i found it done very well done the scenery had depth to it as things in the distance actually looked like they were behind the focus of the scenes i didn t see the movie in d as it was broadcast on hbo however i could see that there really wasn t any scenes which took advantage of the d effects except a fight between characters near the end i also wasn t really impressed with the design of the characters to me they didn t look like anything resembling a fly especially in the coloring the flies were an unusual blue gray that was kind of distracting to me the performances from the cast was not bad but it wasn t good either there were many times i focused more on my computer than the story the writing was certainly written for a younger audience with comedic moments that will make younger kids laugh i saw nothing for adults like jokes that they ll get the punchline for the adults to understand the meaning history was not followed in this film in fact i think it was completely ignored as the main focus was the flies i also hated when a well known astronaut popped up on the screen and explained that the stories about the flies in the film was a work of fiction and no flies were on apollo i did like how he thanked the men and women who sacrificed their lives for space exploration though if you are an adult this is not for you it was not made for the entire family this is certainly just for kids but save this one for a rainy day
this is only a response to the yahoo who says this movie is more realistic than the classic genre defining masterpiece jaws yes brainiac great whites and other species of shark bull black tip oceanic white tip tiger have been known to populate areas where easy prey is found humans don t often make it onto that menu granted but the shark in the film was repeatedly pointed out to be exhibiting abnormal behavior it s not like it s never happened the odds of a killer whale destroying nearly a whole town singling out a human nemesis sinking several dozen thick hulled north atlantic fishing boats and knowing when certain people all friends of the aforementioned nemesis are close enough to the water for it to reach are so slim as to be laughable much like this turd of a jaws knock off laughable great white sharks are also known to frequently chew on boats protective underwater cages and people on rafts and surfboards as they look like seals from below a shark the size of bruce if you don t know look it up would be more than capable of sinking a boat like the orca hey that s the name of the blatant rip off we re discussing as it would weigh upwards of lbs i could go on but i don t need to jaws is amazing better acting better effects better music better writing orca is crap blatant rip off of jaws lousy writing abominable effects most ridiculous plot this side of an olson twins flick it doesn t take a masters from columbia university to see that watch better movies
the original movie dated did not show any monster it just suggested scary things this version however shows every aspect of a sick minded ghost including unnecessary special effects the mystery as presented in the original movie was the most scary part one simply did not know what was causing the weird things that happened by showing the face of the old man this mister has completely disappeared even worse the special effects crying wooden children faces is ridiculous this is a stupid remake too obviously spectacular to even be close as scary as the original
let me be clear i ve used imdb for years but only today i went through the trouble of registering on the site just so i could give this movie the lowest possible rating i ve seen hundreds of films some of them bad a few awful never though have i seen such a contrast of pretense and incompetence of high intentions and failure mira sorvino is horribly cast as the princess but entirely unbelievable as phocion a young boy fiona shaw is always an entertaining character but the dialogue in the film is much worse even than in the insipid french play that is the source marivaux never reached hollywood until now and we should keep it that way to illustrate for example that leontine is a brilliant passionate philosopher and scientist she is shown frantically pouring chemicals from beaker to beaker shouting out names of famous scientists and the romance between agis and the princess is played even sillier for this the pair should receive a joint clair danes award which in a just world would be awarded for gratuitously anachronistic and uninspired re interpretation of interesting teens from literature as brats of the s see miss danes in les miserables aside from the atrocious plot and dialogue there are some attempts to introduce artistic tropes into the filming for example there are moments when a handful of spectators are faded in and out of view of the action sitting in chairs watching the principal characters the director wants us to realize she s adapted a play i get it but it doesn t happen at all until far into the film at that point seeing a crowd of people sitting in chairs for a moment then disappearing is creepy and distracting they re like some sort of un scary zombie crowd appearing through the mists filling us with dread when you see the horrible frolic and song that ends this movie you ll want to rouse your own crowd of zombies and kill them all for the grave injustise of poisoning your mind for minutes matthew mcguire
about twenty minutes into this movie i was already bored quite simply these characters were fairly dull occasionally something enjoyable would happen but then things would slow down again fortunately my patience was eventually rewarded and the ending to this movie wasn t bad at all however it was by no means good enough to justify sitting through the first ninety minutes so i would say that the movie was mediocre overall and considering all of the talent in the cast i d call this a disappointment
universal soldier the return is not the worst movie ever made no that honor would have to go to a film that attempted to make some sort of statement or accomplish some artistic feat but failed in a pathetic or offensive manner however perhaps no movie i have ever seen has tried for so little and succeeded so completely as did universal soldier the return this film is a sci fi action travesty that has virtually nothing to recommend it the acting is as bad as any movie i ve ever seen the plot is terrible and predictable the special effects are pathetic in short anyone even remotely connected to this film should be ashamed of themselves us the return makes previous van damme fare seem like groundbreaking cinematic masterpieces some movies are so bad they re good believe me when i tell you that this is not one of them i m really not sure what else to say here i doubt many people were considering seeing this movie if they hadn t already but just in case don t
although i had some hopes for this film particularly since i enjoy the acting of jason segel freaks geeks undeclared so much i must say it was one of the worst films i ve seen in recent memory loser and dr t and the women are also on that list yes there were a couple of laugh out loud moments although the movie could have been so much better the premise was not bad scam artists cheating their way through college meet their match when they re discovered by someone with a proposition for them the problem is that the characters were all so unlikable that i didn t care about any of them the blackmailer played by talented jason schwartzman was such a psychopath that it wasn t that funny to watch him he wasn t deranged in a particularly funny or charming way he was just a crazy loser who was actually rather dangerous and not fun to watch the editing of the movie was hard to follow it kept cutting between fantasy and reality and it was often unclear which was which only two or three of the gang s scams were really shown you just had to take it on faith that they were indeed scam artists showing their schemes would have made for a better movie the so called love story was absurd and unbelievable in fact it was silly and poorly written and directed throughout i could go on about the movie s shortcomings but you get the idea not worth the rental or the gas it takes to drive to and from the movie store to rent
i admire kissing on the mouth for its frankness pubic hair cutting and masturbation especially from the lead director joe swanberg they weren t afraid to show trueness to everyday private occurrences unfortunately the film falls under the the brown bunny realm though with a slightly more developed plot of jealousy yes it mirrors bunny with a whole lot of nothing going on or too many cinematography shots focused or sincerely unfocused on absolutely nothing feet hands or genitals again unfortunately i can see why this film was released and why people are renting true life sex scenes and full frontal equally both male and female nudity other than that it was a complete waste of time we quickly learn of a post college male female roommate pair in which the male has obvious feelings for the female that sees him as just a friend while continuously having sex with her ex boyfriend other than that we are subjected to the every day events of their boring lives she works for her parents he works on an extremely uninteresting sexual awareness project on his computer for this all to work the dialogue has to be interesting and the acting real neither work and it s as boring as watching someone drive for an hour i e the brown bunny the only actor that stands out is kate winterich and even she does some questionable acting the dvd extra with her in front of a mike is actually worth watching listening to again i admire the filmmakers especially swanberg for baring it all and not being afraid to expose themselves or shower habits but overall the film falls flat it has narrations that doesn t fit the scenes too many boring everyday events and unconvincing acting that you wonder other than the soft porn factor why you rented this
i just watched the incredible melting man for the second time and it was even more boring than when i first watched it i don t understand why it has become such a cult classic when it is so tediously dull the opening scene looks promising when the fat nurse drops the canister of blood and runs for her dear life after this all that really happens is the melting man stalks around some woods and houses whilst having flashbacks of his life as an astronaut the makeup is quite good and his melting gooey face looks fairly realistic there is a cool scene where he throws a mans head in a river and it floats until it reaches a waterfall where it falls on rocks and bursts open there s not much to wet yourself over though most scenes are shot in darkness and you can t really see what is happening there isn t much gore at least in the vipco dvd i watched no the incredible melting man is not that great at all i ll give it marks for its cheese factor but that s about it if you want a true sci fi horror cult classic watch the deadly spawn instead
i do agree that though this story by melville just might be unfilmable this isn t even a credible try to move the story into the th century just outrages the original story s intent and nature possibly you might have been able to move it over to england but it must be a period piece even our story narrator the proprietor tells it in a flashback going back even further somewhere around towards the end of the th century a strangely disobedient worker would be discarded without a thought and the th century come on give me an expletive deleted break even around such behavior didn t work very well in view of the ending and the movie s ending i don t know what it was because i didn t watch the entire travesty i had to stop this was like setting streetcar named desire in elizabethan england
what was this supposed to be a remake of fisher king why do we care about sandler s character what a slow dreary boring who gives a damn about these people movie just simply painful to sit through i turned it off before it was over it s so obvious that cheadle needs help as much as sandler like i said can you say fisher king and how does this psychotic character function in his daily life we aren t supposed to think that deeply i guess why does cheadle continue to give sandler a chance to turn violent on him if they were such good friends how did they grow apart if cheadle is so in control why does he keep seeking the advice of the shrink on the street we are never told that s why fisher king was a better film on so many levels and why this just sucks nearly out of average score i don t agree at all even the top films are lucky to get such a high average rating and this crap doesn t deserve to be in the same universe with them
so the wife and i just finished it despite several threats from both of us to turn it off for the most part boredom was the worst part of this movie there was just very little excitement the acting was atrocious to the point where we actually chuckled several times during some of the worse scenes the church lady for example the dead sister was using paranormal means to contact her living twin although rather then send useful information she focused on trying to scare the hell out of her instead which looked a lot like the ring rather then get the police involved which i m sure those earplugs she found would have dna all over them she instead devises a horrible plan to get the man who covered up the accidental death of her sister i call it a horrible plan because in the end she allows him to kill her too which the movie then fades to black bad dialog bad acting bad ending
there s so little here of the fantastic anne rice book that what is here makes no sense some of the characters intense and surprising characters don t make it to the screen at all and those who do are watered down to the point that there s no reason for their existence where s the relationship between christophe and marcel where s the continued affair between marcel and juliet why does dolly rose appear at all since her story s never explained where s the rape and redemption of marie whose greatest attribute and downfall is that she can pass for white and her marriage to richard why does the film end with marcel s beating at the hands of his father we learn nothing of aglae beyond that she s a bitch who hates her husband why no backstory explaining this hatred as for the performances there s not a one that s better than mediocre though that s likely due to the lousy script best of the lot is that of the actor playing richard but richard s not on screen enough to salvage the film worst is jasmine guy as dolly rose though again it comes down to the actress having nothing to do with what little she s given to work with all in all this is just terrible i thought it d be impossible for any anne rice book turned film to be worse than exit to eden but feast of all saints makes that mess look like a critical hit how is it that rice is such a slut she ll allow her best works to become such junk on the screen
spielberg loves the smell of sentiment in the morning but sentiment at the expense of narrative honesty nobody should love that lucius shepard the color purple takes place in the deep south during the early s and tells the story of celie and nettie two african american sisters the film opens with the girls playing in a field of purple flowers an idyllic haven which is promptly shattered by the appearance of their stepfather this motif innocence interrupted by men permeates the entire film the film then launches into a series of short sequences celie is revealed to have been twice impregnated by her stepfather gives birth in a dirty barn has her newborn child taken away and is forced to marry a local widow named albert johnson a violent oaf who rapes her repeatedly forcing her to cook clean and look after his children all these horrific scenes are given little screen time and are instead surrounded by moments of pixie dust cinematography a meddlesome symphonic score incongruous comedy and overly exuberant camera work the cumulative effect is like the merging of a disney cartoon and a rape movie a jarring aesthetic which caused stanley kubrick to remark that the color purple made him so nauseated that he had to turn it off after ten minutes ten minutes he lasted a long time the film is often said to deal which racism sexism and black culture but this is not true alice walker the author of the novel upon which the film is based claims to be a bisexual but is actually a closet lesbian her book is a lesbian fantasy a story of female liberation and self discovery which paints men as violent brutes who stymie women for walker the only way out of this maze is for women to bond together in a kind of lesbian utopia black sisterhood and female independence celebrated spielberg s film however re frames walker s story through the lens of comforting american mythologies this is a film in which the salvific power of christianity overcomes the natural cruelty of men a film in which albert finds himself in various ridiculous situations moments of misplaced comedy inserted to make him look like a bumbling fool a film in which all the characters are derived from racist minstrel shows the cast comprised of lecherous men always beaming with devilish smiles and toothy grins stereotypical fat mammies jazz bands and gospel choirs this is a film in which black people are naturally childlike readily and happily accepting their social conditions a film in which black people are over sexed carnal sensualists dominated by violent passions a film in which poverty and class issues are entirely invisible albert lives in a huge house and black men are completely inept this is not the old south this is the old south as derived from gone with the wind mgm muscals song of the south warner cartoons halleluha and banned disney movies in other words it s the south as seen by a child raised on s tv it s all so cartoonish so racist in the way it reduces these human beings to one dimensional ethnic stereotypes that black novelist ishmael reed famously likened it to a nazi conspiracy of course in typical spielberg fashion the film ends with family bonds being healed this reconciliation was in walker s novel but spielberg goes further by having every character in the story reconcile with their kin beyond walker s hate letter to black men and spielberg s bizarre caricaturing of black life we are shown nothing of the black community we have only the vaguest ideas as to how any of these characters make a living and no insight into how they interact with others in their community instead spielberg s camera jumps about desperately fighting for our attention one of celie s kitchen contraptions seems like it belongs in a home alone movie every emotion over played the director never stopping to just observe something or to allow a little bit of life to simply pass by couple this with quincy jones ridiculously white music and you have one of the strangest films in cinema history an angry feminist tract filmed by a white jew in the style of disney and griffith scored by a black man trying to emulate john williams problematic too is the lack of white characters consider this the men in this film aren t portrayed as being rough to each other nor do they dominate women because they are brutalised by a racist society which reduces their manhood no they are cruel by nature and the women whether quietly suffering like celie or rebellious and tough like her sister persevere and survive only because the men are too stupid to destroy them a better film would not have focused solely on the oppression of women as it occurs among the oppressed rather it would have shown that it is societal abuse which has led to spousal abuse that enslaved black women are forced to perform the very same tasks as their male counterparts whilst still fulfilling traditional female roles and that african american domestic violence occurs largely because of economic factors women unable to support themselves and their children alone and so there s a hidden ideology at work here late in the film one character tells another that since he didn t respect his wife she wound up getting severely beaten and imprisoned by whites the implication is that blacks need to return to their african roots to restore their own dignity and that it is their fault that whites unjustly crush them ie respect one another in your poor minority community and you won t run afoul of the dominant white culture a failure to confront sex and lesbianism inappropriate musical numbers countless sequence loaded with extraneous visual pizazz incongruous comic business emphatic music cues and wildly hyped emotionality all contribute to rendering the color purple worthless
as far as i can tell you in spite of earlier comments posted by other commentors this film is currently available on dvd i found it only a few weeks ago it is on the value dvd label and i paid the grand total of cents plus tax for it i found it at a cent store among racks of plastic bowls and disposable chopsticks now don t you people who shelled out beau coup bucks for the super duper swedish import limited edition version feel like you were had i thought so this film was indeed well worth cents cents i might start to argue with you but clearly worth cents and remember that saying about getting what you pay for for slasher film mavens only
the cobweb is an example of many examples of movies that feature strong sometimes noteworthy performances and high points but unfortunately are shattered and slowed down drastically by a murky plot and very little to interest the audience it stars richard widmark as a doctor working at a mental institution whose life becomes in turmoil due to family problems and a rather ludicrous and overworked conflict that really seems like no big deal at all the plot is preposterous its time for the institution to get new drapes for the library windows one old woman wants to have her drapes put over them but a lot of the patients want to make their own and somehow this ridiculous and unintentionally loony conflict breaks out into the point where lives are in danger and families start to fall apart it sounds more like a conflict that would occur between very young children the questioning of the logic of the plot and whether it could really happen is so massive that one wonders if only a real like lunatic could buy it don t get me wrong there s nothing wrong with the acting the cast following widmark is composed of other great actors many of them academy award nominees and winners and there is occasionally a moment in the film that works out brilliantly but it always excludes the stupid plot about window drapes unfortunately there is too much about the doggone drapes and thus the movie slows down a lot of the takes are long and done from one camera viewpoint adhering to the slow pacing and lack of viewing interest in a short analysis the cobweb is an unrecognized film and it becomes obvious why to the viewers basically as soon as the plot comes into focus which it does pretty quickly it just really doesn t sound like much fun to watch and i tell you that it is not much fun to watch
boy oh boy oh golly gee the most interesting thing in the movie was the hilarity of the bluescreen effects used to create mom s invisibility they looked like they were shot on cheap video and it looks totally unreal and not even in a good way where its so funny that you end up loving the movie i did not end up loving this movie the attempted steadicam shots were really pathetic as well i mean hey if they had a low budget flick that s fine you can still make a great movie with a low budget but a bad movie and a low budget and effects that makes for a bad combination in this case such a doomed combo created the craptastic film invisible mom if you have kids and your kids have no taste perhaps they will stay awake through all of this one
i am an avid fan of horrendous movies anything cheesy and down right ridiculous is my game so imagine my spirit i went to the local rent shop and found vampires vs zombies the name is just too entertaining you know that no one in the world could pull off something like it it just has to be bad and boy is it bad after viewing this horror ific movie i was speechless literally me and my pal sat outside without saying a word to each other for several minutes both of us contemplating the future of our lives after watching this movie i broke the depressing silence with the words dude what yes i am an enthralling individual heres a quick street review the plot there is none at all ever constantly in wtf mode the characters no development forgettable the music worse than porn the vampires theirs vampires the zombies theirs zombies in the end everyone should see this movie honestly its so bad i yearn to see it again so do yourself a favor watch it and get depressed
i saw his film at the ann arbor film festival i am a film student at the univeristy of michigan so i know a thing or two about film and crispin glover s film is outrageous he basically exploits the mentally challenged not only is shirly temple the anti christ which i admit is a little funny telling the mentally challenged to kill each other but there is an obsession with killing snails crispin also plays with the idea of being in love with one of his actors who is as they all are mentally challenged peta and human rights should be all over this thing it s not counter culture as crispin stated at the ann arbor film festival it s exploitation
for years i remember reading about this show trouble with tracy in the tv guide cfto tv toronto every saturday morning at am i lived about a two hour drive north of toronto and we couldn t get cfto but you know how it is we always want what we can t have well i knew what i wanted and what i wanted was to see what this trouble with tracy was all about did it have a beautiful girl in the starring role was there nudity was there suspense was it a comedy it would ve been fine if there was some promotion of the show at least i could ve known what i was missing but no the mystery drove me bonkers until ctv affiliate ckco built a re transmitter in wiarton ontario and began to broadcast trouble with tracy at the same time as cfto saturday mornings at am one saturday morning i got up and turned the tv on at and at last i got to see what the trouble with tracy was yes the trouble with tracy was that it was canadian content and stuck in the harmless am spot so no one would ever see how awful it was talented canadian actor steve weston died a few years afterward but many would argue he effectively died the first time he appeared on this show when i saw it for the first time that cold saturday morning and fell despondent back into my bed part of me died too
never even knew this movie existed until i found an old vhs copy of it hidden deep in my dusty horror closet the title on the box said insect and the illustrations on the back made clear that it is just another insignificant and poorly produced s horror movie they can surely be fun of course as long as don t expect an intelligent scenario and as long as you re not irritated by seeing a giant amount of cheesy make up effects just about every important aspect that makes a horror movie worthy viewing is substandard here in blue monkey the plot is ridiculous and highly unoriginal the acting performances are painful to observe and there s a total lack of suspense following the always popular trend of big bug movies blue monkey handles about a new and unknown insect species that wipes out the doctors and patients of a remote hospital the makers couldn t be more evasive about the actual origin of this gigantically over sized critter all we know is that it s not from outer space and it initially crawled out of a tropical plant other than this there s absolutely no explanation for where this new type of insect all of a sudden comes from like i said don t get your hopes up for an intelligent screenplay the first half of the film is entertaining enough with some nice gore and the introduction of a couple deranged characters an year old blind and alcoholic lady but the second half when the entire hospital is put to quarantine is dreadfully boring it is also near the end that blue monkey begins to exaggeratedly rip off older and better films approaching the climax they apparently ran out of budget as well since the lighting becomes very poor and the guy in the monster suit isn t very well camouflaged anymore blue monkey is worth a peek in case you re really bored or if you really want to see every s horror movie ever made fans of b cinema may recognize john vernon killer klowns from outer space curtains in the small and meaningless role of roger who s in charge of the clinic
rodney dangerfield is a great he has done a lot of great works but this one is awful the whole plot is whack it could have been much better the jokes in the movie aren t funny their stupid this was very not so hilarious he can do much better than this
last of the johnny weissmuller tarzan films and a good thing too as this is easily the worst of the films he made over a period of years no mermaids are featured here either as a beautiful island woman tries to escape the clutches of her people who worship a god and try to force her to be its bride she finds tarzan and jane who try to protect her george zucco is present as a potentially villainous high priest but isn t used to his full advantage also on hand and worthy of mention is a hugely annoying guitar player singer who goes into song every so often even the great robert florey can t aid this one of four
this is one of the worse cases of film drivel i have seen in a long while it is so awful that i am not sure where to begin or even if it is worth it the plot is the real problem and i feel sorry for sly as he puts in a decent performance for his part but that plot oh dear oh dear i particularly love the way near the end he manages to pop from the foot of a mountain to the top whilst the helicopter is on the way a climb of a day or two takes him all of five minutes i could go on but it isn t worth it apart from the grim opening which even a five year old would be able to predict the outcome of the rest is drivel sorry folks but this is about as bad as film making gets
that s a problem i have with movies that come on television when there is nothing else to watch i somehow get sucked into really bad movies but this one was fairly watchable the concept of being the only ones left on earth after a comet then finding out zombies are around makes me laugh and that s why i gave this movie a instead of the story was stupid but in that way that makes you laugh too stupid funny i think i only watched it because the guy from star trek was the lead i was surprised to see him as a younger guy and he was the only funny character anyway
the only reason i am commenting is because i finally figured out why dr cox was bald although we probably all realized it at the same time this week dr cox is bald because they showed these episodes in a different order than they filmed them the latest episode when our favorite grumpy jesus loving nurse roberts dies dr cox shaves his head the must have showed them out of order for some odd reason and forgot they slipped up the continuity for shame scrubs they ve made mistakes like this before i remember when elliot is trying to date scott foley and her hair is wet seconds before water hits her i try not to notice these things but my favorite show needs to step it up
now that che has finished its relatively short australian cinema run extremely limited release screen in sydney after wks i can guiltlessly join both hosts of at the movies in taking steven soderbergh to task it s usually satisfying to watch a film director change his style subject but soderbergh s most recent stinker the girlfriend experience was also missing a story so narrative and editing seem to suddenly be soderbergh s main challenge strange after odd years in the business he was probably never much good at narrative just hid it well inside edgy projects none of this excuses him this present almost diabolical failure as david stratton warns two parts of che don t even make a whole epic biopic in name only che barely qualifies as a feature film it certainly has no legs inasmuch as except for its uncharacteristic ultimate resolution forced upon it by history soderbergh s hrs long dirge just goes nowhere even margaret pomeranz the more forgiving of australia s at the movies duo noted about soderbergh s repetitious waste of hd digital storage you re in the woods you re in the woods you re in the woods i too am surprised soderbergh didn t give us another hrs of that somewhere between his existing two parts because he still left out massive chunks of che s revolutionary life for a biopic of an important but infamous historical figure soderbergh unaccountably alienates if not deliberately insults his audiences by never providing most of che s story imposing unreasonable film lengths with mere dullard repetition ignoring both true hindsight and a narrative of events barely developing an idea or a character remaining claustrophobically episodic ignoring proper context for scenes whatever we do get is mired in disruptive timeshifts linguistically dislocating all audiences even spanish speakers will be confused by the incongruous expositions in english and pointlessly whitewashing his main subject into one dimension why at this late stage the t shirt franchise has been a success our sense of claustrophobia is surely due to peter buchman and benjamin vander veen basing their screenplay solely on guevara s memoirs so like a poor student who has read only one of his allotted texts for his assignment soderbergh s product is exceedingly limited in perspective the audience is held captive within the same constrained knowledge scenery and circumstances of the revolutionaries but that doesn t elicit our sympathy instead it dawns on us that ah soderbergh s trying to hobble his audiences the same as the latino peasants were at the time but these are the same illiterate latino peasants who sold out the good doctor to his enemies why does soderbergh feel the need to equate us with them and keep us equally mentally captive such audience straitjacketing must have a purpose part is more chronological than part but it s literally mind numbing with its repetitive bush bashing misery of outlook and lack of variety or character arcs deltoro s che has no opportunity to grow as a person while he struggles to educate his own ill disciplined troops the only letup is the humour as che deals with his sometimes deeply ignorant revolutionaries some of whom violently lack self control around local peasants or food we certainly get no insight into what caused the conditions nor any strategic analyses of their guerrilla insurgency such as it was part s excruciating countdown remains fearfully episodic again nothing is telegraphed or contextualized thus even the scenes with fidel castro demi n bichir are unexpected and disconcerting any selected events are portrayed minimally and latino centrically with part s interviews replaced by time shifting meetings between the corrupt bolivian president joaquim de almeida and us government officials promising cia intervention the rest of part s woods and day for night blue filter just exasperate the audience until they re eyeing the exits perhaps deltoro felt too keenly the frustration of many non american latinos about never getting a truthful unspun history of che s exploits within their own countries when foreign governments still won t deliver a free press to their people for whatever reason then one can see how a popular american indie producer might set out to entice the not so well read i may not be able to read or write but i m not illiterate cf the inspector general out to their own local cinemas the film s obvious neglects and gross over simplifications hint very strongly that it s aiming only at the comprehensions of the less informed who still speak little english if they did they d have read tomes on the subject already and critiqued the relevant social issues amongst themselves learning the lessons of history as they should such insights are precisely what societies still need and not just the remaining illiterate latinos of central and south america yet it s what che gleefully fails to deliver soderbergh buries his lead because he s weak on narrative i am gobsmacked why benicio deltoro deliberately chose soderbergh for this project if he knew this it s been yrs hindsight about guevara was sorely wanted it s what i went to see this film for but the director diabolically robs us of that david stratton writing in the australian oct observed that while part was uneven part actually goes rapidly downhill from there charting che s final campaign in bolivia in excruciating detail which feels almost unbearably slow and turgid che the guerilla aka part is certainly no travelogue for bolivia painting it a picture of misery and atavism the entire second half is only redeemed by the aforementioned humour and the dramatic yet tragic capture and execution of the film s subject the rest of this interminable cinema verite is just confusing irritating misery shockingly for a soderbergh film to be avoided at all costs it is bound to break the hearts of all who know even just a smattering about the subject
this film is exactly what you get when you really over stretch your abilities it s like someone who has just passed there driving test and then pitting them in a formula grand prix not i might add the us grand prix as everyone might pull out due to dodgy tyres and you might just win that is how far short this film falls now don t take this the wrong way i love b movies around half my collection is made of b movies but i don t think there are enough letters in the alphabet to describe how bad this film is first of the story for a b movie isn t that bad it has potential there to make a b movie brand were not talking friday th potential but potential none the less but what really lets this film down is the acting at not one second do i believe anything it s like watching qvc except the presenters on qvc tend to have a heavier tan in summary i d like to say i ve seen worse films but i can t
i just rented creep and was not at all impressed i didn t feel anything in this film i felt sick because the gore alone was shocking i walked out of my living room several times in desperation that something would happen with this film haven t we seen this all before i didn t like any of the characters barr the guy in the sewer cage i felt bad for him but then again i couldn t think as to why he was still alive and not murdered by the creep so many questions need to be answered someone mentioned references to the ps game silent hill and i can see similarities vaguely not a bad film not a good one judge for yourself
as interesting as a sheet of cardboard this dispensable period piece has little going for it it s overly wordy and fails spectacularly to evoke the tension and fear that the real life characters must have felt as they dodged the french revolution s fickle hand of justice eric rohmer at it shows
what a disappointment this film seemed to be trying to copy cutting edge comedy but the direction and the script was sloppy sickly and sentimental in the worst film tradition jack black s acting role was self indulgent and self regarding and the other characters were equally unmasking and uninteresting the soundtrack was tedious we are were fans of black but none of us did more than mange a forced titter for the duration why did he feel he needed to make this mistake we will not watch another of his films without reading reviews more carefully first was he drunk when he read the script before signing up for this drivel
the house of the spirits is quite awful i live in south america in a country that suffered a military dictatorship just like the one the movie tries to describe and even though everyone knows movies may be far far away from reality this particular movie treats viewers as both ignorant and stupid things are not so simple and linear as appears here and of course political process are much more complicated and interesting that the plot in the house if you can t show that complexity on screen is better not making a movie at all there are a lot of examples of how can politics be seriously taken in cinema without so many commonplaces in some parts i felt that carmen miranda may appear within parrots and palm trees when you talk about certain things you must be not only careful but respectful to your public s intelligence
it s a bad season for bollywood with all the big releases with a massive hype surrounding proving to be duds at the box office london dreams is no exception to that let s dissect it it s all about chasing your dreams and how far will you go to achieve it sounds impressive right but unfortunately the film is not arjun ajay devgan is an aspiring musician who wants to make it big someday his dream is to perform in wembley stadium in front of a cheering audience calling out his name he is joined by two brothers zoheb wasim debutants aditya roy ranvijay and a ravishing priya asin together they form london dreams their dream band after impressing the chief of a record company they become overnight sensations arjun is secretly in love with priya which he doesn t want to reveal till he achieves his goal arjun then brings his childhood friend manjit khosla aka mannu salman khan a carefree flirtatious guy who has got no ambitions in life to join their band mannu is a trained musician and a real talent for whom later arjun become envious for mannu s superior skills and his affair with priya arjun with the help of zoheb plans to blight mannu what happens next forms the rest of the movies coming to the technical aspects we feel only the shadow of vipul amritlal sha whom we have admired in namaste london felt like he simply visualized the screenplay to cut it short a glorified cameraman screenplay by suresh nair dulls even though it has its moments defined in a predictable fashion the screenplay bore you to stiff camera work was awesome in capturing the beauty of london it s the only entertaining part while watching songs few songs are hummable while others are passable noisy fare ajay was the one who stole the show with his negative character salman is monotonous and he irks you asin is forgettable and i don t that she will make it big in bollywood aditya roy is impressive while ranvijay is strictly ok brinda as the bitch is what we have seen in innumerable movies ompuri is ongoing with the proceedings i don t want to pen down about the flaws as it will be a herculean task finally let me put it simple and straight london dreams is a soulless movie which you may better enjoy on dvd
this programme bugs me there is no humour to it and is far too serious to be called fun it s just far too educational for my liking the characters are very stereotyped and unappealing the plots are redundant and the morals are just repeated over and over again where s the fun in it also i feel this has been on the bbc for far too long and is broadcast way too much does it really need to have a slot on t v every or months when a brand new show runs out of episodes i think it s time that the bbc starting bringing back some of their older shows like inspector gadget bananaman the smurfs snorks moomins the raccoons and count duckula other than continually giving contracts to these newer shows i thought the bbc where bring back danger mouse so what s going on with that
there have been more interesting polish documentaries on worm farming in brail the competition worm farming had a better plot and more interesting characters i was physically ill after watching this movie the cheating husband i think dougray scott was a joke in every meaning of the word poor jennifer must really need the work and what was with the accent the locations and random meetings reminded me of a high school prank and showed the humility of a year old in cooking class it was that bad that i think i will write the sequel named this is not a laxitive thank you for listening it was a great weight of my conscious
a couple of farmers struggle in life in a small village in china wang lung paul muni buys o lan his future wife who becomes his slave luis rainer american stars appear in the leading roles talking with fake accents and emphasizing old stereotypes and patriarchal ideology a good wife many children and land are the best things for men to have they are seen as property and investment because it is a big budget movie in which many extras cooperate big sets are built and special effects take place the movie makers could not take the risk of hiring less popular actors luise rainer won an academy award for this performance which is definitely the worst in the movie her immutable face builds a barrier between her and the audience o lan is supposed to be the heart of the family and the best character to sympathize with on the other hand paul muni gives a better performance showing his talent ones again another problem with the movie is the ending it seems like franklin did not know when to end the picture this film could be dangerous if it is taken as a truly example of chinese culture and traditions
this movie is made for asian chinese market targeting particularly fans of jay chou one of the biggest music star in asian jay chou is a very talented song writer singer he is mediocre as an actor although he did appear in several big budget productions initial d curse of the golden flower amazingly he won both golden horse taiwan and hong kong film awards for initial d the supporting cast are very well chosen which appeals basically everyone from china the cast including many famous movie tv actors singers even sport commentator huang jianxiang from china however they were not given enough time to show their talents the biggest mistake is that chu took over both director and writer position he has a reputation of making shallow and brainless movies based off non coherent scripts with his poor directing and lam story the whole talented cast fancy vision effects and tones of production money was wasted however the terrible movie successfully cashed in over million dollars maybe even more in asian which made this one of the biggest box office success in asian the bottom line is you can watch this movie only if you want to see how money and talents are wasted or if you are simply accompanying your kids who are fans of jay chou
am i wrong or is the version just a rip off of the original i have to ask because the dvd i just bought is one of the worst films i have ever seen bad acting bad editing etc the only exploitation aspect here is how we were ripped off for our money buying this piece of crap it is nothing more than a light weight porn flick no real gore no scary images just a cheaply done bit of garbage if anyone wants to see an excellent film with no name actors some slimy gore and a decent storyline get baby blood also done on a cheap budget but well made and an actual story too i spit was a waste of money but i ll keep it just for a laugh it is pathetic new comment sept i ll keep this film forever just because it it sooooo bad it s almost good in a really bad way the worst acting ever a real crap movie classic
blank check is one of those kids movies that could have been a great suspense thriller for the kids but instead it s a tired lame home alone ripoff that isn t worth a dime quigley is a criminal who just escaped from jail and gets his hidden million dollars from a big score and then we meet preston a frustrated kid whose room is taken over by his brothers to start a business and obviously dad treats his brothers better because they make money the same day he goes to a kid s birthday party and since his dad is a cheapo he goes on little kids rides while the other kids go on roller coasters then he receives a birthday card and a check of bucks how cheap is this family so he goes to the bank to open an account and meets the gorgeous shea stanley were her parents mets fans he finds out he needs to open a account meanwhile quigley gives his million to his banker friend and finds out the bills are marked so he will send a lackey named juice to get the unmarked ones when preston leaves his bike gets run over by quigley he s about to write a check when he spots the cops and bolts back home his parents scolded him about his busted up bike and gets grounded what their kid got almost run over and they worried about a bike so preston forges a million dollar check via his computer and comes back only to be escorted to the banker thinking that he s juice he gives preston the money but the real juice came and realized they been duped by a kid so preston buys a mansion under the name macintosh gets a limo driver who says unfunny jokes and goes on a epic shopping spree then he spots shea and talks about opening his account kid you re loaded and you re talking about opening an account we soon realized shea is actually an fbi agent tracking down quigley and his two other accomplice s then he told his cheapy dad he s got a job working for mr macintosh and spends the day riding go karts playng vr games and hanging out with his limo driver buddy then he goes out on a date with shea in a fancy restaurant what a year old wining and dining a something fbi agent afterwards he takes her to a street geyser and playing around in the water messing up shea s dollar dress yet she takes it well if this was a bit realistic she would slap him for messing up her expensive dress so quigley and the others still mad interrogates a little kid and quickly spills the beans and preston is being chased by quigley in a scene taken from the original script and afterwords he is hosting mr macintoshs birthday which is really his birthday when he discovers he couldn t pay for the party he sits in his chair and dad talks to macintosh which he doesn t know it s his son he s talking to and talks about preston should be a real kid and has his whole childhood ahead of him and wants preston to go home early what an hour ago you were grilling him about his finances so preston asks everyone to leave and sits alone pondering when quigley and the others break in to the house to make preston pay and so he faces then in a finale that rips off home alone quigley gets spun around in a ball while preston is driving a go kart juice gets hit in the groin and more antics ensue until the trio get preston cornered and when it seem all hope is lost shea and a bunch of swat guys come to save the day and so quigley and his crew get sent to jail but is there any hope for preston and shea there is and she kisses him in the lips what what what a grown woman kissed a kid in the lips come on is she mentally disabled i mean an fbi agent who knows the country s laws would risk her career to kiss a kid she could get arrested on the spot and the most creepiest part of all is that isn t goodbye and she ll see him in or years oh dear and so he comes home to his family celebrating his birthday so the moral of the story is love and respect can be bought what are they smoking the bottom line is that is a waste of time the morals are whacked it s flat as a tortilla the kid is annoying the villains are lame the comic relief isn t funny the brothers are unlikable the dad is even worse the romantic subplot is creepy the plot s shallow and the only saving grace is the cinematography from bill pope which went on to shoot the matrix trilogy and two of the spider man films so people don t waste your money and go watch home alone instead this has been a samuel franco review
i cannot believe that they managed to spend us million on this film spectacularly bad acting egregious scripting and effects that you could do on your average pc unbelievable plot contrivances a reporter who can get an inexperienced stewardess a major job at the un what not only that but the message of this film is so unsubtle that you come out feeling as if they ve tried to batter you over the head with a full size crucifix all this movie will do will preach to the choir and make everyone else laugh at such a ridiculous waste of money if the makers of this film really wanted to sway people to christianity and show what it means to truly believe they would have used the money to help people truly in need now that might have swayed some people into actually listening to them
i didn t feel as if i d been raped like i did with the enchanted christmas but belle s magical world is still the antithesis of beauty and the beast like christmas bmw hates its audience although not to such an extreme degree it s ugly uncanonical idiotic and the writing is horrifically bad none of the stories work these are not the characters we loved from batb at all they re a bunch of pod people i wanted to dissect it but after a few minutes i gave up because no one in their right mind would take this claptrap seriously what we have here are three stories the perfect word is an overbearing ponderous study of forgiveness fifi s folly only works if you can accept that babette s name is actually fifi and that she s a closet james bond villainess and that lumiere is an idiot concerning women broken wing or broken wind as i like to call it is probably the most heinous of the bunch beast hates birds since when don t watch this crap every copy of this video deserves to be cremated beauty and the beast is still a cinematic classic a transcendent celebration of love art intelligence and the human soul
interesting story about a soldier in a war who misses out on saving the life of a young girl from the enemy and is haunted by this event even though he did save many other captive children the film flashes a head and this soldier is now a teacher in a high school that is managed mostly by policemen patrolling the hallways bathrooms and even class rooms in other words the high school is a prison and most of the kids pay very little attention to their teachers or principal dolph lundgren sam decker plays the soldier school teacher and decides he is going to quit teaching and go into another field however the principal asks him to have a detention class as his last duty as a teacher it is at this point in the film when all hell breaks loose and the story becomes a complete bomb try to enjoy it if you decided to view it
his costume drama is ill cast and without charm george sanders was a superb character actor but he is thoroughly implausible here as the lead an eighteenth century rogue known for his philosophy and great good looks his costar is of all people akim tamiroff some frenchman then there s signe hasso in a dark wig as the virginal daughter of a wealthy family carole landis fares best the movie opens with her in silhouette she is a soubrette and a naughty girl at that she disappears for a while but turns up in an improbably situation but she s good she was always an appealing actress here she is cast closest to her usual type of role it s meant to be a little naughty kind of ooh la la it ought to have had a light touch but it s a leaden affair from start to finish
randolph scott is leaving the usa for the greener pastures of canada s british columbia he wants to start a cattle ranch there with partner bill williams and cook lee tung foo they stampede their small herd over a toll bridge erected by victor jory later jory rustles their cattle and williams loses his left arm during the fracas from until when he retired randolph scott made a series of good adult themed westerns some of them considered real classics unfortunately the cariboo trail will never be listed among his best westerns it s more like the material that roy rogers or gene autry might use the story is downright silly at times williams who was along for the ride with scott he wanted to go prospect for gold as there was a big strike at the time he doesn t blame the rustlers he blames scott for convincing him to make the trip for the loss of his arm also there s a scene in the film when scott lee tung foo and gabby hayes are captured by indians they escape because gabby s mule has been taught to kick on command and he kicks away at the indians allowing our heroes to escape i m not sure that would have played in a rogers film furthermore the story actually wants you to believe that tyro prospector randolph scott accidentally stumbles on a gold strike after just a few lessons from prospector gabby hayes on how to find gold this was gabby hayes s farewell feature film part it would have been better had he gone out in a good western and in fact he had done a couple of better ones with randolph scott before this i will say this though no caribou made any appearance in the film this is one of the few canadian locale films from the past that did not have any mounties but if i were you unless you are a big fan of randolph scott or gabby hayes take the next detour off the cariboo trail
this has to be one of the worst films i have ever seen without a doubt the only thing interesting in this film is the cameo appearances from some great genre directors and king himself the film has a great premise but falls apart about minutes into the story i did like madchen amick in this film and think she could have a very good career in film
if you enjoy films like american pie road trip van wilder avoid this cinematic refuse at all costs it is an unamusing mean spirited insipid waste of resources that should never have been discussed aloud much less actually recorded and sold to unsuspecting consumers easily the worst film i have seen in the past months mind numbingly bad for the entire minutes of it s runtime had it been much longer i would not have been able to write this review without using profanity consider yourself warned
i just finished a marathon of this series and it became agonising to watch as it progressed from the fictionalising of the historical elements to o herlihy s awful accent in later episodes the show just slumps the further it goes if you are looking for some low quality production generalised ww fluff then i could recommend season but avoid anything after that it degenerates into being one step from a soap opera with increasingly worse story lines and sensibility the old b w film is by far the best of any form of entertainment with the colditz name attached to it and even that is not what one could hope for
this might be unbelievable but this movie has grossed in russia it s shown in almost all cinema theaters and still running well i have no idea why distributors put their eye on this particular uh movie which had almost no screening around the world that s some kind of enigma haha maybe it was based on the fact that another movie pledge this with paris hilton which was as well released only dvd almost everywhere had major screenings in russia and grossed more than mln besides both movies had a lot of promotion like there were the banners all over the city tv commercials and etc speaking about movie i d say it s dull and absolutely boring it could be better really even if it has jessica simpson
chinese ghost story iii is a totally superfluous sequel to two excellent fantasy films the film delivers the spell casting special effects that one can expect but fails painfully on all other fronts the actors all play extremely silly caricatures you have to be still in diapers to find their slapstick humor even remotely funny the plot is predictable and the development is sometimes erratic and often slow towards the end the movie begins to resemble old godzilla films including shabby larger than life special effects and a well yet another ghost with a godzilla head maybe i would have grinned if i was expecting camp it is astonishing to see what trash fantasy fans have to put up with in this case because somebody thought they could squeeze a little extra money out of a successful formula they won t be able to do it again the cash cow is now dead as a dodo
i saw paris je t aime because a friend really wanted to see it so i went along with him going in i was indifferent about the film but leaving the theater i really regretted wasting hours of my life sitting through this tepid production the stories are almost completely forgettable except for the fact that most of them were awful what do gena rowlands and ben gazzara have to do with paris the endless parade of american actors most definitely gave this french film a remarkably non french feel the clich s about paris were endless yes most of them were playing with clich s about paris but by spending so much time making fun of french clich s they directly and regrettably promoted them once more yes paris is the city of love we get it the worst segments were the one directed by wes craven oscar wilde the one with nick nolte the mime one the worst the hair products one the one with juliette binoche willem dafoe as a cowboy in the middle of paris the vampire one when i think of paris i think of elijah wood the one with natalie portman which really looked like a mentos commercial and it was stupid the blind young man should know portman was just playing a part when she called him on and on it went it felt endless i didn t like the coen bros one as well it really plays with those parisien clich s but i didn t find it funny just annoying the gus van sant one was interesting but it was so slight and the punchline was obvious that it barely registered there were only two successful segments and they were the one about the immigrant nanny who leaves her baby at a kindergarten only to babysit a baby for a rich woman nice irony there and the segment about the african who is stabbed it s the best segment in the whole film but this segment has nothing to do with paris the story could have taken place in any city around the world the last segment the one with the chubby middle aged woman was sorta interesting too but the underlying tone was bad they wanted to celebrate her limited grasp of french but the segment came off as being condescending the whole project felt forced and uninspired almost like the french government sponsored this film to promote tourism all in all with only about to minutes of interesting stuff paris je t aime was an awful cinematic experience
adrianne should really get a life without mr brady she nauseates me and has been one of the main reasons why i know longer tune in to the show it s pretty brainless show and every little argument or disagreement seems to be put under the scope and analyzed to death this makes them look sound they are anything but ready for marriage and yet i know these disagreements are all part of life i guess to some people this is entertainment if this happens to fall into next season i will feel sorry for anyone who has nothing better to do with their life but watch this trash though i would not be terribly surprised can t even stand the commercials for this show anymore i hope they re getting enough money to constantly embarrass themselves in front of a camera week after week however the a girl has one heck of great butt
i had numerous problems with this film it contains some basic factual information concerning quantum mechanics which is fine although quantum physics has been around for over years the film presents this information in a grandiose way that seems to be saying aren t you just blown away by this well not really these aren t earth shattering revelations anymore at any rate i was already familiar with quantum theory and the fact that particles have to be described by wave equations etc is not new the main problem i have with this movie however is the way these people use quantum theory as a way of providing a scientific basis for mysticism and spiritualism i don t have any serious problem with mysticism and spiritualism but quantum mechanics doesn t really have anything to do with these things and it should be kept separate the people they interviewed for this movie start with the ideas of quantum theory and then make the leap to say that simply by thinking about something you can alter the matter around you hence we should think positively so as to have a positive impact on the world and make our lives better the reasoning is completely ridiculous and the conclusions do not logically follow from quantum theory for every so called expert that they interviewed for this film there are scores of theoretically physicists who would completely disagree they would point out quite rightly that the unpredictability of the subatomic world does not lend support to mystical notions about our spiritual connectedness it disturbs me that people are going to see this film and completely eat it up because it leaves them with a nice positive feeling the main thrust of the film is based on a total misinterpretation of quantum theory and it is as bad in its reasoning as any attempt to justify organized religion with similar pseudo scientific arguments avoid this film oh yeah at one point one of the experts says that since throughout history most of the assumptions people have made about the world turned out to be false therefore the assumptions we currently hold about the world are also likely to be false huh that totally does not follow and even if it did i don t see how that helps his argument i mean if his ideas ever became common assumptions then i guess we would have to assume that they are false too based on his own reasoning
so has it really come to this are we as consenting adults to blame for the next generation of cinema goers lack of cinematic understanding and celluloid capability concerning the wayans and co latest addition to the moving pictures scenario little man this united kingdom p g parental guidance anyone under the age of twelve must be accompanied by a responsible adult certificated movie is the epitome of what has now developed into the worse case of dumbing down since cigarettes were wiped out from pictures of movie icons of the s the predominantly under twelve s audience here who some without grown up supervision too sat there obediently taking it all in oblivious to their subject and the partly grown up features that little man portrays in part at least too movies in general can do better than this poor attempt while this nonsense is getting them in while they are still young and fresh the biggest fear for the future of cinema is that a child s ignorance just might carry on through to a grown up bliss cinema deserves more than this and so do its ever growing and in the literal sense too audiences this blatant cash cow feeds on the ever impressionable minds of the young there is no cinema experience here no open eyed wonder no awe inspiring respect to the magic of movies there is nothing but bewilderment and contempt for the lack of substance originality and its delivery of mind less tedium and parody of everything that is so now ultimately wrong with the hollywood machine for the sake of a quick buck we must endure our future cinema audiences to the likes of this archetypal disaster movie will this have the likes of hitchcock fassbinder leone kubrick and schaffner reeling in their graves money they all liked no doubt but talent and exuberance for perfection and quality and to a vast degree respect for their profession and audience they were never short off we are seeing once again with the works of the wayans clan another clich of bad taste while the likes of white chicks were in no doubt a stab at the bourgeoisie of american society the irony here is that the two leading protagonists played yet again by the wayans brothers are so much undercover that all recognition is non existent this makes for a better movie too and it is the actor terry crews that gives white chicks its substance and personality not the wayans yet again with their pastiche of s blaxploitation movies as with the movie i m gonna git you sucka this to can be seen as a comical and amusing movie with heavy weights as isaac hayes jim brown bernie casey and the gorgeous actress ja net du bois the point being that little man has absolutely no persona of any kind what so ever he is shallow and narcissistic with no appreciation or value toward his followers he quickly dives in takes your money and before we know it has hidden himself within the cogs of commercialism there is no recognisable effort as to where our money has been spent after scary movie things could only have gone up but alas they did not no great pondering of artistic value and no doubt that the instalment from these intrepid movie moguls next movies shall be straight to video one can only hope the wayans seem to have created a movie genre all by themselves to a certain extent they have bludgeoned to death the movie parody they have watered down each and every avenue and with their inevitable style they have slowly destroyed the reputation of the last one hundred years that cinema have given us may the ghosts of movies past be ever so humble in their judgement as their growing audiences so far seem to be for when the bubble bursts may they be as understanding too
luise rainer received an oscar for her performance in the good earth unfortunately her role required no she did not say much and looked pale throughout the film luise s character was a slave then given away to marriage to paul muni s character he did a fantastic job for his performance set in ancient asia both actors were not asian but were very convincing in their roles i hope that paul muni received an oscar for his performance because that is what luise must have gotten her oscar for she must have been a breakthrough actress one of the first to method act this seems like something that hollywood does often al pacino has played an italian and cuban i felt luise s performance to be lackluster throughout and when she died she did not change in expression from any previous scenes she stayed the same throughout the film she only changed her expression or emotion maybe twice if her brilliant acting was so subtle i suppose i did not see it
nice attempt and good ideas redemption of the prostitute human beings helping each other out but a poor result the director obviously tried to emulate his french colleague tran anh hung by recreating an ambiance which is suppose to portray viet nam the only problem is that this viet nam is long gone and when the scent of the green papaya had a historical background trying to project this kind of ambiance muffled sounds and the slow pace of life on modern days leaves a feeling of fake besides it rapidly creates a sentiment of boredom and the outcome becomes too obvious i can only suppose the action takes place in saigon or da nang because that is where harvey keitel ex marine in the movie was probably stationed during the war but in southern viet nam nobody or very few people speak with the clip northern accent displayed by the actors seriously odd even for a bad vietnamese speaker an old poet with leprosy very doubtful not a disease for people of his condition a peasant girl who can read and write elaborate vietnamese poetry even more doubtful
this rather formulaic swords and flying fists movie is a decent early display of john woo s talents the cinematography is excellent and some of the sword work is truly remarkable unfortunately the film labours under the burden of a dull story and a glaringly low budget check some of the setbound fight scenes if you doubt me nonetheless it s worth seeing especially if you can catch in letterboxed
this movie provided nothing new or worthwhile after seeing it my wife and i both agreed that the studio simply churned this out and could have cared less if it was entertaining this is a good example of a concept only film they have a concept about a film and the other details are unimportant because execs know it will make just based on the initial concept the movie starts with cruella getting out of prison and going on parole she no longer hates puppies but has been programmed to adore them she simply couldn t hurt a flea this doesn t last too long after her release and she s back to her old ways period the most annoying aspects of the movie were the supporting characters eric idle as the voice of waddlesworth the bird made me hate him and that is tough considering i am a die hard python fan it was obvious he did this because they gave him lots of money there can t be any other reason cruella s low self esteem servant tim mcinnerny was funny in the black adder shows but here he is totally wasted and unfunny and it must have cost a few bucks to get g rard depardieu but he was utterly wasted as well there were some other supporting actors as well but given how poorly written the characters were i am trying to block them out of my mind overall you d be better just to let your kids watch television than bother letting them see this drivel
this movie is not just bad not just corny it is repulsive something about daphne about the creepy call girl about the whole damn and i use the word literally film radiates a grotesquery that would offend a brothel mistress this film makes my skin crawl makes me regret having reproductive organs and makes me feel unclean one of the things that bothers me most about this movie is that they used such a good concept a creature that makes fantasies with disastrous results rather than the clich worst nightmare and the overdone twisted wish is a truly fascinating film idea thought the reason why hobgoblins need to be killed before day is that they are attracted to bright lights during the day bright lights don t show up well so they could go anywhere count the hobgoblins four hobgoblins drive out of the film studio and yet at least nine of the pernicious plush toys are killed throughout the course of the movie discussion question if you had a frigid demanding unappreciative girlfriend would you enter garden tool combat with a military chunkhead explain
i think i laughed twice the line where the main character says something about being from the streets and then i forget the other time i laughed it was probably in the beginning this has to be one of the thinnest movies ever doesn t hollywood realize that this kind of humor is degrading and sad really you can only insult yourself so many times
let me start by saying that i totally agree with the basic thesis of the film that there probably was no historical jesus and christianity is a sham with that said this movie does a pretty poor job of proving that thesis it makes good arguments the gap between jesus theoretical life and the writing of the gospels filled only by the writings of paul who doesn t indicate a historical jesus and then utterly fails to convincingly argue them it makes broad statements without presenting the evidence the statements are based on and it resolutely ignores counter arguments presented by christian apologists the intellectual dishonesty emotional manipulation and lack of serious argument are obvious and stunning the only christians we hear from in the film are the head of the filmmaker s old school who comes off like a reasonable rational person attempting to deal with a twit with a chip on his shoulder and various christians encountered apparently at random in a parking lot i m sorry but revealing that average christians don t know much about their religion isn t exactly damning evidence of christianity s fraudulence you may as well claim that jay leno has disproved the existence of michael dukakis on his jay walking segment the interviews with experts can be interesting but the film is filled with too much of let s be honest the filmmaker just being snarky within the first five minutes the film has already conflated jerry falwell with charles manson and the writers of the left behind series with the branch davidians and by the end the film becomes so self centered that there s no rational argument left just an angry former christian lashing out at the people and places he blames for his messed up childhood y know maybe that movie could ve been interesting but it s misplaced in a documentary about the historicity of jesus and it s so self congratulatory as to deflate any sympathy this is a michael moore film without the humor or the film making acumen combined with a richard dawkins book without the wit or the intellectual rigor skip it
lois weber self proclaimed missionary via the cinema wrote directed and produced other films on controversial subjects but this may be the first to get wide viewing thanks to tcm this film is her indictment of abortion but she cleverly muddles the issue by bringing in eugenics and birth control leaving the impression that they are somehow equivalent to abortion her talent in writing and the other cinematic skills are well displayed here but one may be forgiven for wishing she had used them less didactically if you have wondered what tyrone power jr s famous father looked like here is your chance fashions and automobiles are also on display to add to the interest of this museum piece it s enjoyable even if you don t appreciate the propaganda
the priyadarshan paresh rawal combo has been golden before with the likes of hera pheri and hungama so i went into the movie at an indian multiplex with high hopes especially after the slick promos unfortunately like hulchul before it this movie was a huge disappointment like others have commented the premise of the movie which was already stale to begin with just gets stretched on and on without any development or additional layering after a while you just want the movie to end so you can go home if i had been watching this at home it would have been much easier to cut my losses akshay kumar s performance is average at best and john abraham should not try doing comedy again the comedy aspects of the movie overall were pretty week i only remember giggling like twice the entire movie definitely no sidesplitting belly laughs that consumed me in hera pheri or even to a lesser extent in awara paagal deewana paresh rawal had a few of his expected classic moments but overall because his role and character wasn t given much room to grow he didn t make much of an impact in this film neha dhupia who makes only an appearance in the movie was fun to look at while she was on screen and some of the songs are fun especially the opening and closing songs of ada and kiss me baby respectively otherwise you re better off just passing on this movie
i like a lot of the actors actresses involved in this project so being insulted by the movie felt even worse than if they used a unknowns the main problem was this movie was clearly just a concept created to appeal to baby boomers in or years nbc will probably do a movie just like this about the early s i can see it now a black family where the kids are involved with the la riot s and the white family has the kids rebel and listen to grunge rock music the soundtrack will feature bands like nirvana n w a public enemy soundgarden etc the movie like this will be just as cheesy as the s and i gurantee you nbc will do it see the biggest problem with period pieces when done buy networks is that when you are living in a certain time period you aren t thinking i am living in the s or whatever decade is trendy retro at the time next time someone does something like this they should put more weight into there project
for anyone craving a remake of s slaves of new york what are there seven of you here it is was this undercooked movie has studiously vapid characters well they re club kids ya big jerk that are in holding patterns the big question seems to be just how long can a young adult remain juvenile it took three people to write this story good god it was easier to come up with citizen kane rather than take viewers back this movie should just embarrass anyone who was a scene ster in the early s the idea that a fifty year old woman envies a bunch of self absorbed kids from a different era is the world as only self absorbed twenty somethings could imagine it the odd sidebar about library work is not the sub plot one expects from the equivalent of parker posey s breakin electric bugaloo her i m serious about graduate school while a stripper grinds on her is hysterical posey s shtick is always amusing but there are projects that are beneath her i was asleep before it crossed the minute mark
i would rather have root canals than go through this film again the prince of annoying myles berkowitz has wasted nearly two hours of my life with this piece of cynical pseudo cool the only amusing thing in this whole mess is mr samaha s obnoxious off camera patter about tits and ass berkowitz takes a great concept and grinds it into the dust it is choppy and badly done in an apparent effort to make it seem edgy or funny it is neither i seldom feel that a movie was a waste of film or tape but this one qualifies for that distinction if a date suggests seeing this film run
but i ve seen better too the story here is predictable a film crew trying to film a horror movie in a place where murders occurred three guesses what happens this isn t a total bomb the cast is fairly good with pros john ireland faith domergue and john carradine giving the best performances it s reasonably well made for a low budget film just don t expect any nudity swearing blood or gore the film has a very mild pg rating i was never totally bored it s ok viewing on a quiet night i saw it on video it was a horrible print very dark and some scenes were impossible to see still i didn t hate it and it does have a cool ending which surprised me basically nothing happens up till then so it catches you off guard worth seeing but only if you re a horror film completest
following the appalling attack force chances were that seagal could only have a step up with flight of fury to out stink attack force would take some doing flight of fury is a marked improvement overall but still in the grand scheme of thinks mediocre mediocrity is seemingly an achievement for seagal these days a sad insight into his movie career s decline where attack force was a hodge podge of plot lines altered drastically from conception to filming to post production flight of fury keeps the plot line more simple someone steals a high tech stealth fighter planning to use it to fire chemical weapons which we later bizarrely discover will destroy the whole world in hrs seagal has to get the plane back it s that simple no annoying sub plots and conspiracies weighing the film down like far too many of his recent works that s not to suddenly say the storytelling is good though it s pretty poor the introduction to side characters is badly done for example in filmic terms fof is bad it s badly acted by all involved and seagal looks bored to tears almost he s just got the look of a toddler who s been forced to perform the school nativity against his will and so performs with a constant grimace and air of half assedness can we blame seagal though when the material is so un ambitious and cruddy not really this is the final film of his castel studio s multi picture deal the producers can t be bothered to make anything remotely good promising a or so million dollar budget and after seagal s obligatory million probably pocketing a nice hefty chunk of it themselves if the film was made for the remaining million then i m elvis pressley so in that respect why should seagal put the effort into a film that s already got distribution sorted before it s made fan s though may argue he at least owes them the effort he s seriously looking jaded and the continued use of stand ins and dub overs is further indication of this michael keusch directs with some efficiency while the cinematography is quite good but in all technical areas and as usual with castel a bog standard stunt team there s nothing more than mediocrity and nothing to help the film rise above its material and bored leading man again there s a few action scenes focusing on characters other than seagal which in all truth we don t want to see overall the action isn t too bad it s nice and violent and on occasion we re treated to a few vintage nasty seagal beatings but overall nothing special partly due to a poor stunt crew and the lack of time to film anything too complex or exciting for me shadow man was a more enjoyable film because while ignoring the incoherent jumbled plot line there were more vintage seagal moments and more of him in centre stage he never disappeared for long periods during the film seagal disappears bizarrely during one action scene here and re appears after with little explanation there s far too much stock footage used using stock shots isn t an entirely horrendous thing but using it as a crutch is we re treated to countless establishing shots of naval ships all the time which get annoying plus the continuity of the stock footage is all over the place just check the backdrops chopping and changing the film is just middle of the road it says it all that the films best scene is a completely needless and gratuitous girl on girl scene with two hot chicks seagal even perks up briefly then too overall this may be one of the better stock footage based actioners out there but that s not saying much at all this will please many fans but they should bear in mind seagal himself would probably want to forget this one s existence
wow this movie sucked big time i heard this movie expresses the meaning of friendship very well and with all the internet hype on this movie i figured what could go wrong however the movie was just plain bad it was boring and the character development was never there space travelers was also a horrible movie if you didn t like that movie there is no way you will like this
this was a better than average movie i thought for it being on cable i had expected something along the lines of cheesy melodrama and bad special effects seen in such classics as christmas rush or first daughter target shot etc the cast was well chosen i especially liked ron livingston as the hard pressed swat commander it s good to see him revisiting the same material he had so much fortune with in band of brothers the producers and designers had done their homework because all the scenes and shots looked like they did on that day back in so if you get a chance to see this film and i am sure you will since fx reruns everything times take hours and enjoy it
well the movie was a fun watch the main problem with this movie is the fact that it goes against everything that most vampire myths abide by like vampires that walk in the sunlight though there are parts that just make you enjoy the way society makes movies a scene where a vampire gets stabbed and screams ow this hurts it s really stuck then there seems like there might be scenes missing but you get used to after a while and there are random dream sequenes that really don t help with the plot come to think of it nothing really made sense but i just got a bunch of friends and watched it twice to get the full effect come to think of it the fight scenes were aweful and the zombies were just fun to watch slowly as i write more of this i like this movie more but you know all in all you can t expect schindlers list but its a fun watch
this is not really a proper review since i did not see most of the film i stopped watching it the film is very violent with nasty drug dealers and street punks but that is not why i stopped watching here was the problem i watched just enough to be introduced to several characters all of whom were not interesting everyone was a tedious despicable psychopath with no engaging personalities giving me nothing to look forward to i found myself not the least bit curious about what they would do next or what might happen to them if there had been even one person of interest and i don t mean good or nice person i mean an interesting person i could have stayed with it watch state of grace to see what i mean in that film the gary oldman character is a complete lunatic but he is very interesting al pacino perhaps did a good job in scarface but his character just did not engage me
all logic goes straight out of the train window in this british horror film set in the london underground and starring the usually reliable franka potente run lola run franka plays kate a businesswoman on the way from an office party to meet friends who falls asleep at an underground station only to wake up and find she has been locked in and finds herself being chased by someone or something with killer intentions plot holes and unbelievability are rife and there are very few moments that are actually jumpy scary but plenty that are just plain dull all in all an unpleasant film that should just stay locked underground forever and do us all a favour the only plus point here is the inclusion in the cast of popular veteran actor ken campbell who s done better than this that s even including erasmus microman
i couldn t believe that this movie dates from it had all the looks of a below average seventies horror flick didn t they have any knowledge of modern special effects or cgi didn t they know that in the post millennium the violence in a supposed horror and or scifi movie should at least be a little bit graphic or did i get the purpose wrong was it supposed to be a deep and meaningful story of man and animal bound together in the big cycle of life or a warning to mankind not to mess with nature or something like that it doesn t really matter either way it turned out wrong and to me this movie failed on all accounts first of all the premise is very improbable if at a given time you re capable of replacing a total eye no responsible medical scientist would start his very first human attempt with both eyes at the same time that s totally unprofessional and to do all this apparently without informed consent of the patient and why on earth choose for eyes that have a totally unusual color for humans and make the victim look like a freak by the way i noticed that all the real wolves in the movie had puppy like normal dark eyes couldn t they have waited for such a specimen the story is lame it s about this poor guy aaron who gets these weird eye transplants which suddenly makes him feel like the donor wolf or at least that s what i make of it and then he s being chased by some military men especially this last bit is ridiculous i mean i can understand that the army is interested in the results of the experiment imagine soldiers with night vision eye sight but as the operation fails on account of the apparent nervous breakdown of the patient it s beyond me why they re out to kill him why not leave him alone and look for another usable recipient a volunteering soldier maybe and why try to kill everyone else that s involved with poor aaron isn t that a bit steep who the hell are these militaries anyway i hope not the us army or the government they behave like psychopaths walking around the hospital waving automatic weapons raiding private apartments like they re after some public enemy and displaying during the ultimate show down in the woods a total lack of discipline like a bunch of frightened schoolchildren panicking and shooting randomly around aaron for some unfathomable medical reason feels like a wolf after the transplantation of the eyes why would that be he suddenly sees visions of wandering wolves what is this are we supposed to believe that the memories of the donor wolf are situated in it s eye balls and that the recipient of these eye balls also adopts the wolf s craving for red life meat and can jump off of a feet high balcony and land unharmed on his all fours like a cat can a wolf even do that the acting or the lack thereof didn t help the credibility of all this either everyone stumbles through their lines like wooden dolls especially this indian girl she may be pretty but she can only come up with one expression vexed and some disinterested mumblings about the force of nature and it beats me why aaron all of a sudden is all over her but hey there probably had to be at least one love scene i really sympathized with actor cory monteith who seems like a nice guy with a handsome enough face but they didn t give him much to go with he has to run around bare chested for more than half of the movie which could have been fun to watch but then they had better chosen someone with a more impressive physique monteith really should leave his shirt on his few killings and attacks are hardly shown we just hear some growling and cries of fear and then there s another victim lying down and aaron with some more blood on his face and chest not much for a modern sci fi horror the only good acting came from justine bateman and i really like to see how she has matured into a beautiful and classy forty something lady she did what she could with her silly lines and she even convinced me of being this doctor with good intentions but they made her character a kind of a wimp who gets totally bossed around by the leader of these militaries what a pity that the script didn t make her stand up a bit more in the end this sums up as being a silly and rather boring movie hardly scary or thrilling with unbelievable goings on a lot of overlong national geographic like visuals of wolves running around woods and slopes who cares some pretentious indian ramblings about man and nature and an uneven musical score with poppy songs at the most inappropriate moments i guess the word superfluous covers it all
this movie is truly one of the worst pieces of garbage ever it really is surprising that something so completely terrible could be made but if you can stand the mind numbing plot character development and direction you may get a kick out of the soundtrack which is so appalling that it is funny the movie begins terribly and quickly becomes unwatchable someone should give anyone involved with this movie some sort of consolation because their career was probably ruined because of involvement in this movie if you do end up seeing this movie or have seen it already i feel your pain then these words have come too late for anyone else stay away at all costs or realize that the movie is so bad that it will waste hours of your life then at least you can clean up or something while viewing it
my wife and i watch a film every night with no distractions and mostly artsy films that require thought i have tons of patience for films that are slow to blossom my wife has double the attention span that i do all that being said this film is just plain empty and boring it went nowhere never blossomed it started fairly strong with a promising plot then she bakes cookies goes to spain she sulks she stares the credits roll uneven full of holes false starts dead ends we ff d through several extended sequences of her just staring off into space artificial depth was implied when she played with the mud and cried zzzz it s like a beautifully shot chick flick that s pretending to be deep or artsy you never get to know nor understand morvern at all about halfway through you just don t care anymore we just wanted to see at least one of the plot lines develop don t waste your time on this i m shocked it scores so high
the imdb plot summary in no way describes the essence of this film it should have read be prepared to be catapulted back to the prison of the rd pew from the back of your family s church at years old listening to the preacher drone on about god s will while all you can think of is getting back home to your lego it starts off well intentioned building intrigue by planting some real and surreal clues such as renny s how did the cut on my thumb heal so fast moment it then slowly morphs into a christian jamboree sacrificing its plot completely in a wash of evangelistic induced babble i believe i counted the use of the word pray about times in a five minute span near the end after the st i tried to twist the context of the word to its synonym prey sadly this little mind game of mine made the film at least bearable for the last minutes plus it made me laugh whenever a character would say prayer preyer to me as it became totally zany indeed even my catholic wife sunk in her chair from boredom almost to the point of ending up on the floor for all the salivating christians who ranked this film stars i suggest sticking with your theology reinforcing safety standards like circle square the ten commandments anything from narnia jesus christ superstar and the like stay away from more cerebrally challenging subject matter in films such as jesus camp the god who wasn t there what would jesus buy or the soon to be released religulous maybe robert whitlow s book is better
i have read the whole a wrinkle in time book and then saw the movie the movie contained all the elements in the book but since the book was pages and the film was hours it felt really crammed in with too many effects and bad acting a wrinkle in time is about a girl named meg charles wallace and calvin must team together to find meg s father and get off the island camazotz the beginning of the film is really a stinker the acting is awful the direction is laughable and so far the situations aren t necessary i really was crushed to see the same person madeleine engle that wrote the book and created the movie made a great book and a terrible film the acting is worse than any straight to video acting yes i got to admit there was cool effects but seriously they were all done terribly and not serial in any way possible if you read the book you will be crushed by the movie i wish could give it a but sadly i can only give it a half could have been useful
all i can say after watching snitch d is please stop mr cahill it is painfully clear you have no understanding of what you make movies about if you insist on making movies about gangsters i urge you to do research it s comical to watch movies with absurd gangbangers that even sound more absurd when they speak i laughed at the part when mr cahill goes to a school with only students and proceeds to kick their butts in kung fu fashion this movie was tough as an after school special who had the idea to have hats worn that say where a particular gangbanger was from i suspect real gangbangers do not wear hats claiming there gang that would be stupid considering new laws that add length to a prison term if a person is gang related snitch d is the worst gangbanger movie ever made
oh god what a horrible horrible film meant to be a comment on the state of society it s just a reflection of the worst of the worst in reality tv interstitials hosted by jason jones and don mckellar are the most obnoxious part written in a tone that is perhaps meant to be reflexive and insightful rather these moments are mind numbing as they speak to the camera with dialogue written by someone with a love for insulting condescending speech that shoves the meaning of the film down the viewer s throat also a point to would be filmmakers long takes and quiet scenes do not equal art neither do extreme angles or logic stretched to the point of absurdity if anyone out there is interested in watching this film please don t seriously please you have better things to do
prom night is an ok horror movie but prom night is way better and this movies about how the prom queen mary lou in gets killed by her boyfriend and comes back years later for revenge the best actor in this movie is micheal ironside and the movie stars other ok actors and actress like justin louis i wendy lyon lisa schrage and richard monette i and there are some good gore scenes like when mary lou kills the girl that is trying to hide in her locker by crushing the lockers together and how one of the students are on the computer and mary lou electrocutes him to death over all this is an ok good horror movie and my rating is out of
this is a terrible remake of a marginal but well liked movie from the early s i have seen the original at least times the version is a minute movie crammed into hours or whatever the runtime is cheesy storyline which by the way is completely different than the original the major government involvement was far fetched there is no flow from one scene to the next in the original you could go get a beer or hit the bathroom and still keep up it only took a few hours movie time to change the oil pan on the car it takes many times longer than that in real life car guys notice this stuff also the fool or fools that chose to trash a charger and abuse a challenger should be shot in the heel with a dull bullet the fact they aren t car people is painfully obvious and their passing will not be grieved the actors lacked any emotion everything was cut and dried one step above a monotone a barmitzvah is more exciting and energetic last but surely not least the radio dj made the statement that the challenger hit the bulldozers at or that is total garbage can you say aerodynamics or lack thereof hahahaha this movie is a joke don t waste your time watching this one
a badly acted two character comedy drama abruptly transmogrifies into a weren t we awful to the indians polemic with lousy special effects exploitative use of nudity and ugly violence it s as sincere as a politician s handshake as obvious as a car salesman s pitch one of the worst movies in the history of the universe absolute and utter dreck
the trailers get you to the movie but the movie just wasn t worth my it has some good effects but the storyline yech i like tommy lee jones and will smith as actors they have both done some good films but i wish they hadn t added this one to their resume s to be honest the book is better
misty ayers had a smoking body and that s all this movie was about pure exploitation flick i started playing a game with myself counting the number of times they looped the stock orchestral music and of course the music is completely unrelated to the scenes case in point casually walking into a room and saying hello was scored with chase music from a roman epic i d like to know why this film sat on the shelf for years before being released what i learned from this movie that women s low rise panties existed in i m talking sigourney weaver in the original alien movie panties at least of the first minutes is misty leisurely taking off and putting on her clothing except for bra and panties sadly also includes horrendous dubbing leading to a look out godzirra effect
even though there s a repertoire of over films to choose from this succubus is often named as the best jess franco film heck even the legendary filmmaker fritz lang counts succubus among his personal favorites so maybe it s me but i thought this was a dreadfully boring and overly confusing movie the opening is great though and shows janine reynaud performing an sm act on stage it s all downhill from here unfortunately reynaud s character is a maneater who eventually kills her lovers in some sort of trance franco had a decent budget to work with and spends it well on nice locations beautiful photography and a mesmerizing musical score this could have been his greatest film indeed if it wasn t for the lame and uninteresting story it s supposed to be psychedelic but i d say sophomoric is a better term to describe what s shown here half of the time you don t have a clue what s going on or what exactly is said so even the short running time of minutes seems to last ages this most certainly isn t franco s best film according to me i wouldn t even recommend it to die hard exploitation fans if you re looking for more superior jess franco film try to get your hands on las vampiras the awful dr orloff or female vampire
unless you re twelve this movie really isn t worth it it s obviously a low budget film with b actors and with a genre like fantasy that sometimes requires intense cgi work that s not good i knew it would be bad when i rented it i enjoy laughing at bad movies i didn t know how bad though it s bearable until after hour then it really starts to burn fighting styles go between normal fighting that obey the laws of physics and wire fighting there s no real explanation for the transitions it has a plot but once again it s obviously a kid s movie it seems like there are explicit moral lessons of the day that are being conveyed like sesame street or something it s bearable but much better if you re say nine
painful painful is the only word to describe this awful rendition of such a fun and interesting shakespearean play i gave it a shot but was terribly disappointed and couldn t bare to even finish viewing it to the person who wrote a novel about how wonderful this twist of much ado was i pity you and your bored brain may your pretenses about young viewers be lifted without retribution please do not even bother with this gut wrenching disgusting excuse for a performance of an acclaimed shakespeare drama you will be forced to induce vomiting and will require a commode close to the television with which you choose to watch this crap because involuntary defecation will take place
i saw this movie a couple years back i could nt sleep and there was nothing on so i peeped it what really gets me is it makes no sense and thats why its disturbing richard gets tied up in chicken wire and jarvis starts making out with richard s girl while she s unconscious then jarvis s buddy troubador is playing some stupid song on his guitar by the next morning it shows richard s girl talking to jarvis and trouby and then she walks back to richard and looks at him while he s still tied up then they play some happy music and the movie is finished i mean what happened did they brake up and what was she saying to those guys trouby and jarvis its to puzzling and to poor to i can t stand movies that are disturbing and don t make sense this was the worst film i ve ever seen since the s version of lord of the flies
a different look at horror the styling differences between american and russian films is interesting however from my american perspective this movie just wasn t that good the protagonist marie played by anastasia hille wasn t a pleasant character and i had a hard time identifying with her she was disagreeable most of the time and confused for much of what little time was left also too much time was spent in bringing her to the main location of the film then a long time passed before any real suspense built up once that happened it seemed volume was used as the main effect which was more annoying than anything else the concept was more original than most direct to video movies and they didn t use sex to make up for a thin plot all in all i d recommend it for renting but not for theater goers
oh dear jerry may be the undisputed king of talkshow but the movies are a whole different ball game and he s way out of his league the script for this film is so poor it has to be seen to be believed and its sad to see such vaguely familiar actors as michael dudikoff s action b movie king michael jai white last seen in the sci fi flop spawn as well as surviving the games william macnamara who is involved in the only half funny situation in the whole film stoop this low for employment if you are a fan of jerry then stick to his tv show as this is a total waste of and hour and a half after i had finished sitting through this i managed to catch the last half an hour of rocky on tv which looked like a cinematic masterpiece in comparison i think that says more than enough
a killer wearing a plastic white mask and black overcoat is killing the friends of hollywood producer shawn banning danny wolske who inherited his position when someone sliced open his former employer from crotch to chest perhaps the psychopath is newly hired maddy dabbie rochon an attractive raven haired beauty with a troubled family past plagued with nightmares shawn and his friends play a practical joke on maddy concerning a supposed murder club they started where each member randomly selected a victim to kill when maddy accidentally murders a woman in a parking garage because of a dent put into her car by this person she finds that shawn s pals were jerking her chain but shawn and his comrades are concerned about maddy s admittance towards committing the murder and contemplate turning her into the proper authorities deciding to wait on a definite decision each member fall prey to the white masked psycho with maddy a suspect considering the fact that she already has killed before or is someone else behind these murders low budget slasher executive produced by charles band with gore murders that fail to convince plenty of tits on display and allen nabors goofy character chris might entertain those with low expectations the murders include a stomach being opened with intestines showing a neck sliced an electrical cord thrown into a pool frying a female victim who had all day to escape an ax buried into the back of a male victim and to top it all a couple are strangled by a rope during their sexual climax for added effect the killer uses the breaker bar of a socket wrench as extra leverage to twist the rope as tight as possible snapping their necks there are enough plot holes to drive a truck through such as why maddy has nightmares of murders she didn t commit how she could murder someone so violently with blood all over her winding up waking in her bed without leaving something at the scene of the crime that would easily implicate her and how shawn could go so long allowing her to continue working at the company despite what she told regarding the murder she committed and a continual desire to join the supposed club that doesn t exist what bothered me the most was the film s desire for having us somehow sympathizing with this female protagonist who wanted to join a club after killing someone later proclaiming it to be an accident the film builds maddy as the potential psycho throughout because of her past her family disowned her for an abortion she has black outs and always appropriately winds up at the scenes of crimes after the fact in a lot of slashers the one who seems the most likely killer is often the red herring but this film goes out of it s way to point the finger at maddy when the twist occurs we re left rooting for maddy yet we know she s not right in the head it s a tough sell caring for this chick she does look great in a man s army shirt though and rochon isn t afraid to let her puppies breathe either low budget horror fans will get a kick out of seeing cult favorite brinke stevens as a religious fanatical mother who preaches against what maddy did calling her a murderer as beloved troma producer lloyd kaufman is the aloof father who can not get in a word edge wise to protect the daughter he truly cares about cult siren julie strain has a minor cameo showing her tits of course as the opening murdered male s girlfriend getting her head crushed by a hammer oh and check out the office for which shawn works you ll see a lot of full moon posters and art work spread throughout the walls
relentlessly stupid no budget war picture made mainly to show off the attributes of the spectacular eve meyer not a bad idea in itself but that should be an embarrassment to everyone connected with it laughable script performances that wouldn t pass muster in an elementary school christmas pageant inept action scenes confused direction by the normally competent documentary director louis clyde stoumen who is apparently not quite sure if he s making a comedy a philosophical treatise on the futility of war or a leering t a by early s standards anyway travelogue of eve meyer s magnificent body and a general air of shoddiness and incompetence worth seeing in order to watch eve meyer strut her stuff but that s pretty much it
this is quite possibly the worst movie i have ever seen again i made the mistake of buying the movie because the synapse on the back sounded cool and the front cover looked pretty cool too after buying this and the movie malevolence which i reviewed on here as well i have learned my lesson i love horror movies that take place in the woods or in the desert or on a farm this supposedly takes place in the woods of texas but was probably filmed in the director s backyard the production was probably the worst i ever seen the actors were absolutely the worst the story didn t have anything to do with what the back cover said i even tried to sell it to f y e and some other mom and pop store that buys used dvds and neither would take it thats how awful this poor miserable excuse for a movie was i have seen some bad movies before troll for example but this definitely takes the cake i didn t think there was a worse movie than troll boy was i wrong do not buy this movie unless someone hands it to you for free but even than your stuck with it unless you throw it out which is what i am about to do
i saw this a couple of nights back not expecting too much and unsurprisingly it didn t deliver anything too exciting the plot set up of a crew of vampire hunters v san for vampire sanitation going around in their spaceship periodically killing space vamps and rescuing people is quite sound and had the film been handled better it might well have been something quite ace unfortunately after a fairly decent opening the sense of actual quality starts to drain away from the film leaving something behind that though vacantly watchable is quite laughably bad i don t expect anything too special from these films that pop up on the sci fi channel and at least this wasn t one of their creature features with an atrocious cgi beast shambling about but it was still pretty bad mostly due to the writing and acting but with a sterling contribution to the overall badness made by the horrible music when the film opted just for a typical science fiction sounding weird noises approach to the soundtrack it did ok but all too often hilariously bad soft rock intruded and pitched scenes into silliness i would have tolerated the general cheesy acting and writing more were it not for the choice of music which was a serious miscalculation turning things from cheesy to lamely comical of the acting dominic zamprogna was ok but bland as the nominal hero whilst leanne adachi was pretty irritating as the tough girl of the vamp busting team and aaron pearl played another member who wasn t well written or interesting enough to make an impression though she didn t seem that good at the acting lark natassia malte did well through having a less irritating character than the others and the fact that she is seriously nice to look at the only serious name in the cast is michael ironside and he is underused though he does nicely pretty amusing in a manner one suspects was intentional he seems to have fun and earn his paycheck and his role is entertaining the effects are ok on the whole they are at least of the standards of the average science fiction tv show and there are also a few scenes of blood splatter and a bit of fun gore as well things move along nicely and i almost feel harsh rating this film badly but then i remember bursting into laughter at regular intervals and realising that unless the film is an intentional comedy which i don t think it is then it simply doesn t succeed too much is lame daft unconvincing its an ok effort i guess but it didn t appeal to me only give it a go if you really dig sci fi trash or unintended chuckles i d say
my thoughts on the movie it was not good not good at all visually it was great i was pleased with the pacing the camera angles etc however the characters eh kinda bland plot it sucked this movie seemed more new age crap than anything else organized religion is presented as cowardly and fearful science isn t portrayed any better it creates a monster weapon that kills everything but souls have the power to destroy monsters and bring life really that s something that bites my ass a bit too here we have a cgi movie created with science and they re using it to give us the message that science will destroy the world while promoting the idea that spirituality will save us at least they had the decency to have one of the characters ask okay so now what or something similar i couldn t hear it too well because of the crowd immediately getting up and making a break for the exit it was a okay it was just barely entertaining enough to sit here for the entire movie but now let s get out of here as fast as possible type of exit this is one of those movies where you can t think if you want to enjoy it just look at the visuals and nod your head prettily any thought as to what s the point of that will suck you out of disbelief and make you eye the exit sign with longing okay spoilers follow so basically a scientist creates the machine that is capable of creating other intelligent robotic life evil humans use it as a weapon however the scientist realizes that he is also at fault he gave the machine his intellect but didn t give it his heart the machine goes skynet on humanity s collective ass and wipes out all life on earth finally slowly powering down however the scientist manages to survive and create walking sock puppets each one containing a piece of the scientist s soul the last one wakes up not knowing anything about the world he sees a strange device nearby and picks it up he meets up with another like himself well gets captured by a last surviving robot of the machine finds more like himself ands sets off to rescue they succeed notices that there is a matching hole that fits the device perfectly he inserts it and the machine comes back to life pulling out s soul in the process the movie then continues with action scenes with trying to rescue his soul yanked compatriots they eventually succeed and destroy the machine they release the souls of their fallen friends who go up into the clouds it then rains and we see life returning back to the planet hunh that makes no sense none at all why the heck did the scientist want to split his soul into homunculi what did it accomplish were they created to stop the machine everything is dead the machine was dead why bother why did he expect nine little critters to succeed when nothing else had why not create a second intellectual machine but with a soul to fight the first at least that would have seemed like it would have had a reasonable chance at success why did they have to have their souls sucked into the device by the machine and then destroy the machine and then release the souls in order to bring life back to earth why not just wait for the machine to power down and bring life back without all the rest of the insane steps
as an army veteran i was deeply offended by this film in my opinion it is a disgrace to those who fought in the vietnam war to say that the real sf soldiers i knew were offended by this crap is an understatement if the film were presented as satire or even as a cartoon it was it would have been better received but it was taken seriously my many people especially overseas silly as it sounds wherever i went in europe in the late s people seemed to judge me and americans in general by this film unrealistic hmm let s see a monosyllabic muscle bound cretin is pulled off a prison work gang to go on a secret mission to se asia to free some american pow s in a running battle he kills about enemy soldiers with an m machine gun that never runs out of ammo and never overheats and he never misses running with a lb gun held up with one arm i could go on but i m getting a headache i gave this a only because it s slightly better than rambo iii
this movie was so badly written directed and acted that it beggars belief it should be remade with a better script director and casting service the worst problem is the acting you have jennifer beals on the one hand who is polished professional and totally believable and on the other hand ri chard who is woefully miscast and just jarring in this particular piece peter gallagher and jenny levine are just awful as the slave owning and keeping couple although both normally do fine work the actors and director should not have attempted to do accents at all they are inconsistent and unbelievable much better to have concentrated on doing a good job in actual english the casting is ludicrous why have children of an african merchant thus less socially desirable to the gens de couleur society been cast with very pale skinned actors while the supposedly socially desirable marcel has pronounced african features including an obviously dyed blond fro it s as if the casting directors cannot be bothered to read the script they are casting and to chose appropriate actors from a large pool of extremely talented and physically diverse actors of color it s just so weird this could be a great movie and should be re made but with people who respect the material and can choose appropriate and skilled actors there are plenty of good actors out there and it would be fun to see how jennifer beals daniel sunjata and gloria reuben would do with an appropriate cast good script and decent direction
closer to reality and containing more depth than breakdance stan lathan s beat street is still a pretty dull show again this pic is really only cashing in on the breakin craze but at least we get a little bit of entertainment from the plot which concerns the lives of three young friends and a younger brother all growing up in queens new york each has their own unique talent one is a hustler one a d j another an artist who creates burners while little bro lee is a hot hip hop dancer lathan is unable to generate any real audience interest in the story though and his young cast are likewise struggling with their characters therefore it is left almost entirely to the funky music and the fresh dancing to save the day choreography is again sharp for both club and street scenes but this alone is not enough to lift beat street to greater heights unfortunately the film really falls flat late on after showing a glimmer of hope that it just might get interesting sunday august video
mr perlman gives a standout performance as usual sadly he has to struggle with an underwritten script and some nonsensical set pieces larsen is in die hard mode complete with singlet and bulging muscles i m sure he could do better but seems satisfied to grimace and snarl through his part the lovely erika is very decorative even though fully clothed and shows some signs of getting acting at last sfx are mainly poor cgi and steals from other movies the shootouts are pitiful worthy of the a teamnot even worth seeing for perlman avoid

some gorehound friends recommended live feed to me and basically i can t really complain as the film certainly does deliver copious amounts of gross smut and buckets full of sleaze but it is of course not a very good film more than obviously cashing in on the latest trend in horror cinema the so called torture porn ryan nicholson tries to surpass every other film in this sub genre and that includes the role models hostel and saw with its sick twisted make up effects and thoroughly depraved shots of naked co eds tried up suffering and begging for their lives there s no actual plot to describe five utterly brainless twenty something friends take a trip to asia one of them has asian roots but other than that i don t really know why they opted to travel there instead of to cancun they re clearly not interested in the continents culture and even cause a hectic scene when they witness a local butchering a cute puppy dog on the market the quintet subsequently dives into the lurid night life and one of them accidentally insults the leader of a criminal clan a simply apology clearly doesn t suffice as the gangster follow them into an adult theater and gradually subject all of them to vicious torture one girl has her breast impaled and another poor wench even has a poisonous snake shoved down her throat yikes live feed is surprisingly boring despite of all the bloodshed and the amateurish production values are quite difficult to overlook even if you re used to watching independent fan boy trash cinema like this the fat bloke depicted on the cover an oriental s m executioner is admittedly quite cool and he s also the most talented of the whole bunch because he at least keeps his mouth shut the entire time i wouldn t exactly recommend this pile of filth but hey if you like loud hideous metal music nauseating torture footage and dim witted losers go right ahead and watch
the film i ve been looking forward to for months was little more then a disappointment i was deeply surprised by s lack of story and strange character development all the awesome action sequences in the world don t make up for a single unsympathetic character the strange almost thrown in occult sequences were not only out of place they were infuriating the story is about robots and scientists why does it suddenly turn into a necronomicon horror wannabe with mystical symbols and green magic ghost lines instead of giving answers to what could have been excellently scary story devices how what when why questions that bode asking only if you care and it becomes less and less likely that you will as you get away from the theater a film like this is frustrating because of its lack of depth i would watch this film drawn in crayon if the story was good but the filmmakers have relied on cgi wizardry and tim burtons name to draw in the crowd which is what drew me in but failed to gain my respect could have been awesome with a few more rewrites and a little more respect from its own creators
this film is a huge steaming pile i have no idea why anyone felt that the garland mason version needed to be redone nor why striesand would have been a first choice to star for that matter i have no idea why our people gay americans tend largely to regard striesand as some kind of treasure at least in my opinion she had peaked professionally with with funny girl and bogdanovich s what s up doc do yourself a favor and rent the judy classic or even the original a fine film in its own right but please please please skip this stinkpot
this movie was terrible i rented it not knowing what to expect i watched the st minutes and the movie and knew it was a bomb the acting was bad and there was no plot the monster is soooooo fake it growls and its mouth doesnt move also why would they have a doctor playing a xylophone to kill the monster just plain bad don t even waste your time out of
i saw this movie a few months ago in the town which appeared as greendale in the movie which is the only reason i went to see it another local who was there just forwarded to me an email announcement of a repeat showing because the first had sold out and people were turned away his editorial comment in his forward is a good summary yuk unless you re a neil young fan or live in near greendale if the latter you know the real name skip this movie it s mostly an ego trip for the filmmaker it has no discernible plot the music is merely ok and too much of the lyrics are unintelligible making it impossible to follow what little shreds of plot there may be i don t need to put in a spoiler warning because there are no surprises to give away i d give this a but that s just for the amusement value of seeing the locales made into a movie it wasn t worth the i could rent a video camera and drive around greendale and make a better movie myself if you want to see a good environmental message movie with no plot go rent koyaanisqatsi
like wearing a hair shirt positively absolutely without a shadow of a doubt one of the worst movies ever pure torture zero stars out of ten one long tedious labored pretentious self conscious theatrical and leadenly artsy scene after another intended to be dreamlike and impressionistic the soul bared it is instead morose mush half naked father and son grope and whisper to each other like lovers homo erotic is the point loud and clear ok so what repeated more than once by the son is the line supposedly lifted from lives of the saints a father s love crucifies a loving son lets himself be crucified the parallel to god and his son christ is heavy handed irrelevant and bombastic like everything else here some reference points to the theme of russian filiality mother and son the return andrei zvyagvatsev little odessa james gray turgenev fathers and sons and of course dostoyevsky the brothers karamazov credits in english indicate intended international distribution meaning that the excuse cannot be used that you have to be russian to understand this mess this is nowhere near as accomplished or compelling as sokurov s last russian ark as in his mother and son an equally powerful soporific some scenes are filmed from distorting mirrors though not as interestingly the film is almost monochromatic shot from start to finish through beige filters making it as visually as it is dramatically numbing a soft focus haze only adds to the drugged feeling an annoying soundtrack drones on never shuts up like a tape loop an old radio constantly plays in the background russian romantic melancholy swells endlessly as themes based on tchaikovsky the presence of a sound designer sergei moshkov signifies of course that all those irritating little sounds radio static noises distortion and such are designed it s hard to believe someone sergei potepolov actually wrote this thing it all seems as arbitrary as traffic as if improvised by bored actors popping out of nothingness into nothingness modern art has finally succeeded in signifying the thing without being the thing so that what we behold is the idea of the idea empty as a shell but not even a shell merely the idea of a shell could one ask for a better definition of decadence
this is not a horror film but a boring sex movie a very bad movie to be avoided by any serious horror fan no plot awful acting and annoying music if you only watch the trailer you will know enough it s a shame that such thing is available on vhs or video while there are so many good movies unavailable if you like vampires try the hammer productions or the italian gothic from mario bava and antonio margheriti instead those are masterpieces if you compare this with this trash rating even is too much and believe me i am not the only one with this opinion
i had the mis fortune to see this film at a showing in the us having reluctantly sat through the entire abysmal thing i am shocked to have seen so many good reviews here on imdb the original film was a turkey but an interesting one it fitted into that early seventies post revolution thing this film just stinks of well nothing really it s that bad imagine a badly done perfume commercial see what i mean madonna never could act and has been an embarrassment on the big screen for years she looks worse and worse with every one of those years increasingly coming to resemble a skinned meerkat guy ritchie who has built his reputation on lock stock could never direct either his movies are shallow badly cut fashion shows he doesn t disappoint here either he wisely cast his wife as the star of this debacle please people take little heed of the good reviews this movie has received from other posters below they are quite obviously business plants don t encourage ritchie to humiliate himself further by giving him money
i don t like this film but then i didn t think much of the book either which although lauded by many as a masterpiece i found lacking in character development and disjointed and illogical in plot although it was far more readable than fante s dreadful first effort road to los angeles not published until fante became fashionable in the mid s i was intrigued to see what sort of soup towne would make with such meager ingredients he has worked hard script wise to repair the many shortcomings of the book but for my money didn t rescue it there was never a movie in ask the dust while ever he tried to stay faithful to the book i consider this film towne s folly in a word forgettable
what a horrible horrible film the worst collection of cliches i have seen in a long time not that i saw much i left the theatre screaming after about minutes in search of a stiff drink to soothe my nerves meryl streep was awful as usual how many hurt and tortured expressions can person have aidan quinn s talents were as so often totally wasted and who told gloria estefan she could act trying to be polically correct this movie still enforces racial stereotypes brave inexperienced lonely music teacher teaches underprivilegded kids violin in poor neighbourhood school the kids weren t even cute just written in to suit the appalling script aaargh wes craven really made me cringe for once real horror this one
i gave this stars out of a possible because the stories are open ended and left unexplained and because of the nauseating scenes of someone eating in an extremely disgusting way plus scenes of a decaying corpse neither of the above needed to be shown in such a graphic manner the film s plot such as it is concerns three loosely interconnecting stories none of which conclude satisfactorily the bounty hunter played by bruce dern is the character that connects all three vignettes first we have dylan mcdermott looking darn fine as a wanted criminal who is fleeing to mexico to escape both the law and the bounty hunter when he rides through a border town and spots a sad faced saloon girl played by helen hunt then we have one of the hemingway girls not sure which one playing a western wife out on the lonely frontier who goes over to see about a neighbor woman an attractive redhead whom we soon realize has been out in the badlands a little too long the conclusion of the film returns to the bounty hunter and what happens to him with the final scene in the film being completely beyond rational comprehension
i love watching early colour films you mean those s clothes weren t all grey margaret rutherford dominates this movie her eccentric garb is actually rather attractive and yes she has an amazing hourglass figure but i feel she was given her head rather too much she probably developed this characterisation over many performances and nobody told her if it gets a laugh leave it out she does too much deranged fooling about when she s supposed to be surprisingly down to earth the madame arcati joke is that mediums were usually portrayed as wispy females in long drapery arcati behaves like a retired headmistress we ll really put our backs into it the contrast between her breezy commonplace manner and her wacky beliefs isn t really brought out just because all the actors are english apart from cummings the americans feel they have to use the words brit stiff lip and upper oh give it a rest the three main characters lose their tempers constantly and make risqu remarks did he make love to you yes but very discreetly he was in the cavalry
just what we need another remake of vintage hollywood cinema with eddie murphy miscast again in his second time around after the nutty professor this shows why we re running out of special ideas in making a quality movie ladies and gentlemen it has some signs of hope for its likeable and delightful imagery of animals who can act and speak with humans things can only get more worse unfortunately bathroom jokes and sexual references kill this piece of family funfare instantly even parents and children saw the trailer ad on the family channel which was followed by utter angst and disgust in the movie theater sad to say this is the more progressive pre millennium era but enjoy it while it lasts cause things can only get worse with time more went wrong with the all new dr dolittle it is absolutely plotless feeling too flat i also hate that irritating voice of chris rock we need more talented voice overs than a bunch of overpaid celebs who don t want to declare bankruptcy i ll have to agree on my local newspaper giving this among the top five worst movies of then again the original version wasn t any good either murphy s next project could be patton if he s not careful
wow i can t believe people consider this a good movie now i have seen much worse but there are much more romantic funny comedies with john cusack this is a mediocre film at best while the acting wasn t terrible but not great for a romantic comedy there was little passion little romance there were many loose ends that don t show up or are not addressed unfortunately the main characters do come off as complete cowards they don t know themselves well enough to realize that they don t love the people they are engaged to how do we know they aren t in love by the utter lack of remorse both characters have for leaving their finances i can think of few things more romantic than the continual escape from commitment that these two show the movie doesn t even end with a wedding scene more than likely both will get cold feet and drop each other like hot potatoes once a commitment is nearing this movie is really about two people who can t commit to anything unlike cusack s previous characters who were more than willing to make a deep commitment loyd in say anything martin in grosse pointe blank etc the greatest failure of this movie was the complete lack of any twists turns or anything of interest when the movie ended i felt like they had failed to include a climax to the story which basically fits the whole movie boring no suspense about whether the two will end up together no joy when they do no consequences to their actions it is sad that people are so blind to the shoddiness of this movie that they simply rebuke any criticism with everyone is too cynical criticism of this movie is not cynicism simply unbiased examination there are many other better romantic comedies even ones with grace kelly or eva marie saint if you think this movie is great try these movies you hearts will explode the princess bride say anything grosse pointe blank high fidelity keeping the faith charade rear window north by northwest or there s something about mary which is a good examination of idealized romance vs today s society
the film starts to slowly when we got to the cinema we thought it looked quite good but after about mins we were all bored out of our minds and wondering what kind of film we had come to see i don t like this film and wouldn t recommend it to anyone the best part of the night was when the alarm and lights came back on because the project broke down because we thought we could all go home this has to be one of the worst films i have ever seen we were all bored out of or minds and most of the people in the cinema actually ran out of the doors at the end because it was so rubbish i am surprised that no one walked out earlier than that if you go and see it make sure you something to keep you busy better still don t go and see it at all
okay i ve watched this movie twice now i have researched it heavily on the net i have asked several people on there opinions i have even gone to the length of reading the original sheridan lafanu classic carmilla a book that this movie is supposed to be based on i feel that the best way to review this movie is to describe a game to play whilst watching it as the plot of the movie doesn t seem to make any sense at all here is the plot of the book laura lives in a castle in syberia with her father mr de lafontaine they carry on with their lives blissfully and peacefully one day they get a letter from the general a man who has made it his mission in life to avenge his daughters death he makes claims of supernatural powers being at work and explains that he will visit them soon meanwhile a chance encounter with a strange woman results in the lafontaines looking after her daughter carmilla for several months soon laura starts to be overwhelmed by strange dreams and begins to come down with a strange illness who is this mysterious carmilla and just what has she to do with laura s condition and the general i have invented this game and would like as many people as possible to play it and let me know what their results are i even have a catchy name and would have a jingle too but i can t be bothered with that it s called the this movie doesn t make any sense game all you have to do is whilst watching the movie try to come up with a complete plot that explains what is happening i mean complete all questions answered everything makes sense absolutely complete it will have to answer such questions as why can vampires walk around in day light why are they all lesbians why is a girl called bob and why does she shoot herself when is the movie a dream and when is it real why does killing zombies appear to be an accepted part of life that doesn t make anyone bat an eyelid why does travis fontaine spot and run down a zombie without slowing down whilst driving his car yet when faced with a woman with an obvious hostage in the back of her car accept the excuse that she is a zombie too and why does he then let a girl which he later openly reveals that he knows is the head vampire drive with him in his car and then let her drive off alone with his daughter in a stolen car what the hell is the asylum scene all about what the hell is the green goo all about why does the head vampire suddenly start dressing like a nurse why are there never any vampires fighting zombies what is the significance of the necklace what is it made of why does it kill vampires and how does jenna know that in fact sod it it s just as much fun trying to come up with as many questions about this movie too i have my plot and i have to admit it is not quite there but it is a pretty good effort in conclusion vampires vs zombies has no moment in it where there are actually vampires fighting zombies everyone in the movie seems to know exactly what is going on yet they seem very reluctant to let the audience in on this and somehow it is based on a classic th century horror novel how why what the hell is going on
this is a very bad western mainly because it is historically inaccurate it looks as if it were shot on a back lot in california instead of where jack slade lived and died idaho colorado territories and montana it fictionalizes everything that is known about this mysterious bad man good man the script is horrible there is very little direction and lousy acting dorothy malone is completely wasted as his wife mark steven never seems to know how to portray this mysterious jack slade in real life jack slade was a very good stage line superintendent he was feared by his local townsmen for his hard drinking when drunk he would start fights and cause other problems in virginia city montana to insure that he could never terrorize them again vigilantes lynched jack slade after he ignored their warning to leave town immediately this is a horrible movie i can not recommend anyone to watch this movie other than to see how hollywood butches history at will even to this day
this movie seems to send the wrong message there can be morality without using christ poeple of other religions i believe can get into heaven i am a catholic who goes to church every week but i do not agree with such christian arrogance this is the worst time travel movie i have ever seen and i ve seen timeline
washington square is a flat shabby adaptation of the short novel by henry james indeed the novel is very good but far from the level of james masterpieces moreover its simple eventless story seems unsuited to make it into a film although william wyler with his the heiress gave in a beautiful version of the novel anyway the movie completely betrays the spirit of this work of the great american writer in the novel the heroine catherine is shy not very attractive and somewhat clumsy but nonetheless she is a sound intelligent young woman and she s not as naive as it may seem her attachment for her father is dignified and respectful with no morbid sides in it along three quarters of the movie catherine jennifer jason leigh just seems to be mentally retarded poor thing in the last quarter she suddenly and incredibly becomes intelligent aware of her dignity as a woman and all that the director agnieszka holland has added two vulgar scenes to the story the first when the nervous child catherine has well troubles with her vesica the second scene when we see on the background a sort of open air brothel with prostitutes taking their customers behind tents and so on nothing could be more contrary to the spirit and artistic ideals of henry james it is notorious that the writer was extremely decent and demure even for the standards of the victorian age i defy anyone to find any coarseness anywhere in the thousands of pages of james huge literary production i really was particularly annoyed by these two scenes yes i know that a director needs reasonable freedom in the screen adaptation of a novel but if a director utterly ignores or misunderstands the art of an author here henry james i don t see the point of using his work to make a bad movie the acting is adequate to the movie poor and flat in spite of the talent of albert finney and maggie smith washington square is definitely a non recommendable film
there s a major difference between releasing an original intense edge of your seat scary gore fest and doing like filmmaker eli roth and his team have done with cabin fever and simply acted like it the film follows five college graduates into a cabin in the woods that begins to prove fatal as one after the other succumbs to this mysterious fast acting flesh eating disease it s not long before the friends turn on one another and can barely stand the sight of one another much less want to be in the same vicinity as them as gross as it all sounds there s a certain spark behind the basic premise of this film that could have worked in the hands of a less cocky filmmaker unfortunately what we end up with is poorly drawn characters whose sole purpose seems to be to look beautiful at the beginning to make the inevitable decomposition more contrasting a hackneyed script so profanity laden as to leave the viewer tuning out the dialogue and several incomprehensible subplots that motivate little more than in one instance an on screen appearance by director roth this is sloppy film making in several ways avoid this time devourer
who could possibly have wished for a sequel to bert i gordon s legendary bad trash film food of the gods nobody of course but director damien lee thought it was a good idea anyway and he put together a belated sequel that stands as one of the most redundant movies in horror history gnaw is a sequel in name only as the setting moved to a typical late s location a university campus and also the cheap cheesy gore effects perfectly illustrates the s this script hangs together by clich s awfully written dialogs and plot situations that are not so subtly stolen from other and more successful horror classics neil hamilton is a goody two shoes scientist who performs growing experiments on ordinary rodents in order to do a fellow scientist a favor due to some incredibly stupid animal rights activists the huge and ravenous rats escape and devour pretty much everyone on campus following the good old tradition that spielberg s jaws started there s an obnoxious dean who refuses to admit the problem even though severely mutilated corpses are turning up everywhere during a hysterically grotesque climax the rats invade the opening ceremony of the campus new sport complex gnaw food of the gods is terribly bad and therefore a lot of fun to watch the characters do and say unimaginably stupid stuff like descending into the sewers unarmed while they know it s infested with rats the acting is atrocious and there s a genuinely bizarre sequence involving the hero having sex under the influence of growth serum i wonder what freud s theory would be on that there s a satisfying amount of gore and sleaze and it has to be said the music is surprisingly atmospheric in case you just can t get enough of this junk there are quite a lot of creature features revolving on mutated rats like the italian schlock film rats night of terror the modest s cult film willard and its lame sequel ben the willard remake starring crispin glover and the surprisingly good recent rat movies by once famous directors tibor ticaks rats and john lafia the rats go nuts
r zone is an awful movie it is so simple it seems they tried to make a movie to show the reel life just like zappa did many years ago but unfortunately denmark lacks good young actors leon are by many still the little girl in krummernes jul and laura is simply not good enough to play such an important role several times in the movie she plays with out soul and this is destroying the movie even though i consider it a movie you ought to see i do not agree that the youth are behaving like this but i think it can show how it can end if you are letting your child down also it is important to support danish movies and new companies like film folket all in all i think people should see r zone not because it is a great film but because it is a movies which is dealing with important themes i also think it is important to point out that there are some violent scenes in it and actually it is in these scenes laura is acting best like the ending where she is holding the gun
this movie is such a bad work nothing seems to even try and be realistic plot is weak acting miserable actors wondering around like in a st year production trying very hard to act with no chance at all from the beginning what a flop what a waste of time money and effort to all concerned including the audience well as in any thriller here too are murders corpses and blood just imagine someone who minutes ago committed a murder with a knife and came out calm and smiling not to mention clean as a whistle as if slashing one s throat is done by a virtual agent also this murder was supposed to be done by a tiny fragile woman on a high strong male and she cut his throat did she ask him politely to bend down for her much more stupidity of that same kind is going on and on leaving the audience wondering if this meant to be a joke which just turned out to be a bad one continuity is another huge problem as for instance the eager hungry groom is lying in bed waiting for his virgin bride to get out of the bathroom and after a long while falls asleep next scene opens with the young couple entering the reception area asking for guidance to scenery spots not a word about last night such a waste of time even to try and write about this low low supposed to be movie
nothing can prepare you for another lousy bimbo outing this time it s being brought to you by the never inevitable fred olen ray as far as exploitation movies go this one doesn t click as science fiction it s plain unoriginal all that we see is an an ugly feminine android wearing a bikini out to destroy the earth and showing off all that s nearly bare to resist give me a f ing break if this kind of entertainment is your thing then why not dust off those old si swimsuit mags from the attic for a change this would have been much better if it didn t set the sleaze factor on very high but that still wouldn t make this one great i d like to point out another film called the assault by jim wynorski which resembles the identity of alienator it illustrates why top notch st person femme fatale action movies don t translate well in america sorry fellas
if you want to know what kind of music white people listened to in this is the movie for you but you ll have to listen to a lot of flutes and violins too see my remarks on my girl for the reference indulgent admission i approached my girl with cynicism and annoyance having just viewed its predecessor but as an adoptee preparing to finally set upon a search for my birthmother my girl made me look with its theme of searching for mother put another way anything i liked about my girl had nothing whatsoever to do with my girl but relating to a protagonist who asks like so many adoptees who s my mama and if there are home movies of my mom in an acting troupe i ll be sure to make my own movie about it people are listless movies should not be listless my girl like my girl is just listless avoid unless you re a complete sap who s comforted by a series of small annoyances
the main reason people still care about carlton browne of the f o is that it features peter sellers in a second billed role but watching this film to see peter sellers is a mistake sellers plays amphibulos a vaguely reptilian prime minister of the dirt poor island nation of gaillardia formerly a british colony now hosting a lot of russian diggers during the height of the cold war amphibulos wants to play both u k and soviet interests against each other for easy profit everything very friendly and all our cards under the table terry thomas is the title character a lazy british diplomat anxious to show gaillardia that great britain hasn t forgotten them all appearances to the contrary a positive review here says the reason this movie is considered average is because the comedy is understated i would argue that the reason carlton browne is considered below average is because the comedy is non existent after a decent opening that establishes the film s only two strengths a sympathetically doltish terry thomas and john addison s full on larky score things quickly slow down into a series of slow burns and lame miscommunication jokes the low opinion of carlton browne by his boss and the obscurity of gaillardia which no one can find on a map is milked to death by the time we actually reach the island after a labored series of airsick jokes expectations are quite low they re still too high though the island itself which seems to exist either in latin america or the mediterranean is so pathetic its honor guard faints at the airport and the review stand falls apart in the middle of a parade the army is apparently still horse drawn allowing for another lame aural gag by a thick accented announcer in war the army uses many horse sellers never quite takes center stage even when we re on his character s island the plot is taken over instead by ian bannen as king loris who inherits the throne of gaillardia after his father s assassination bannen is dull and plays his part as straight as it is written normally this would make him the likely target for scene stealing by sellers but trapped behind a thick accent and greasy moustache sellers is only a threat to those of us who remember him far more happily in two other films made this same year the mouse that roared and i m all right jack strange that this film like jack was a boulting brothers production with roy boulting here serving as co director alongside jeffrey dell usually boulting films combine wicked social satire with anything goes comedy but here there are only fey jabs in either direction amphibulos works his mangled english vibe for all its worth this man is like how do you say the bull in the chinese ship while carlton browne is generally ragged on by his superior far more than he seems to deserve the weakest and most protracted element of the film is young loris s romance with ilyena score one point for her being played by ravishing luciana paluzzi dock one for the fact that they are apparently cousins is never addressed the film winds up with a lamely staged revolution whose surprise resolution will surprise no one and a final bit of action by carlton browne that would seem to nail the lid on his coffin literally apparently he lives to see another day but the film of the same name is strictly doa
what s wrong with this film many many things the editing tries too hard to look good and does nothing but confuse the viewer whilst also supplying him her with a powerful headache the plot is muddled and obviously prolonged from what started as a short story or film the plot only makes for less than ten minutes of good story and this is just stretched out painfully until it reached the minimum length for a feature film we all know what happens to things when we stretch them right exactly they get thinner in the end the plot is just so paper thin that you might even miss it if you aren t paying attention which is hard to do when watching this movie the acting is not even slightly impressive the characters are poorly written and dull uninteresting one of the worst things that are wrong with this film is that apparently whoever was in charge of the score soundtrack had no idea what the movie was or what it was supposed to be about not that i blame him i couldn t figure it out either as a result half of the music in the film doesn t fit the scenes at all also what was with all the sexual undertones between eliza dushku and the main character naturally this was in order to attract young males but it was just so cheaply done and did the first scene have anything to do with the rest of the film on any conceivable level at all the two creepy guys didn t seem to have anything to do with the film at all they were just there in order to have some chase scenes i doubt anyone would really enjoy a film so poorly put together and such a shameless and awful hollywood like attempt at a somewhat interesting idea but i digress i recommend this to teenagers with low attention spans who don t mind a really bad horror thriller as long as there s some sex and gore in it although that may only be true for the killer cut which i saw
cassidy kacia brady puts a gun in her mouth blowing the back of her head out on boyfriend neal jason dibler cassidy was the lead singer of a demons and death rock band who couldn t shake the sad feelings of her boyfriend s neglect towards her you know i can find other reasonable ways to solve this other than putting a bullet through your head she returns however possessing the soul of dora jill small her friend who is to replace her on vocals so that the group can finish the album halted by cassidy s untimely death but cassidy made a deal with the dark one and souls are to be collected she s consumed by this anger towards mainly neal but all the band members or anyone within the music studio get dead when they fall prey to whom they believe is a rather distraught dora not cassidy returning for payback lousy micro budget horror flick looks cheap has a cheap cast who should make plans in another line of work and boasts cheap kill scenes which aren t effective one bit
back when i was a kid and i lived with my sister she bought every horror movie she could find and this was one of them vcr s had just became a household item and we didn t have but about movies and we watched the hell out of all of them i was at a yard sale the other day and i saw this vhs copy of blood legacy and i buy any horror movie i don t have and i knew this movie looked familiar i thought for a second and realized it was one that my sister had bought she had sold it years ago in a yard sale i am guessing who knows i didn t recall anything at all about it and i watched it the night i bought it and it refreshed my memory because of a few scenes i am not sure how i felt about it as a kid but i am sure i enjoyed it because it was new to me and i d watch and enjoy anything back then i am a horror freak but there are certain requirements in order for me to consider it good and this one fell very short it was one of those talk talk talk and bore me to death types what death scenes you see are done using the shadow on the wall followed by blood splatter and thats if you re lucky you get that much the story is good and i have seen a few with similar plots so i think this one should be buried and forgotten don t watch this people unless you re hard up
well finally got to see the remake last night in london unintentionally hilarious sexless and devoid of any real humour i don t really know where to start whilst i was entertained by this strange homage it didn t really move me the acting is screamingly hammy there is no original music the costumes are far too disney there is a ridiculous six months later insert after the burning of nic cage which didn t come soon enough for my liking the bit with cage in the bear suit had the audience suppressing mirth as did the comedy punching out of various baddies on the island it s such a weird remake that i cant quite believe i saw it it reminded me of something that the comic strip presents would have done in the eighties a bit like their hollywood interpretation of the miner s strike very strange
i hate to even waste the time it takes to write lines on this atrocity hyung rae shim is lucky that bad film making isn t a capital crime or he d be put to death twice for writing and directing this disaster i m amazed that this film had a m budget but actually glad in the sense that it was such a tremendous flop that shim will hopefully never get to make another movie the rest of the life and therefore not waste any more of filmgoers time i would think the actors would have gotten together and lynched him by now with the effects resources available to them a great film could have been made with this budget as usual the failure should have been spotted at the very beginning with the terrible script and story transformers was another visual feast with a weak script but this makes it look like citizen kane
the return of chandu is notable if one can say that for the casting of bela lugosi as the hero rather than the villain why he even gets the girl the story as such involves the black magic cult of ubasti trying to capture the last egyptian princess nadji the delectable maria alba and use her as a sacrifice as a means of reviving their ancient leader who just happens to look like nadji lugosi as chandu who possesses magical powers tries to thwart the villains director ray taylor does his best with limited resources and extensive stock footage fans of king kong will recognize the giant doors that were used to keep kong at bay in several scenes the acting is for the most part awful the actor who plays the high priest i believe lucien prival for example uses that acting coach inspired pronunciation that was so common in the early talkies the less said about the others the better it is a mystery why lugosi accepted parts in independent quickies at this stage of his career because he was still a bankable star at universal at this time maybe it was because in this case he got to play the hero and get the girl who knows as his career started to spiral downwards in the late s this kind of fare would become the norm for lugosi rather than the exception
i wasn t at all a fan of the gore fest hit hostel and most of these lame ass knock offs are just as bad or worse yet live feed managed to keep me somewhat entertained for about the first minutes started off with plenty of sex and sleazy settings followed by some good death scenes involving the chinese organized crime squad and a foot leather aproned butcher what put me out of the movie was the tough hero with the guns and a grudge saving the day i would call this movie mediocre at best since a premise mainly involving obnoxious young people being slaughtered in a seedy porno theater doubling as a hideout for the mafia is appealing to me if only the torture was prolonged enough to be thoroughly effective then my rating would have differed greatly unfortunately most of the gruesomeness is heaped together in one scene leaving the rest of the movie to conclude as a revenge type scenario so basically it is just a low budget hostel rip off with the redeeming use of gratuitous sex almost constant during the first half of the film overall i would say don t bother with this one
this is one of those movies that apparently was trying to ride the martial arts wave craze kind of like billy jack i guess however whereas billy jack did have one notable martial arts scene there are none in this one unless you consider some gentlemanly grappling and roughhousing as such we are introduced to the star who is described as having learned judo in the marines i was in the marines and while they are pretty established in boxing i really don t remember any emphasis on judo as a result the antagonist james macarthur makes reference to the judo when he offers an excuse for why he a state champion wrestler was so easily defeated lame
i don t know how to describe this movie it s definitely one of the weirdest movies i ve seen in a long time it is very unsettling at times but also boring in other places the scenes of dental torture are very elaborate and may attract anyone who s into gore splatter i found myself holding my teeth during some of the aforementioned scenes the clever thing about the movie is that it plays with our fears and the dentist is therefore quite unsettling the humor of the film is somehow hidden and may not be recognized by everyone but if you re a fan of weird and strange entertainment and teeth getting drilled to dust this is just the film you were looking for if you read the comment and feel somehow attracted by this kind of entertainment give it a try my rating maybe a little too weird for my taste
resnais wow the genius who brought us hiroshima mon amour takes on the challenge of making a s french musical in vibrant colour the opening voice over with old embellished inter titles was a nice touch then the camera aperture opens like the old hand crankers on a black white placard the camera backs off or rather up suddenly showing us the surprisingly brilliant colours of an elegant table set for a tea party this is all in the first seconds then the music starts a rather banal and forgettable diddy featuring an unconvincing chorus of girls blabbering some nonsense which has no relevance to the film and yes i speak french so i can t blame it on the subtitles those characters whiz out the door and are replaced by more people who break into an even more forgettable song then they leave and finally audrey tautou appears and we hear our first appreciable dialogue minutes into the film i m not sure what resnais intended by starting off with such a yawning waste of time musical cacophony but the effect on the viewer is to make you want to hurl skittles at the screen and storm out i endured it didn t get much better i ll tell you why there is absolutely no familiarity with any of the characters we don t even see their faces half the time as resnais seems too intent on showing off the expensive scenery to care about the actual people in front of the camera people flit on off stage like moths around a lamp and we the audience are unable to focus on any particular person or plot it s as if you were to take every episode of the brady bunch and cram it into a hour movie with bad songs the only thing that kept me watching as long as i did hour was that i was looking at the camera techniques lighting and scenery which were all i admit excellent but is that enough to hold your attention for hours not me maybe tomorrow i ll try watching the end aw who am i kidding i have more important things to do i m sure you do too skip this
bad acting bad writing this was a poorly written film it s too bad because it had some potential it s not even close to american pie or something about mary as previous comments might have you believe rent it at dollar night from you local video store if you re kind of bored
i watched this a few days ago so details are getting hazy the film is shot on hand held cameras and a lot was made of this at the time it was released originally since we hadn t had many studio pictures made in this way i can t help but feel this was more of a gimmick than anything designed to make the audience think that what we are seeing on the screen hasn t had all the compromises that come with a big budget and so was more real however what we have here isn t much more than a not as good rip off of the first half of full metal jacket so anyone who has seen that or any one of the other rip offs there of will know what to expect the main problem i had was the stereotyped characters with the weedy soft kids out of their depth close harmony singing ebonics spouting black dudes world weary sergeants bitter and twisted psychos etc etc all being put into the sorts of situations that would provide the most friction and tension at any given time maybe this was intentional to highlight the stupidity and injustice of the situation maybe it was laziness or maybe it was just a committee trying to appeal to the biggest audience all i know is it was annoying one novel thing was the mixture of volunteers and draftees where normally all the characters would have been forced into the situation although only the scenes between the two main characters really make much play of it this seems to be the main pivot of the plot with the volunteers coming to their senses and the draftees gaining a sense of duty and self worth but its all done in a rather forced and unsubtle way the other big bug i had was how all the characters with the exception of the psychos and the real softies would react to each inevitable conflict with at first aggression and threats of violence faced with farrell s ubiquitous stoicism immediately back down and be all reasonable and diplomatic i guess if i had to find a plus it would be the acting from the two leads which was strong and very convincing tho considering the formulaic nature of the characters this wasn t too hard in my imagination bozz grew up to be zeke off tour of duty and for my money episodes of that would be more fun to watch
it must be the most corniest tv show on the air this is probably a escape for jim belushi and all of his bad movies his brother sucked all the talent out he younger brother i hope this show is canceled and never spoken of again except in a negative use jim has got to retire or something please let them go of the air if i here a joke from that show i will throw up and and wash my eyes out with a toothbrush id rather be taken from the devil himself than watch a full half hour that piece of programing i still do not understand why the show is still in the air and running we all know deep down that we want to shoot our tv screens when we see jim s face in conclusion no more please
it was a m in the morning and i had nothing else to do don t judge me please we re back in time during the spanish settlements a group have made their way onto an island it doesn t take too long before they encounter a large reptile which gobbles up their horse soon they re captured by the natives and in order to gain freedom they must kill the reptile gods the cg sucks it reminds me of the cg of early console video games the encounters were lame the only positive thing i have to say about this was the hottie native running around in a skimpy outfit otherwise it s just a middling effort
i m both amused and disgusted by the people who claim that this movie is so accurate about vietnam and were never there this movie is about as true about the whole vietnam war as the rodney king beating is true about all police officers yes bad things do and did happen but in general the people there are just like you and me they have morals they are not killing machines they do not all do drugs atrocities were the exception in vietnam not the rule they happened far more infrequently than the hype would lead you believe oliver stone has a knack for making movies that show the vietnam war as this brutal bloodbath but are based as much in reality as star wars if you honestly believe the stereotypes of vietnam do yourself a favour and learn the truth fact the viet cong and nva did far worse things to the south vietnamese than any soldier in the us armed forces ever did fact the soldiers in world war ii treated the enemy far worse in general than the soldiers in vietnam did and they were welcomed when they came home the fine americans who served this country in vietnam deserve our respect though the war was badly fought from a political standpoint no one could have asked for more from our soldiers and it is a great disservice to assert that this kind of mostly true fiction is the way things really were there
after having watched koyaanisqatsi two or three dozen times and loving every second of it i finally had a chance to see it s sequel life in transformation i was truly dissappointed as it did not nearly stand up to the high standards of the first minutes of people with baskets on their head is not my idea of a good movie the philip glass score for this one had neither the beauty nor the correlating strength of the first compared with koyaanisqatsi this movie seemed slow and pointless a watered down version of baraka which is the same idea but done better i truly hope the third movie in this series will not follow the example of this waste
i normally do not take the time to make comments that few people will read about movies few will see however in this case i feel i must warn all those who might consider wasting time on it i just finished watching it only five minutes ago this is quite simply one of the worst movies that i have ever seen in my life the acting is horrible a plot is nonexistent and production values are poverty level at best i know that even a low budget movie can be great but not this one there is only thing that could have saved this movie for any horror fan s purposes more on screen gore and slashing the grand total of three times that this occurs is off screen while it is effective and reasonably disturbing when it happens especially the end scene there is simply not enough of it the movie is just too long for it s minimal content too dialogue heavy and consequently almost impossible to watch what happens to put it all in a nutshell with room to spare three teenage girls irresponsibly and knowingly go out driving through an isolated area where over girls have previously been abducted and murdered their car of course breaks down and they are taken to an old boring house inhabited by three crazy people one of whom is the psychotic killer all three are eventually murdered one by one off screen after what seems like an eternity of boring slow paced nonsense as i said the only things worth watching even once are the murders please don t buy it or rent it just for that and don t be fooled like i was by the misleading box art and movie description save your money and your time
i would not consider myself as one of leonard cohen s greatest fans he does however feature as an important poet musician in my literary musical heritage by far the most valuable element in this documentary is to hear leonard s reflections on his own life and career warming and humble unfortunately the most of the musicians featured in the concert didn t converse the nuances of leonard s musical literary manner nick cave jarvis cocker beth orton were the exceptions even though leonard highly values rufus wainrights interpretations of his songs what particularly failed in this documentary was the ability of the filmmaker to allow the viewer to see who leonard cohen is and how these musicians connect to him a lot is said in this respect but the viewer is not drawn into the person leonard cohen this failing is especially evident with the interviews with bono and the edge they view leonard as a special icon but can t translate their exact value of leonard cohen the collaboration with u is a farce the entire live registration looks like a rushed job and just as in the whole film only leonard cohen remains his part and can tell about his own part the entire montage and screenplay is much like a high school extramural project the use of effects such as echo slow motion or flashed images are ill placed some of the camera work is dismal part of the score hardly recalls any associations i may have expected at times it seemed the filmmaker was adding psychotic elements to the film perhaps a reference to his once use of lsd some unintentional humor at some point leonard tells how he influenced a musical genre initially he can t recall the genre s name until eventually he says it was punk the punksters really picked up on his music the next scene in the film is a live cover of i can t forget and i can t forget i can t forget i can t forget but i don t remember who
bah another tired desultory reworking of an out of copyright work never designed to be filmed on the plus side toni collette is superb as always being an actual actress you see and there are some nicely handled handover cuts between scenes there are even a few genuinely funny lines and the filmwork score and editing is competent apart from a bizarre lapse into voiceover and speaking to the camera towards the conclusion but ah but much of the cast seems to be on autopilot and they are almost all very clearly too old and in one case too young for their declared ages worse they are all speaking austinese that peculiar falsetto self satisfied sing song that couldn t be further from the way people actually spoke in austen s day think yosemite sam i kid you not this is particularly sad considering that we seem to finally be seeing the demise of the equally farcial fakespearan that olivier and his cronies were so fond of bellowing at the top of their lungs and worst of all is gwyneth paltrow she s only ever played one character in her films and she stays true to form here running through her entire range smirking to sulking in the first ten minutes then just repeating herself for the rest of the overlong film there is absolutely no chemistry between herself and any of her admirers nor any apparent reason why they would be interested in her apart in short there is very little reason to watch emma it s an amiable enough adaptation but if you re going to pack a film full of anacronisms i e an appalingly thin lead who can t shoot a bow or handle a period accent then you might as well do it properly as with the vastly superior clueless
in film i feel as though it should be more than just art i think it should be more than that a way to tell a story on screen this short from david lynch tells a story but not much of one i felt that it was funny but too bizarre to be a comedy it is good film making but there really isn t anything else to it as i ve said before i am a huge david lynch fan but i get frustrated by some of his work because i don t see a need for it at all this is definitely my least favorite thing he has done so far but i know he s still got a ton of talent and i am excited to see what he has in store for us in the future if you like lynch check this out but don t be surprised when you don t like it very much
this movie has a very hard to swallow premise even by this genre s standards we are asked to accept not only that a record played backwards can bring a dead man back to life but that the record also contains hidden messages aimed specifically at one kid when the singer had no connection to the boy when he was alive and of course no way of knowing at whose hands the record would end up anyway the film is fun for a while but eventually the silliness and the pointlessness reign supreme if they were really trying to create a new freddy like horror icon they were way off the villain here has no personality no motivation and no variety
i love horror films low budget s s s s but how can anyone think this is a very good horror film let s compare it to titles in a similar vein haunted house films the haunting the changeling the shining or for a similar technology based horror film that was faaar better though still far from great demon seed ok i ll be fair let s compare it to made for tv horror films don t go to sleep waaay creepier and better done salem s lot the night stalker night gallery even don t go in the basement or crowhaven farm were far better spoilers first of all for as good a scene as the bloody shower scene was you have a scene like the opening scene oh boy the garden hose comes alive to hose down some frisky teenagers terrible also just what we understand about the house it apparently needs to use its video cameras to see what is going on and it s a very emotional house not a spirit or demon or entity it s a house thats possessed but by what we are led to believe an inanimate object learned to love suzie margaret our protagonist now that i m on the topic of suzie another scene that totally bothered me this poor old crazy lady comes tells you she was your nurse pours her heart out falls in the boiling pool struggling in agony for seconds and what does margaret do does she risk her hands being burnt to save this poor elderly woman that came there to warn her s life no she stands there and watches the acting for the most part was better than average for a horror film but that s where the positives end for at least a more interesting and fun horror film about an inanimate object that kills people watch death bed the bed that eats i have a feeling the people who rated this so highly either haven t watched it since it originally aired or remembered it scaring them as children this film was pretty much merit less
no this is nothing about that fairy tale with the pumpkin coach fairy godmother and the glass slippers but if i were to elaborate i would have to spoil it for you which i won t but don t let curiosity get the better of you as this movie is not fantastic it s one of those movies that start off promisingly before betraying its audience with cheap scare tactics and an incoherent storyline and that s real horror yoon hee to ji won and hyun soo shin se kyeong are your ideal mother and daughter one s a successful plastic surgeon while the other your dutiful obedient and beautiful teenage daughter their relationship is like hand in glove so close you d think of them more as siblings rather than parent child but things start to go wrong don t they always when hyun soo s friends whom yoon hee has operated on start to go berserk perhaps it s a warning to audiences and for those koreans ladies who don t bat an eyelid when going under the knife if news reports are to be believed the only truly scary moments are those scenes in plastic surgery though somehow i thought kim ki duk s time actually had more gore when featuring and describing what goes on during the surgery itself it s a tale of two halves the fist being an attempt to shock audiences with standard scare tactics which i admit did get to me now and then however the second half degenerated the movie into mindless mumbo jumbo melodramatics and was quite contrived into its forcing its ideas down your throat some things begin not to make sense and while attempts are always presented to explain you probably won t buy it not that horror movies are logical to begin with the leads are all beautiful and there is a distinct lack of male presence besides the negligible cop role but hey i m not complaining though the storyline could have been improved tremendously i d recommend you to watch this only if you re a fan of mediocre korean horror on vcd watch out for those face off ish moments
anyone who has read my review for uwe boll s alone in the dark will remember that i compared the unenviable task of sitting through that piece of human waste to having each and every hair on your arm pulled out well take that analogy a step further with this irredeemable gutter trash and try to imagine the pain of getting your teeth extracted without novacaine do that and you ll have a general idea of what eli roth s cabin fever is all about i never believed any one film was capable of topping the sheer agonizing dreck that uwe boll cranks out as the worst film ever made but in all honesty i have to say cabin fever comes very close this is yet another sad excuse for a motion picture that had absolutely no valid reason to meet with any form of theatrical release for somebody who claims to love the horror genre as much as eli roth does he has created the single most annoying and convoluted patchwork of a movie i think i have ever seen in my entire life how do you screw up a story like this think of the potential this plot would have had without the poorly written characters without the bad writing and without all that unnecessary and unfunny comedy a movie dealing with a grotesque flesh eating virus could and should have been so much better than what roth dished out for us here this script failed on so many levels with me and while i do not doubt the evident talent this director possesses i do know that he fumbled the ball big time on an idea that could very well have redefined the horror genre to say this was a production of missed opportunities would indeed be a gross play on words a generous amount of blood and unsettling special effects can t even save it and that is one element i normally go for there really was nothing about cabin fever that i could easily recommend to anybody when three quarters of the crowd walks out of the theater halfway through you know the movie is sinking fast my best advice to those reading this would be to simply rent before purchasing one viewing was more than enough for me to know that i will most likely never bother with it again
there is an interesting discussion in this movie is being a moral person good enough or do you need something more the movie preaches that without the guidance of god being a morally good person is not enough there is a line early in the movie you and i can look at a person who is morally good but both know he is going to go to hell while i am not a christian the discussions about this throughout the course of the movie were fascinating but not in the way the movie intended i left the movie with a stronger feeling that being morally good is enough the arguments and discussions presented were heavily biased so much so that they crush themselves in the weight of their own ignorance fanaticism can be a powerful thing especially when inferenced in the minds of the ignorant and uneducated as george carlin s character in dogma said hook em while they re young the basic premise is a very interesting one also a bible scholar from the s is attempting to publish a book that says that morality without god is ok as long as the morality is meaningful do you only tell a child not to steal or do you tell him not to steal because god tells you not to not bothering bringing up that telling the child not to steal because well how would he feel if it was his marbles that were stolen the author carlisle wants the recommendation of his school to help sell the book to spread the world however it needs unanimous consent and one of the scholars opposes it he brings up in a very interesting discussion early in the film about the morality for morality s sake vs god s words argument to prove his point he produces a time machine put in the movie solely to make the plot work which i m fine with and sends carlisle to the year to see where teaching morality without god will lead us as should be obvious he has his opinion and is changed by what he sees and has reversed himself by the time of his return for he does return that s not really a spoiler this is a bible movie after all as for the movie as a movie itself it s pretty slow and pretty poorly acted something that was not needed in this movie is that it produces two bad guys who want to try to figure out who carlisle is even tho he hasn t hurt anyone committed a crime or anything what s wrong with the movie just showing carlisle s opinion showing his view of this sinful world and returning him with a new viewpoint also there a few points in the movie which affirm to me that i m happy i m not a christian or at least someone who says it s god or nothing three near the end of the movie rather disturbed me first when the two bad guys corner carlisle right before he jumps carlisle does his only truly despicable act he fakes like his time jump is the coming of jesus and makes it so the bad guys who are also christians btw oddly enough think they just missed the rapture secondly after carlisle returns he finds a boy in which he scolded at the beginning of the movie about not stealing but not mentioning god kid kept the marbles and ran away and tells him this time that stealing is wrong because god commands it like the carlin quote above scaring kids into religion is a faux pas in my book and lastly the epilogue another scare tactic carlisle asks the inventor how far into the future they could go and he says he doesn t know the epilogue shows him trying to warp a bible into the distant future starts at and it fails he keeps decrementing the years by and trying again and by the fade out he s at like or so throughout the movie carlise mentions that he felt the end of the world coming because the world was rife with sin and the loss of the name of god scare tactics have been in use for thousands of years you would think in these enlightened times the church would have enlightened as well i m glad i saw this movie while i was fairly certain before that being morally good was enough now i know it for a fact worth watching if you are not a christian to affirm how happy you are to not be as ignorant as the folks in this movie
well this is a typical straight to the toilet slasher film long story short a bunch of teenagers young adults becoming stranded in the middle of creepy woods and get hacked down by naked nymphomaniac demons this movie has all the basics for this slasher fromage naked women teens or young adults being marooned in someplace spooky gory death scenes the last survivor being a well built young woman who will always show off her midriff but never bra less a creepy crazy man who knows about the evil lesbian kiss scene sex being a killer no ploteven then for a cheesy slasher film it was really terrible the atmosphere is totally dead nothing not even the sexually explicit scenes and nudity was enough to keep the male and lesbian female audience interested watching it felt like it was being watched with a nasty head congestion or a nasty head cold give the demonic
ok i will admit it started out very pleasing and good but then it just dropped downhill i cannot believe sarah michelle gellar could have even finished reading the script after about minutes into the movie the only reason i actually sat through the whole movie was i wanted to see the twist at the ned and to my surprise well folks i cannot even tell you if there ven was one because the end just leaves you confused and then the credit role i was like what the hell this did not deserve a theater run i am sorry but it didn t i mean it was horrible the only reaso i gave it a is because it had a few jumpy parts thats it you can watch it im not telling you not to hey you might even like it or even love it but if you hate it don t say i didn t warn you
i love movies i love independent efforts and major studio productions i love films with stars and i love those featuring unknowns i love dramas comedies action adventures science fiction mysteries westerns any genre except horror i love foreign films as well as those in english i love good movies and i even love bad ones because almost no film ever fails to entertain or amuse on some level except for even cowgirls get the blues when i attended a late night showing of cowgirls i joined an audience of around less than halfway into it i alone remained soon not even i could tolerate the disturbing mess unfolding before my eyes and i left as well to this day cowgirls remains the only movie i have ever walked out of i don t quite know how to describe this incoherent vacuous trashy meaningless film or how to adequately convey its lack of redeeming value suffice to say that it ranks as one of the worst major films of all time preposterous and inexcusable on every level it tries to be clever but its conception of feminism seems hopelessly anachronistic it tries to be funny but its humor is coarse and cringe worthy this is one of the few films which manages to profane its own ethos by depicting protagonists in so off putting a manner that you revolt against them and their values if you want to watch a movie watch waterworld ishtar anything but this except for the new alexander if you re choosing between that and this read a book instead
elizabeth taylor never could act at all and she was just her usual annoying untalented self in this film this was before she got so fat but she still looked very short and dumpy rock hudson was ok as bick benedict but clearly an actor with more range like william holden would have been better james dean certainly proved he knew how to mumble his way through a movie the whole film is incredibly slow and goes on for far too long the actors were all too young and lightweight and none of them aged convincingly due to the poor make up hudson looked ridiculous just being padded out and dean and carroll baker were obviously the same age
there aren t enough gay themed movies and there aren t enough coming out movies every one is a welcome addition to the genre although the production values are high the movie looks good matthias freihof philipp looks real good in a pair of jeans this is a bad one it is a period piece gay life under an oppressive regime east berlin a life that seems years behind the west in a way we re seeing our own history what it might have been like for gays in the s and s here it often reminded me of last exit to brooklyn the book not the film but it is unremittingly depressing and slow in a contrived way that evoked an old sctv send up of ingmar bergman it is so sloppily edited i wonder if the director just didn t hack at random yes it is a miracle that this was filmed and released before the wall came down and yes life behind the curtain was hard for gay people a good director could have shown all that without stupefying the audience a good director would have had me mark this one as one of the great coming out movies and not one of the misses
kalifornia is disturbing i believe there is no reason for this story to be told it is neither entertaining nor does it have social value technically the movie is very well make the performances are top rate and first class the story develops in an intriguing way that holds interest but at the end this movie sickens and is abhorrent to decency i recommend kalifornia to no one
the only good thing about this movie was the shot of goldie hawn standing in her little french cut bikini panties and struggling to keep a dozen other depraved women from removing her skimpy little cotton top while she giggled and cooed ooooof her loins rival those of nina hartley this movie came out when i was fourteen and that shot nearly killed me i d forgotten about it all tucked away in the naughty roladex of my mind until seeing it the other day on tv where they actually blurred her midsection in that scene good grief reminding me what a smokin hottie of a woman goldie hawn was in the s kurt russell must have had a fun life
to die for was just another d t v feature that made an appearance on cable ad nasuem during the early nineties the only thing notable about this feature was the last movie duane jones appeared in other than that there s no reason to watch this vampire flick unless you like pseudo chick flicks masquerading as a horror film a tired vampire longs for love and searches the back streets of l a looking for it will he succeed or will vlad just strike out again like he has for the last century this movie must have been big because a couple of sequels soon followed they re so bad they make this one look like a classic i know this is a movie about vampires but the film makers could have used to lighting not recommended by me because i didn t like it nuff said
when the film began i was shocked to see it was filmed using a cheap video camera in fact the camera shakes and looks worse than the average home movie even direct to dvd films should have production values better than this heck a large percentage of the home videos uploaded to youtube have better production values all too often the film seriously appears to be made by sticking the camera on a tripod and turning it on with no camera person closeups and anything resembling camera work are absent in some scenes where they might have worked and in others there are too many or poorly framed closeups yecch the film is about two gay men who want to become married as if was made almost a decade ago their only option was marrying in vermont times have definitely changed however the recent acceptance of gay marriage cannot in any way be attributed to this film if anything it set the gay marriage supporters back instead of helping as the movie stinks and never really tries to seriously address the issue according to the film religious people are one dimensional idiots who carry bibles everywhere and shoot people as well as wives who have gay husbands are narrow minded when they learn their spouses have been living a lie go figure i m sure glad it gives an honest chance to both sides on the issue the bottom line nothing about the film shows any professionalism at all and i even hesitate to call this a film it s more like a home movie and doesn t even merit a listing on imdb or even inclusion on imdb s bottom list of the worst rated films of all time the acting is horrible the writing is horrible the direction if there even is any is horrible the camera work is horrible and the plot is horrible it s a home movie there is nothing positive i can say about this in any way except that it makes the films of ed wood seem like oscar contenders in comparison and i am sure the ghost of mr wood is smiling every time someone watches this mess i don t care if you are gay or straight this film is not worth your time and i don t know how they managed to create dvds of it i assume one of the actors burns them on his home computer during his free time seriously this gives new meaning to the word bad by the way if the one lady in the film was a real lawyer wouldn t the ability to read be an important prerequisite i m just sayin finally with gay marriage being such a serious and important topic can t we have a film that s better than this that addresses the issue this one sadly only invites laughter
this is the second movie i saw for horrorfest this past weekend the gravedancers being the first gravedancers was better i can only guess from watching this that the production must have been quite limited i will admit the story started out interesting but really fizzled for me in the end we weren t really given time to sympathize or understand any of the characters which only made each of their erratic characteristics even more annoying i have to mention that there was also a bit of mis casting with a year old boy acting as sheriff the only reason i sat through the whole film was to find out what the big secret was which turned out to not be all that interesting some more background about the family would have helped but they didn t really seem like a family at all to begin with to me this film is so amateur that i couldn t even see putting it on dvd the four rating is for the initial potential the story might have had this was one to skip for horrorfest
this sports a nice deep cast but for a thriller you better deliver more than name actors and talk the first third of this movie was nothing but talk and more talk most of that was a bunch of women bitching about everything to each other the first five listed actors in here are women so that verifies that it s really a chick flick and little else this probably plays on the lifetime network there was a quick murder scene and then more talk by halfway through they had lost me by the way sally field looked about years old in here
first off i really loved henry fool which puts me in a very small pool of movie goers parker posey is one of best actresses on screen today but this film was a full out travesty watching hartley and the actors talk about the film in the extras so full of pride and making pointless analogies to star wars was stomach turning this was hype on the producers part hdnet realized to the max a true example of the emperor and his new clothes mostly i feel that hal has spoiled henry fool forever i don t think i can ever see it again in it s pure innocent light remember hal you can fool some of the people some of the time etc the director would be nowhere today if all he did was churn out meaningless garbage sadly it s a pure example of the lesson taught in the film adaptation the story must be exciting and active or its box office hopes are dim indeed never mind a decent story for the actors it was like trying to act in a straitjacket the score i believe hartley s is tasteless with drum hits walking all over dialog there was one apple soundtrack loop i recognized that gave me a smile when i saw the trailer i thought oh they re just trying to grab a new audience but it s really this ridiculous ride i d be happy to spoil this movie for you but it s been done it s rotten the fool franchise is dead long live henry fool
i went to the movies to see beat street it wasn t bad it was kinda neat krush groove was a flick that i didn t mind but when it came to rappin i drew the line word to your mother want me to stop that s just a small sample of the stupa fly style of rhymin on display in this waste of film and location permits this movie is seriously wack thats s speak for just f cking awful as an emcee mario van peebles is one hell of an actor and as an actor mario van peebles is one hell of a bodybuilder any film calling itself rappin had better deliver at that genre s highest standard of the time so why were year olds rolling in the aisles even back in the day when standards were so knee high to webster low because this rap is weak so weak that not even b e t or comedy central will touch it with a foot gold rope chain blondie s rapture is def poetry next to this bit of dr suess in the hood so don t be a boobie avoid this movie
i guess i only have myself to blame for the gigantic disillusion that is entrails of a virgin you already know not to expect a cinematic masterpiece when you see a juicy and proudly promoted title like this and the first impression only gets extra confirmed when noticing the film is a mid s production from japan now there are quite a lot of demented and sick filmmakers active in japan but kazuo komizu surpasses them all with his thoroughly depraved and sickening trilogy revolving on nothing but aggressive sex and the sadistic abuse of young girls not even attempting to tell a story entrails of a virgin simply presents a hodgepodge of un arousing semi pornographic sex and truly poor gore effects that wouldn t even please the most undemanding fan of cheesy s horror images of a bunch of photographers and their fashion models are inexplicably intercut with scenes of a filthy pervert having crude sex with a seemly under aged girl he dumps her not even a minute after climaxing typical and she begs him to stay even if she has to share him with other women i don t get it is this supposed to represent a general male fantasy because it s really clich d and wrongful anyways back to the bunch of horny photographers and docile models surprised by upcoming fog on their way home the group entrenches themselves in an abandoned country house where they have more appalling sex and eventually fall victim to a ridiculous sex demon who kills them all the acting performances are amateurish the dialogs inane and primitive and komizu s direction is weak and uninspired i can tolerate all that including the woman unfriendly portrayal of sex but i came too close to turning the film off during the indescribably mean spirited wrestling sequence one of the males brutally hits kicks and throws around one of the girls and calls her a filthy whore until she literally pees her panties and cries with agony this sequence is in my humble opinion the absolute low point of asian exploitation cinema one to avoid and maybe even boycott
what was an exciting and fairly original series by fox has degraded down to meandering tripe during the first season dark angel was on my weekly must see list and not just because of jessica alba unfortunately the powers that be over at fox decided that they needed to fine tune the plotline within episodes of the season opener they had totally lost me as a viewer not even to see jessica alba i found the new characters that were added in the second season to be too ridiculous and amateurish the new plotlines were stretching the continuity and credibility of the show too thin on one of the second season episodes they even had max sleeping and dreaming where the first season stated she biologically couldn t sleep the moral of the story the one that hollywood never gets if it works don t screw with it azjazz
just below the surface lies what a simply awful movie is what as other viewers have justifiably commented the storm sequences are just plain ridiculous chopping already sodden firewood in the pouring rain now that s smart menace foreboding sexual tension for those read dull contrived dull contrived and dull overly contrived i want to say thank god for mia sara s shower scene but in retrospect i think the producers of the film having seen the completed mess realised that they had to put something in to make it half way worthwhile at all so it just becomes yet another contrivance do yourself a favour and give this a miss
saw it at the philadelphia gay and lesbian film fest what can i say against my better judgment i liked it but it seemed to me that that acting was a little weak mostly i noticed this from the family of the teen boy i mean the script wasn t stellar to begin with but the actors didn t make me believe the relationships the plot is also predictable nonethelss i liked it the characters are likable and the plot is not challenging or upsetting it s sweet the characters care about each other and i don t count it as fifty minutes ill spent but i don t recommend it
i ve always thought that most huge box office flops usually have something to recommend them but after the remake of around the world in days and thunderbirds i m beginning to doubt it for those not familiar it s based on a puppet show about a family of astronauts who use state of the art rockets spaceships and subs to rescue people from various disasters falling bridges stricken planes burning buildings etc each week well the puppets are gone replaced by far more lifeless teenagers and so is the premise only one ineptly staged rescue and a plot shamelessly ripped off from spy kids without any signs of imagination wit or entertainment young alan tracey feels left out of all the rescuing we never see the other traceys do because dad won t let him play with a real rocket until he passes his exams grounded on a beautiful tropical island some punishment his chance to shine comes when the rest of the family a bunch of identikit bleach blondes who look like a gay neo nazi boy band without a single bit of characterisation between them are stranded in space and he has to have the day by er running around the jungle making a phone call firing a hose at the inept comedy relief villains and dousing them in gunk for bad measure the good points are few and far between one of them is that the film is mostly in focus the other is they all got to go to the seychelles which looks nice the bad points where to start ben kingsley s career lowpoint performance the aforementioned inept comedy relief sidekicks who would disgrace the children s film foundation at its worst the almost complete lack of action or effects in a m sci fi film the terrible script the lifeless direction the odious moralising but most of all is the fact that the film is so patronising in every possible way forget the life lessons and off the peg sentiment this is a movie aimed straight at the under eights by people who know they re making a kid s movie and are constantly talking down to their intended audience throwing in fifth rate jokes and routines that would insult most children who had only recently mastered the art of speech this film could replace being sent to bed early without their dinner as parents favourite punishment for kids the biggest flop in british film history it didn t even cover the cost of prints and marketing it s just about watchable if only as an object lesson in how not to make a summer movie
watching this stinker constitutes cruel and unusal punishment at the hands of sandler truly a slow and painful death bought the dvd in the bin at wal mart but the thought that keeps echoing in my head is how can i get my money back the most unforgivable thing about the movie is that the boat just does not sink best constructive suggestion mystery comedy theatre you know that show on the scifi channel in which some guy and his muppet machines spoof the most unwatchable horror flicks mystery science theatre immediately spin off a comedy program and feature this flick without a good humorous spoof of this train wreck i fear that viewers may actually begin following sandler with ice picks and chainsaws
less than minutes into this film i wanted it to end as it was painful all this horror movie was about was a group of whiny bitches doing stupid things for minutes arguing crying and screaming do not let the positive reviews fool you as this really is a terrible movie and you really shouldn t watch it the movies plot had potential to be something great but it just doesn t happen a group of five teenage girls are driving home one night when they find themselves being pursued by a crazed female driver who wants to kill them two minutes into the movie and the characters are already arguing and this doesn t stop all we have for minutes is a bunch of girls whining crying screaming acting and arguing none of the dialogue is even remotely interesting too so you don t get to really know these characters or enjoy them the acting was terrible and i was shocked to find out that these characters were meant to be teenagers none of these women looked a day under and one of them easily looked like she was nearly years old at least get people who look the age none of them gave even remotely decent performances and just seemed like they were picked off the street or were friends of the director with no acting abilities the actress who played the killer overdone it but she at least showed something that the other girls didn t a little bit of talent the characters don t help things because these girls are a bunch of whiny stupid bitches that is all i can really say about them and it did not help that they all survived if i have to go into detail in one scene the girls are being chased by the killer and having their car knocked a lot one girl injures herself and is whining about it four of them aren t wearing seat belts what do you expect one of your friends is being brutally attacked by the killer and you all just happen to be conveniently too hurt to help whatever the filming of the movie is absolutely terrible i don t care if this movie had a budget the size of a peanut the filming was terrible and it was like watching a pirated version of a movie the cameraman was clearly in the car with the girls pushed up against a window somewhere and the amount of times the camera blurred out shook and brushed up against an actress was horrendous it was also grainy and at times you couldn t hear what characters were saying not that it was anything worth listening to supposedly the killers car in the movie that supposedly got hit even though we only heard the accident is actually the directors car in real life no wonder they didn t show the car getting hit this movie is so cheap they can t even show a car getting a little scratched up oh gotta mention the soundtrack also if that s what it was it was horrid sad one second then hard rock the next at the end of the day five across the eyes just feels like a terrible home movie filmed in the middle of the road at night with a bunch of stupid girls screaming and arguing for minutes it doesn t help when the script is terrible the scares tension suspense and hardly even any gore to make up for it are absent the acting is terrible and the picture quality and filming are horrendous this was a horrible low budget movie avoid it at all costs
another too bad the lowest they can go here is one otherwise this would get an easy zero truly one of the worst films i have ever seen in fact were peckenpah s name not on the thing i would never have guessed he did it actually one of the people in san francisco i know was on the set a lot and from nearly sunup on he says that sam was just plain snockered it shows in spades the laughing bit at the early part of the film is the only thing in this entire mess worth a second look not even gig young is watchable this is a true test of masochism had i been forced into the confines of a theatre to see it i would have jumped up screaming and now i truly feel guilty having watched it all from the confines of a very comfortable couch that was just too nice to leave what a mess it seemed less written than made up as they went along it s not only a bomb but a bmob spelled backwards yikes
i m actually surprised at the amount of good ratings this anti christian pseudo documentary got now i respect the guy s opinion and faith i myself am not at this state believer of the taught christian doctrine however anti christian propaganda is somewhat of a different issue this film has valid points but they are very few and represented in a very biased context i m not recommending against seeing it in fact i think everyone should see it and decide on their own whether they believe it or not and this is actually more of a chance than the one the director gives to christian teachings rather than an inquiring approach on the subject it looks like a personal vendetta on the christian school that affected his childhood it also misrepresents the christians most of the times as either incredibly naive or fundamentalists no moderation in between the director uses movie scenes from passion of christ without permission sets up an interview with the headmaster of his former school and presents almost solely anti christian historians and writers i actually found the headmaster to be the most down to earth person and think that his attitude was fully justified i also strongly doubt that any of the christian believers who were interviewed were consulted afterwords or even told before the interview the purpose of the inquiry with this being said there are certainly new and interesting facts to be found here and some very original thoughts on the question of christianity but the way in which this whole think is produced is often offensive highly unprofessional and dreadfully biased
i watched free money last night it was the longest minutes of my life with such an intriguing cast i really thought that i was in for a treat especially since i m a brando fan wrong what a waste of talent it s almost embarrassing to watch at times like the cattle prod scene there were so many missed opportunities for humorous setups why didn t they show charlie sheen s character going back to tow brando s truck ugh it tries to be a slapstick comedy but i just wasn t buying into it skip this one only for die hard brando fans i m giving it out of because i still think the worse movie ever made was skidoo
this movie was the worst i ve ever seen it doesn t seem to have a plot but the time you realize this is far beyond the beginning of the movie so you have to watch the shut for a long time to recognize the total incompetence of the director aka the sloth that plays the tampon chick in the movie and we do not believe the willem dafoe in this movie he s a clone because the real dafoe like we know from apocalypse now and the boon dock saints would never agreed to such a script duh da foe wrote this bill shut together with his twenty years minus baby this movie starts with the credits of the two main characters dafoe and colagrande and then the two script writers dafoe and colagrande and then the director colagrande bottomline the story widow meets guy guy bangs widow widow smashes windscreen with guy who banged her title in netherlands the black widow different title same bullshit do not watch this movie it s a total waist of time
warning spoilers this is your typical disney film policticly correct what with the foster home that has an even divison of races insults the viewers intellect with its simplistic lines the boy s slezy father is almost directly taken from the never ending story in a world full of crime disase corruption starvation and other proplems that need to be taken care of only a losing team is worthy of divine intervention ughhhh did you know that angels don t like swearing where the heck did that come from in helping the team the angel cause pain and humilation on the opposing team very angelic indeed the team the angels are helping are called can you guess the angels disney at its worst just got his training wings brillent line my conculsion i did not like it at all
there are really two sections of this film firstly there s the laughable prologue to the film which is so hysterical and cornball that it would almost feel appropriate that the the simpsons troy mcclure should be doing the narration then the rest of the film begins starting off with a title song which really doesn t fit in with the rest of the film which while technically ok is killed by a vague inconsistent and unconvincing plot and not just uninteresting characters but characters that make no sense this is especially so with mickey rooney s spiventa who was supposedly in on the plot and part of the organisation the whole time yet what would have happened had hackman made the seemingly arbitrary decision to take him along when breaking out in that case he would ve been a totally superfluous and unnecessary character which in the end he still is the overall problem of the film is that it s totally unwilling to put any detail on who or what is behind this conspiracy it s as if the filmmakers didn t have the courage to imply that a particular section of society would be capable of creating such an organisation and instead settled on the hope that a lack of explanation would suffice and the audience would form their own conclusions put simply the film fails on all levels
horrible people ought to be the subtitle of this horrible film if you want to see ordinary people doing ordinary things then look out of your window at real life but if you want to see unpleasant people doing dull things you ll have to watch this horrible film by mike leigh the characters talk at length but never actually manage to communicate with each other why not presumably because leigh things that all of us are as ineffective and pathetic as his actors and he wants to film real life but we re not and he failed
what ever you do do not waste your time on this pointless movie a remake that did not need to be retold everyone coming out of the theater had the same comments worst movie i ever saw save your time and money nicgolas cage was biking down hills swimming in murky water and rolling down hills while being attacked by bees but yet his suit was still perfectly pressed and shirt crisp white until the very last scene although a good cast with ellen bernstein and cage the acting was just as unbelievable as the movie itself it is amazing how good actors can do such bad movies don t they get a copy of the script first if you still have any interest at all in seeing the movie at the very least wait for it to come out on dvd
i don t think i ve ever been so bowled over by the sheer absurdity of a movie in my entire life as i was when i walked out of this piece of crap nothing in it makes any sense none of it is clever or well thought out out of lack of truly suspenseful moments they repeatedly use that total cop out trick where you build up the music before the character does something like open a door or push aside a curtain and then nothing s there thats ok to do once maybe but i counted three times there are things thrown in for no apparent reason characters half formed story lines the characters weren t well developed at all the ending was bad bad bad bad everything every component of this film is terrible and i m just here to warn you all of that
i go to a lot of movies often i bring my year old son i am so glad i did not bring him to this one there are many references to sex and a skinny dipping scene however that is not the primary reason i would not take him to it the trailers lead you to believe it is a light hearted comedy nevertheless virtually all of the funny moments are in the previews i kept waiting for it to get interesting funny or anything but serious however i nearly fell asleep as the plot less story dragged on i understand that dogs can be great company that being said the entire story focused on a poorly behaving dog that the owners were not savvy enough to train if a human caused this much damage and mayhem that person would be banned the worst movie i ve ever seen with jenifer aniston or owen wilson a waste of their talent the best way to sum up this movie is couple gets unruly dog couple falls in love with dog dog dies couple sad the end
this is probably the first entry in the lance o leary nurse keat detective series in subsequent o leary films he was played by much younger actors than guy kibbee a group of relatives all played by well known character actors gathers in an old house on a rainy nite of course to speak to a wealthy relative who goes into a coma while they wait for him to recover all sorts of mysterious goings on happen including a couple of murders a creepy film worth seeing
much has been written about purple rain the apparent quin essential musician bio movie however i m here to tell you that the movie does not deserve it s high praise first of all let s get one thing straight prince is a great musician and music is the one area where purple rain excels even the score is mesmerising and if this was shot purely as a concert film it would be a great experience unfortunately it s not and as such the movie has some problems first of all is the horrendous acting writing prince s character the kid is supposed to come off as some type of mysterious loner of few words unfortunately this just comes off as corny and incensere a good loner character should at least have some talkative moments unfortunately prince s character rarely has over a few words of dialog in the film and it s hard to believe that he d get the girl this way everything just seems a little off here which is a shame because you can tell this is a character that s terribly conflicted and lives a very complicated live but we aren t ever allowed to get inside of it a surprising aspect of this film is just how much of this takes place in concert prince and morris s lives seemingly take a back seat to the performances here which i guess makes sense from a business perspective but it s exhausting to have a hour movie where seemingly half of it takes place on stage especially when the character s back stories get pushed aside for it so to sum it up this isn t a very good movie
i am appalled at how bad this film is as a pastiche of early th century hollywood artistes it sets a new low even past the moderns or gasp cradle will rock i never thought i d see a film worse than those granted they were about a slightly different milieu period nevertheless the intents results were distressingly similar first off there s the horrible casting eddie izzard as chaplin excuse me peter did you owe this guy something jennifer tilly as loulla parsons kirsten dunst as marion davies holy smoke these people don t even begin to try to capture the look or sound of the period they are purportedly depicting well last picture show was a decent film but this thing is a disaster the rest of bogdonovitch s pics haven t been much better guess rubbing up against welles hitch ford wore off a long time ago still good for hosting tcm though
quite one of the worst films i have ever seen terrible acting laughable action it s clear that the cars are travelling slowly atrocious script hideously unsatisfying ending and incompetent direction make a hash of a movie we know judge reinhold is a fine actor but he should be ashamed of this detritus there is no great tension within the car and when the characters stumble upon moments of hope they laugh like inane banshees for some reason even high five ing when they see the bridge lowered also the chain of events that lead these people to share the same car strains credibility apparently based on true events though if that s the case truth is evidently stranger than fiction unfortunate then that it was portrayed in such an inept manner
if you want to see a retarded homosexual karate expert beat up a bunch of try hard wannabe mexican gangsters repeatedly for an hr then this is the film for you if not then choose another dvd from the c bin which is the only place this film belongs the acting was so horrible that i had to force myself to watch it to the end the cover makes it look so cool but its just another cheap b grade gangster film along the lines of g s and a key bloody streetz and menace i would not buy or rent this film unless you are planing to get stoned and plot editing and acting really don t matter to you it is truly the worst film in the history of humanity
i ve seen enough of both little richard in interviews and in performances and enough of poor leon pigeonholed into these s s musical bio pics to know that leon was not the right actor for this role leon was so right as david ruffin in the temptations but fails utterly to capture the essence of little richard in this film actor miguel n ez who played little richard in why do fools fall in love was a much more suitable choice having pulled off the musician s powerful but effeminate persona if the performances are unconvincing then the film will be as well and this is what has happened here glossed over or missed entirely are lr s forays into homosexuality and voyeurism what the temptations did so well in capturing the rise of the group warts and all this film misses by a wide mark what is going on with director robert townsend who started off so well with the hollywood shuffle he s a talented funny guy but hasn t delivered anything near that first effort
simply put the movie is boring clich upon clich is confirmed and story lines never come together it seems as if the director was unsure whether to make a movie or a documentary the main plot is very thin a cia agent is ordered to kill an oil prince gets caught and then warns the prince why and therefore some elements were added to make the movie more interesting so a kid dies which results in the natural response of the father freely advising the person indirectly responsible for his son s death the lawyer has a drunk friend and keeps him around why no one knows some kids become suicide terrorists and blow up a ship all in all this is one of the worst movies i have seen in quite a while i was neither entertained nor intellectually challenged i neither laughed nor cried i did not gain an understanding nor was i compelled to learn more or take up a cause it meant nothing to me which in my eyes is the worst one can say about a movie
sometimes making something strange and contemporary doesn t always work to everyone s advantage while i will admit that the set design and concept of the film was rather interesting the execution of these ideas into one congruent story just didn t work this film was so hideously slow and pointless not even robin williams could save this garbage it s obvious barry levinson s dream fell flat on its face but he should have warned the rest of the world about this slop
i refused to watch this when it originally aired treasuring the memory of the late lamented s series with mike pratt and kenneth cope but i can never resist a challenge i should have known better not quite a remake and more of a parody than a homage this show didn t quite know how to play it and plumped with infantile comedy and cartoon plots and characters the three main characters were little more than caricatures of the actors and only emilia fox could act bob mortimer is painful in a straight role the supporting cast were merely comedian acquaintances of vic and bob s wanting to be part of the in joke and far too aware of the situation to be convincing and the cgi though the effects couldn t help be an improvement on those available years earlier merely dazzled the viewer with lights and camera work and did little to mask the poor quality of the scripts and dialogue all style and no substance and whereas the s show is mocked for being very much of its time this update is now also very dated with matrix style fashions obligatory girl power scenes and less than subtle tension between the two living leads
shallow grave begins with either a tribute or a rip off of the shower scene in psycho i m leaning toward rip off after that it gets worse and then surprisingly gets better almost to the point of being original bad acting and amateurish directing bog down a fairly interesting little story but the film already surpasses many in the yankee comes down south to get killed by a bunch of rednecks genre because it is actually shot in the south a group of college girls head to ft lauderdale for summer vacation and are waylaid in georgia by a flat tire after getting off the main road note to yankees stay on the highway when you go to florida sue ellen lisa stahl has to pee so she heads into the woods when she finally finds a good spot to do her business she witnesses the local sheriff tony march strangle his mistress merry rozelle to death note to yankees do not wander off into the woods when in the south not because you might witness a murder but you may run across a marijuana plantation this is the point where the story not the movie actually comes close to being good while tony march will never have to practice his oscar speech his sheriff dean becomes a creepy facsimile of a normal guy torn by what he has done and what he must do tom law is likable as deputy scott and is as authentic a southern deputy as i ve seen since walton goggins deputy steve naish in house of corpses a few scenes in the movie are worth the mention the girls stop at a bbq in south carolina and display their racism when a big black guy checks them out sue ellen runs into a barn to hide behind some hay bales and in a shockingly realistic moment a large snake is hiding in the hay with her and in the strangest scene sheriff dean makes like he s about to rape patty carol cadby and tells her to take off her clothes dean has turned the radio up to drown out the noise of what he s about to do the preacher on the radio needs to go back and read his bible his sermon is about how jezebel is saved by the blood of jesus christ i feel sorry for this preacher s flock jezebel was in the old testament a few thousand years before christ was born and by no means is she one of the five people you are going to meet in heaven
as a huge fan of horror films especially j horror and also gore i thought nekeddo bur ddo sounded pretty good i researched the plot read reviews and even looked at some photos to make sure it seemed like a good gory and scary movie to watch before downloading it so excited it had finished and ready to be scared and recoiling in horror at the amazing gore i was expecting i was terribly disappointed the plot was ridiculous and didn t even make sense and left too much unexplained the gore was hilarious rather then horrifying and what was with the cartoon style sound effects the acting was probably the only thing mildly scary about it i did not understand the cactus idea and the way the mothers husband disappeared in the middle of the sea after following a flashing light they left both pretty unexplained or perhaps i missed it as my mind couldn t understand what i was actually seeing i appreciate the way it was supposed to be shocking and a few scenes the strange cannibalism and own mother kissing certainly were i just think they went a little bit far and not even in a horrifying way they made it to unconvincing which made it more believable to be a comedy rather than a horror in my opinion however it is a very entertaining film and got a lot of laughs out of me and a couple of friends but sadly we were expecting horror not comedy so its worth a watch for the entertainment value but don t be expecting a dark deeply scary and horrifying film you ll just be disappointed if this was a horror comedy spoof i d probably rate it about a nine the climax being the weird scene when the husband climbed inside his wife s stomach and closed up her wounds but as a horror sadly i gave it a one
this is one of those movies that appears on cable at like two in the afternoon to entertain bored housewives while they iron the acting is second rate poor mathew modine seems to sleepwalk through the whole film and god help gina gershon her accent is too over the top it sounds nothing like an true english woman it sounds forced and phony much like her acting she should stick to what she does best lesbian showgirl con artist who plays in a rock roll band and has a drug problem the other characters are no better they are two dimensional empty vapid and silly how are we to supposed to care about these people at one point christy scott cashman get s lost in central park really it s not that hard to navigate central park just follow any path out not only did i not care about any of the characters i downright hated them the only reason i even stayed with this train wreck of a film was fisher stevens even his brilliant humor couldn t save this dying fish each scene is typical romantic comedy fare and nothing is left to surprise us the script was awful as was the acting if you catch this fish throw it back
i look around in the video store still in shock how steven seagal with his track record of bad action movies can still have movies hit the shelves in less than a year attack force being the rd no less promised the first time entrance into the sci fi genre for our ever widening seagal visions of bad movie entertainment flashed before my gullible eyes sadly this is not the case one bit with no entertainment and a movie as bad as they come seagal rebounded a tiny bit with the trashy but enjoyable shadow man last time we saw him however attack force has to be his absolute worst movie ever don t argue for out for a kill ticker or even black dawn folks this is the bottom of the septic tank here anyone who says this is steven seagal s return to form should be forced to write a page essay on the word taste seagal is yet another agent i m a supreme bad ass yet again named lawson wants revenge for the killing of his team that leads him to a nefarious plot to distribute a really bad drug to the unsuspecting public not to mention the dealers are not from around here the whole production from directing to the acting is poor was this movie shot in the dark its gotta be the most poorly lighted movie since howling the action is terrible and very badly done the producers have also unwisely decided to do what the fans hate the most throw in stunt double after stunt double and horribly dubbed steven seagal who seems to show little enthusiasm here can ya blame him while it has been said that attack force was not the movie stevie signed on for originally harvester and surely has to be better than attack force the post production tampering has not made it more coherent and made seagal look worse i feel bad for directer michael keusch and writer joe halpin as they are gonna be judged forever for the ill advised production re shoots so now this leaves seagal in the impossible position to come up with something to atone for this mess but after seeing how bad attack force has turned out do we really want him to make another movie
american film makers decided to make a film they think is japanese the characters all badly represented the actors are not even japanese and the set is cheap unreal and definitely doesn t represent kyoto in early ties and ties who ever read the book understand that the script writers didn t add any extra value to differentiate the movie from the script worse they even changed the original plot line with a few goofs rob marshall is using for his two main characters two well known chinese actors who joined before in crouching tiger hidden dragon marshall probably saw one chinese movie and tho they represent japanese culture seeing those two actors together again even makes the movies more ridiculous quentine tarantino s last scene in kill bill is ten times more japanese made than that of this movie
it is a great tragedy that both richard harris and john derek are no longer with us but that shouldn t blind anybody to the fact that in a pretty ugly blotch appears on both men s cvs no doubt john derek conceived this movie doing for his wife what some like it hot and one million years bc did for maryln monroe and raquel welsh respectively creating an iconic sex symbol for the new decade having run to embrace dudley moore on the beach in bo s reputation an all star cast and location filming in sri lanka meant that nothing could go wrong alas as they say mortals plan and god laughs it is said that when this film premiered in the edgar rice burrows estate tried to take legal action against it bo derek plays jane parker who sets off into turn of the century africa to be reunited with her boozy abusive dad richard harris daddy parker is an explorer who has set out to find the great inland sea the stuff of local legend whose existence has been poo pooed by conventional wisdom harris is worth watching for a wonderfully hammy tanked up performance which includes singing an irish ditty at an indian elephant that somehow found its way into africa did it arrive at the same time as the orang utan from sumatra furthermore although jane professes to despise parker bo and rich s relationship is creepily incestuous testimony perhaps to the effects of the tropical heat before long however local legends start to circulate about a great white ape and jane hears the famous yodel this is the movie s cue for miles o keefe a future b movie star making a rather odd debut as the loin clothed lord of the jungle unlike johnny weismuller with his pidgin english or ron ely who speaks the language fluently the o keefe tarzan is mute given some of bo and richie s dialog though this is probably not a bad thing harris and his caravan eventually reaches the great inland sea located atop a gigantic plateau that seems to run halfway across africa hang on aren t seas lakes and other watery places generally located in low lying areas nevermind it is just one of many anomalies in the john derek universe the crew attempt to mount the cliffs and when the ropes snap harris roars echoing abuse at the hapless men who have plummeted to their deaths on another occasion jane decides to take a nude swim by the inland sea giving another occasion to see some gratuitous nudity out of nowhere a single male lion appears now lions usually travel in prides and never go near beaches but later on tarzan will be wrestling with a venomous boa constrictor zoology doesn t seem to have been one of john derek s strong points this being a tarzan movie jane becomes enchanted with the lord of the jungle and resolves to take his virginity but having seen his closeness to some of those chimps you do have to wonder speaking of which it s not only the edgar rice burroughs estate could have sued it is highly probable that certain primates were on the phone to their lawyers the chimps here make you miss cheeta badly especially when they do ridiculous things like ride on the backs of elephants and clap their hands when tarzan and jane finally get it on the climax of this film has bo and harris captured by some rather stereotypical cannibals who paint our heroine and prepare to sacrifice eat execute her suffice is to say that the great wooden ape gets his girl and spoiler harris gets himself impaled on a huge elephant tusk this doesn t stop the dying parker from delivering a rambling monologue to jane as far as i am aware the law suit from the rice burrows estate never materialized but tarzan the ape man was crucified at the box office no kidding a pity john derek could have directed tarzan the ape man with bo derek and miles o keefe living in domestic bliss and dudley moore as boy
the nsa cia fbi fsb and all other snoop agency in the world should watch this movie to gain information as to how to spy on people as mst k commentary states it sanata has the dirt on every santa s tentacles reach far and wide there is no hiding from the klaus organization from telescopes that can spy over millions of miles to ears that can hear everything its amazing that the cia doesn t have santa on the payroll satan s dance routine is hilarious pitch he is so useless the cheese factor in of this movie is tremendous very low budget but so fun to watch i recommend watching the mystery science theatre version for even more laughs you even get a laugh at the missfortune of the good kids i give this a for production quality and a for pure cheese and fun factor
the film was made in and with world war around the movie industry decided to capitalize on the fact that spies were around the film is fun to watch due to the fabulous dancing of eleanor powell the late miss powell was certainly a great hoofer in every sense of the word she is again paired with a very young looking red skelton here the two of them also starred in i dood it moroni olsen who years later was superb as the interrogating police officer in mildred pierce again appears as an officer asking powell to deliver an item trouble is that olsen and his rogues are really the japanese spies bert lahr is his usual brilliant self here and he gets ample support from virginia o brien
after a quasi gothic all fruity music video the movie starts with cassidy the lead singer killing herself in a perfect world that would be that and the end credits would roll we don t live n that world the insipid band members decide to go to some clown to contact her dead essence when i say clown i mean actual clown he tell them they re all going to die via cassidy s ghost the spirit possesses dora one of the band mates we couldn t care less as the characters are all boring vapid and extremely horribly acted written by adam hackbarth an incredibly apropos surname if there ever was one and directed by corbin timbrook who after the attendant and tower of blood has to know that he keeps making crap for a living this movie s a constant battle between the film s incompetence and the viewer s need to stay awake not enough blood to appease gore hounds nor enough nudity to satisfy pervs this movie in fact has absolutely nothing to recommend to absolutely anyone my grade f eye candy amanda carraway gets topless where i saw it starz on demand
i have to say i am really surprised at the high ratings for this movie i found it to be absolutely idiotic the mother gets visions when she touches certain things or people and one thing she touched twice made her vision continue just seemed so ridiculous deedee pfieffer s performance was awful i thought she was very irritating the girl who played lori did a good job and so did most of the supporting cast for what they had to work with i usually love lmn and am very open minded when it comes to movies but this movie seemed to have a ridiculous plot and over the top acting and it just was not for me
there just isn t enough here there a few funny spots but not really enough i was very disappointed because i love stupid movies i was expecting this to be a hidden gem it was not it was a hidden turd the whole time i was watching it i was thinking geez i could do better than that and i m a moron don t believe the few good reviews i was suckered in by them at no point did i laugh at loud maybe this was funny or cutting edge in but man it fell flat today this movie had promise it just didn t deliver on it maybe if they rewrote it a few more times i cant fault the actors they weren t the best but they just didn t have much with which to work this movie failed because of threadbare writing sorely disappointed
remember a film you seemed to enjoy in the past that doesn t quite meet those same feelings as an adult that occurred to me when i went back to school the national lampoon s class reunion the film has a perfect opportunity for laughs but surprisingly wanders aimlessly as we see a bizarre collection of characters such a woman who sold her soul to the devil and can shoot out flames of fire from her mouth a man who appears to be a vampire and a lunatic killer dressed as a woman and wears sacks over his head you have the class president who believes he s the best thing since sliced bread but as we see in the film he s a coward and joke a couple of pot smokers who don t even know they are at their own class reunion and a man named gary for whom know one even knew existed and no one can seem to remember his name this is the one running joke i enjoyed there is a plump pervert who likes to grab women in inappropriate places a deaf and blind woman who has a screeching holler when calling for her dog and the cook you know her from goonies and throw mama from the train who loves to place food on people s plates with her hands the film is essentially about a nutcase who is or at least attempting to taking revenge on his classmates for a gag they pulled on him they arranged for him to sleep with his own twin sister the film follows the characters as they search for the killer canvasing darkened trashed hallways of the old high school they were told of the killer by his psychologist who seems a bit odd himself the film has a few good gags that work pretty much early on but the film slowly gets worse each passing minute the film s true problem is that it really doesn t know where to go the film is pretty much a one joke premise for it has unassured direction if it really has any direction at all the cast is enthusiastic enough but the material they are to make funny just doesn t have the quality to hold any interest it s a curio for fans of early s comedy relics that are forgotten this one rightfully so
if you like films that are totally bizarre then this one is for you abdullah is one mean mother with a passion for strangling people and eating ham you should check this film out just for a laugh it is a low budget sci fi musical comedy cannibalistic classic if you get bored of the film half way through you should persevere just for the sake of seeing the aliens which are nothing more than little toy robots but in my opinion are the films highlight i m the big meat eater pass me
pros nothingcons everythingplot summary a female reporter runs into a hitchhiker that tells her stories about the deaths of people that were killed by zombies review never in my life have i come across a movie as bad the zombie chronicles filmed on a budget of what looks to be about bucks tzc is a completely horrible horror movie that relies on lame forgetable actors whom couldn t act to save their lives and gore that s more gross than frightening how does a movie like this even get made simply put avoid tzc like a sexually transmitted disease my last cents humorously enough this movie was made by a movie company called brain damage films they re brains must have really been damaged to come up with a craptacular movie like this my rating out of if it were up to me this movie would get the rating of negative bajillion
billy crystal normally brings the crowd to laughter but in this movie he and all the rest of them cannot bring any smile on my face or perhaps just one they call it comedy i say it s a waste of my time
if you don t mind having your emotions toyed with then you won t mind this movie on the other hand if you enjoy british crime mysteries following clues and seeing how they all logically fall into place at the end you ll be very disappointed here are some of the logical inconsistencies that lead to that disappointment while the police utilize the cctv cameras early on to gather clues about the mystery the huge truck that stopped and blocked the children s view just before her disappearance doesn t get caught on camera this is a critical piece of the mystery it s inconsistent to have the car the children were in caught on camera and not the big truck that is so critical to the mystery the movie goes to great lengths to show the sophistication of the equipment in tracking down the children s movements but misses the opportunity to utilize the same sophisticated equipment is tracking down vehicles that may have entered the crime scene from camera visible locations adjacent to the crime scene as part of developing clues in england driving is on the left the director goes out of his way to have the car at the crime scene park on the right several meters away from the flower kiosk when it could have easily parked immediately behind or even on the side as the huge truck did the police forensics team is so meticulous as to find a discarded cell phone in a sewer drain several miles from the scene of the crime but can t find any blood evidence from the head injury right at the crime scene even though they secured the scene just hours after the disappearance and with no intervening rainfall search dogs were not used at all to find the missing children this from the country that is well known for developing the hound dog for search and hunting it is illogical that such a highly publicized news story would not turn up the presumably innocent truck driver that stopped at the flower kiosk it is illogical that the mother would go to such extremes and expend so much effort to leave carpet fiber clues under her fingernails for her eventual murder investigators even coaxing her daughter to do the same while she simply could not have crawled out of the unguarded mobile home if she had enough sense about her to ask her daughter to get carpet fibers under her nails she could of just as easily asked her daughter to call out for help or even leave the mobile home that was in a crowded residential park the suspect that abducted the little girl was portrayed as mentally slow dimwitted justifying his unknowingly drowning of the mother but he was smart enough not to cooperate with the police and also fully exercise his rights not to self incriminate there are more inconsistencies like this that will lead to a true sleuth aficionado s disappointment five days is a very weak british crime story
perhaps it s because i am so in love with the william holden kim novak version or because i m not a gen x er but this was absolutely the worst remake i have ever seen without the original s soundtrack it just seemed like another typical tv movie yes about as bland as kraft cheese
this is by far the worst movie i have ever seen i was going in expecting a cheesy movie but at least with some cool car scenes races what i got was nothing the racing scene are so low budget they sped them up to make it look like the cars are going fast in one scene a mercedes slr goes from over to in like seconds by just spinning around in circles its just ridiculous if you wanna see a real movie about cars see the fast and the furious series they may be a little cheesy but x better than this movie could ever hope to be better yet just watch mischief the best car movie ever made i think
woman with wig who dyes her hair in the middle of the film takes of wig presumably does not see what the audience can see from miles away begin spoiler alert that her hubby is having an affair with her best girlfriend and they both try get rid of her end of spoiler alert and what a spoiler that was the title already gives it away doesn t it bad acting bad script waste of time oh yeah in the end she lives happily ever after if you liked this movie you ll really love cannibal women in the avocado jungle of death
i d never seen a tarzan movie before so when i saw it on the tele i thought i d give it a shot unfortunately i have to say i was disappointed tarzan was over years old and somewhat overweight not how i d imagined tarzan would look and unless i missed it while making myself a cup of tea tarzan never gave his traditional warbling yell also missing was tarzan swinging through the trees leaping from vine to vine oh well so much for expectations anyway jane was there the monkey cheeta was there there was some guy with a guitar there there were villains and good guys and a romance all very harmless and predictable nothing bad you understand but equally nothing good probably not the best movie to introduce tarzan
from the nepotism capitol of the world comes another junk flick in a fancy wrapper cq tells a lame disjointed mess of a story which is little more than a bunch of silly caricatures a babe and straight man davies running around trying to make a stupid sci fi flick i can t think of any reason anyone would want to spend time with this ridiculous attempt at film making d
despite being a sequel to the more potent original this is more of a comical remake of friday the th concerning the further antics of psychopathic angela killing more nubile teens for their immorality at a camp pamela springsteen sister of bruce looks great there are some pretty darn funny sex scenes with some pretty darn attractive girls but the movie s so unintentionally comedic rather than suspenseful it s a stinker out of mpaa rated r for graphic violence and gore nudity and for some sexuality language and drug use
when ritchie first burst on to movie scene his films were hailed as funny witty well directed and original if one could compare the hype he had generated with his first two attempts and the almost universal loathing his last two outings have created one should consider has ritchie been found out is he really that talented does he really have any genuine original ideas or is he simply a pretentious and egotistical director who really wants to be fincher tarantino and leone all rolled into one colossal and disorganised heap after watching revolver one could be excused for thinking were did it all go wrong what happened to his great sense of humour where did he get all these mixed and convoluted ideas from revolver tries to be clever philosophical and succinct it tries to be an intelligent psychoanalysis it tries to be an intricate and complicated thriller ritchie does make a gargantuan effort to fulfil all these many objectives and invests great chunks of a script into existential musings and numerous plot twists however in the end all it serves is to construct a severely disjointed unstructured and ultimately unfriendly film to the audience its plagiarism is so sinful and blatant that although ritchie does at least attempt to give his own spin he should be punished for even trying to pass it off as his own work so what the audience gets ultimately is a terrible screenplay intertwined with many pretentious oneliners and clumsy setpieces revolver is ultimately an unoriginal and bland movie that has stolen countless themes from masterpieces like fight club usual suspects and pulp fiction it aims high but inevitably shots blanks aplenty revolver deserves to be lambasted it is a truly poor film masquerading as a wannabe masterpiece from a wannabe auteur however it falls flat on its farcical face and just fails at everything it wants to be and achieve
what a piece of stupid tripe i won t even waste time evaluating any of the points of this show it s not worth the time the one comment i will make is why get such a dumb inarticulate doofus to be the star there aren t many more dismal testimonials to the deteriorating mental condition of the networks than the fact that fox has stated it will not bring back john doe a decent series but will bring back brain dead drivel like joe millionaire for yet another round of killing the brain cells of the american public fox has lost it imho
in the autobiographical coming of age tale romulus my father eric bana of munich fame plays an impoverished german migr struggling to raise his son raymond kodi smit mcphee in rural s australia the major obstacle to the family s stability and happiness is his wife christina franka potente who flagrantly violates her wedding vows by shamelessly shacking up with other men despite her highly unconventional behavior romulus refuses to grant her a divorce masochistically torturing himself in the vain hope that she will one day return to him it is unfortunately the good hearted and good natured raimond who must bear witness to all this marital turmoil and it is his memoir that serves as the basis for the movie raimond gaita would later grow up to be an author even though i admire romulus my father for what it is trying to do i can t honestly say i enjoyed it for while the film has some fine performances and serious intentions going for it these simply aren t enough to counteract the dour storyline and funereal pacing which leave the audience as despairing and depressed as the people on screen a serious slice of life drama is one thing but this unremittingly downbeat wallow in adultery insanity and multiple suicides let alone attempted suicides is something else again
in an apparent attempt to avoid remaking the original movie an excellent cast that should have made this inherently funny classic neil simon material better than the original failed on every level the chemistry between goldie hawn and steve martin that was magic in housesitter was nonexistent in this effort
there have been some funny movies about spirits to come out of hollywood cary grant was an angel in the bishop s wife of course the best were the topper movies in the late s early s and more recently warren beatty s heaven can wait which was a remake of s here comes mr jordan these were well written funny entertaining comedies all of which centered around supernatural creatures like ghosts and angels now comes writer director jeff lowell making his feature film debut with a story of an unlikable bitchy young woman kate eva longoria parker who gets killed on her wedding day and then comes back to harass the fledgling spiritualist ashley lake bell who is falling for kate s fianc henry paul rudd one thing that is clear at the outset longoria parker is no constance bennett marion kerby in the first two topper films who is the standard against whom all female ghosts are measured there is a line right at the beginning when henry s sister chloe lindsay sloane tells henry you don t smile that aptly described my situation throughout this film the main problem with the film is that the script just isn t very funny but it s made worse by longoria parker s presence that just rubbed me the wrong way every time she appeared on the screen just to start out with compounding her lack of comedic talent she is covered with so much pancake makeup who knows what she really looks like kate gets killed while setting up for her wedding by a falling frozen statue she s so unreasonable that the angel who instructs her about what her afterlife is about walks out on her well she actually just fades out so kate finds herself back on earth as a ghost without knowing what her mission is chloe wants henry to snap out of the funk into which he has naturally descended after kate s death from what i saw of kate he should have felt a wonderful relief so she introduces him to ashley who really doesn t know what she s doing as a spiritualist she is also a cateress to make ends meet to see if she can get henry back in touch with kate there s a lot of meshugaas that goes on the vacuity of the film is epitomized by a b story revolving around ashley s assistant dan jason biggs this is thrown in near the end but the way ashley handles it indicates that she s as much of a boob as kate since dan is apparently attracted to both of these severely flawed women he deserves whatever he gets eventually kate appears to ashley and the fun should begin it doesn t and more s the pity because in other hands this could have been pretty funny as it is norman z mcleod constance bennett roland young alan mowbray and co must be turning over in their graves to see this is what their brilliance in the first two topper films has wrought
unbelievably bad acting a no good unclear story and flashy images and slow motions where they are needed the least adrenaline is everything a movie should not be georgina verbaan a so and so dutch soap actress who hasn t attended her english classes plays rich girl freya who has the habit of thrill seeking which basicly is doing dangerous stunts break stuff and annoy people and not in a fun jackass way then there s dracko rivas he kinda leads the bunch but has other illegal activities on the side then there s freya s dad lockyer who plays a dubious role as well and in the end we got jason debutant fyall the boyfriend of freya one day freya gets disappeared and everybody seems involved but we the viewer really don t care as nobody of the cast is either likable or believable and the story doesn t make any sense why was this even made
i doubt this will ever even be a cult film i loved gram parsons to be sure and i did not expect much out of this film and got even less what could have been clever and moving was campy it was devoid of the music that made gram and had more filler than cheap dog food there was no background on gram or the colorful people of that era the characters shown were not familiar to me even as a fan of gram s and all the versions of his afterlife adventures i have heard rock and roll is full of tales good ones too but they should taken with a grain of salt they can be great stories even though exaggerated however this movie took a good story and turned into tripe stealing any dead body and the ensuing implications should never be a dull tale but they made it dull somehow i am tempted to steal every copy of grand theft parsons head out to the desert and burn them all
this is a really dumb movie it could be fun with the cool looking aliens and the country setting but it just isn t some aliens hear the broadcast of war of the worlds when a small country radio station plays it on halloween they come to earth to kill humans but instead of killing they make people their slaves and act goofy the front cover of the film shows these aliens riding surfboards in space not really what they do these aren t party aliens they are stupid cartoonish idiots with annoying high pitched modulated voices the alien with the most tolerable voice also happens to be the jack nicholson rip off alien who always wears his sunglasses other than the aliens the acting is terrible the writing is obviously meant for children because every character is written like a kid this is a dumb movie that only children will appreciate maybe my rating out of mins pg for mild language
poorly written conspiracy drama mystery about the possibility that aids was introduced to the public by the government wlaschiha plays a gay researcher looking for answers that within this foggy plot would be hard for anyone to find despite the cinematography itself being commendable the camera hungers for characters of true depth instead of the shallow amateur acting it unfortunately has to convey grade d
no i haven t read the stephen king novel thinner but i choked down the film version horror movies are an acquired taste regular movies give an audience a hero to applaud as he strives to achieve a goal in horror movies audiences are invited to savor the demise of characters in director tom holland s low fat but tasteless revenge chiller thinner nobody wins and everybody deserves the bite that is put on them gluttonous new england attorney billy halleck robert john burke of robocop has a weight problem although he rocks the bathroom scales at pounds he appears happily married to a trim delectable wife heidi lucinda jenney of g i jane with a yeasty teenage daughter fat doesn t mean stupid here halleck displays his sagacity in court when he wins an acquittal verdict for sleazy mafia chieftain richie ginelli joe mantegna of house of games driving home from a victory feast billy hits an old gypsy woman crossing the street and kills her a cover up occurs and halleck s friends get him out of the soup the disgruntled gypsy father taduz lemke michael constantine of skidoo retaliates with a curse on the corpulent lawyer and the two town officials that exonerated him suddenly halleck finds himself shedding pounds no matter how much chow he chomps when he begs the vengeful gypsy to lift the curse the old man refuses desperately halleck resorts to richie while halleck struggles with the gypsies to remove the hex he learns that his loyal wife has turned his attentions to the town s hotshot doctor thinner qualifies as not only laughably inept horror flick but the filmmakers also rely on stereotypes of men and women tom holland who directed child s play and scenarist michael mcdowell have served up such a slipshod script that you cannot relish watching billy get his just dessert and shrivel up thinner boasts few shocks and fewer surprises the filmmakers may have regurgitated king s novel but they have filleted whatever sense of horror and humor it contained holland and mcdowell introduce characters such as the mafioso then inexplicably let them off the hook one minor character shows up long enough to die and have a chicken s head stuffed in his mouth the stereotypical behavior of the characters may offend audiences too thinner depicts women as oversexed vixens and men as swine when halleck sneaks home from a clinic he finds his doctor s sports car parked at his house his suspicions ripen into jealousy and he cooks up a scheme to get the curse transferred to this wife even the premature ending lacks any satirical flavor oscar winning special effects wizard greg cannom of van helsing and make up artist bob laden do a fabulous job beefing up actor robert john burke to look obese they succeed too in making him shrivel only die hard stephen king fans will be able to stomach this misogynistic gooledyspook
i have yet to read a negative professional review of this movie i guess i must have missed something the beginning is intriguing the three main characters meet late at night in an otherwise empty bar and entertain each other with invented stories that s the best part after the three go their separate ways the film splits into three threads that s when boredom sets in certainly the thread with the felliniesque babushkas who make dolls out of chewed bread is at first an eye opening curiosity unfortunately the director beat this one to death even injecting a wild plot line that leads nowhere in particular bottom line a two hour plot thin listlessness if you suffer from insomnia view it in bed and you will have a good night sleep
i began watching this movie with my girl friend and after minutes i was alone i succeed to stay until the end it has been a painful experience i liked jean hugues anglade but i think that he needed to eat as us and thus he accepted to play in this movie there are only characters and the rest could be called art or something that i couldn t express but that i didn t understand at all the only worst movie i saw was crash but i m pretty sure now that i have enough experience to watch it successfully again good luck o
in the future of a governmental committee headed by howard hesseman is holding hearings on tv s first uncensored network they sample it s programming that play as a series of skits i can name the good skit movies on one hand not using my thumb amazon women on the moon kentucky fried movie the meaning of life and mr mike s mondo video notice how i didn t mention tunnel vision the reason for that is that this movie is death in cinematic form none of the skits are even remotely funny or even the least bit clever it takes some sort of great ineptitude on the film makers part to not even get one laugh out of me my grade f eye candy dody dorn goes full frontal
bo derek s debut film remained unseen for eight years and that s how it should stayed john derek was a competent actor but as a director he s virtually the ed wood of erotic cinema not that this is especially explicit considering that bo atypically sporting dark hair was only when the film was made john also wrote and photographed it the latter results in some decent footage of the greek island setting against which the narrative is set but the plotting is puerile and the dialogue atrocious the character played by male lead peter hooten has been brought up with bo s family they grew up as brother and sister but now in their teens the couple discover they re attracted to one another but as i said don t expect any sexual fireworks still the worst thing about this is the fact that the protagonists each harbor an obsession all through the film which are not only silly in themselves but irritating in their relentlessness hooten wants to turn the remote fishing community into a modernized sea side resort and keeps expecting a cruise liner to appear into view which of course it does at the finale derek s is even nuttier she craves possession of a large antique bath tub for the record the couple are married by the end of the film also involved in the non events are the female town mayor and a photographer lothario who wants to make a model out of bo and who naturally incurs the wrath of the jealous hooten occasionally for no very good reason we re even treated to snippets from the screening of old hollywood classics in an open air movie house to which the whole town assembles among the titles shown is the public enemy at the end of the day while bo s naivete throughout is undeniably charming it s not enough to offset the film s overwhelming dullness and amateurishness
working at a video store i get to see quite a few movies and on occasion i try to watch some of the not so big movies proud happened to be one of them the initial idea of telling of the story of a primarily black crewed ship during wwii had some merit however in less than minutes of watching the movie you find out that the primary point of the movie was to tell about racial tension in wwii the underlying story is about the ship the crew and their exploits in the war this primary point is hammered at you to the point of excessiveness all throughout the movie i commend the men that served on the uss mason for their triumph in the face of adversity and for the hardships that they endured a movie should have been made focusing on the accomplishments these men did for themselves the navy and for their country and not making a movie whose focus is racism during wwii
while others may contend that by viewing other works by bilal one will better appreciate this movie it does fail in one major way it does not stand on its own the plot is a mishmash that is confuses symbolism with substance here s an idea start with a definite story then craft symbolism around it we start with two different narratives this female that is somehow turning human a god that is for some reason being judged but getting one last fling on earth and this mysterious john character who seems to be developing some sort of resort just beyond the bounds of the city why none of these questions are answered but do we care no there is no development to want us to empathize with any character in the story the closest we get jill and even then the development is spotty at best unfortunately the movie gets caught up in the the whole visually impressive which it is but at the expense of motivic development i would love to see this rewritten by someone who could distance themselves from the material a bit and not have to feel that every image has to be in the picture
you know when you re on the bus and someone decides to tell you their life story and you sit there with a pathetic smile on your face when all you really want to do is slap the fool and walk off well i had a similar sensation while watching this film okay i did actually choose to go and see aprile and i knew about nanni moretti s taste for making himself the one and only star from caro diario but after about half an hour of this latest installment from his memoirs i wanted to give moretti the madre of all slaps caro diario was funny unusual and at least a couple of other characters managed to get a word in edgeways in aprile however moretti has exclusive rights to the dialogue so that all you hear for an hour and a half is a high pitched whine going on about how his politics are best or what quirky piece of popular culture is tickling his fancy at the moment he also finds time to slag off films that he doesn t like something i thought was reserved for losers like me surely being in a position like his you d think he d try and make a point about cinema a little more intelligently than this by making a proper film perhaps one with some ideas and a decent structure or maybe one that isn t completely dominated by his annoying voice and when he started fawning over his newborn baby i just wanted to go and be in the company of someone normal preferably not a self obsessed film director with a strange penchant for tacky music the next time someone you don t know tries to tell you their life story give them a slap from me every blow will be a small victory in the fight against morettiism
this film was not nearly as much of a chore as i expected it to be there are a few seconds of brilliance in this somewhat idiotic hardcore ufo conspiracy paranoia fest most of the acting is mediocre but fairly typical for s style stuff replete with pregnant pauses a photographer and a model witness some strange goings on in the woods and soon fall victim to these same goings on flying saucers are spotted more people disappear but is it the aliens or our own government s ultra secret group of cover up guys soon enough a reporter and a ufologist apparently modeled on the character of the writer director are drawn into this unraveling fiasco and become the target of the ultra secret agents who are as menacing as they are improbable and witless then the fun really begins the movie predictably makes about as much sense as the average ufo conspiracy theory but should be commended for taking itself so seriously the camera work is ok for a low budget film the pacing is pretty good the script is silly and absurd and there are continuity issues which are fun to look out for what are the few seconds of brilliance i mentioned honestly i can t say much you without writing a spoiler suffice to say that the end of the film is at least worth fast forwarding to if you can t take the middle
this movie is not only boring it is also really badly done the graphics are so bad they are not even second rate they are dreadful the characters do not show any facial expresssions the voice acting is empty and without any soul and the plot absolutely lacks well anything and everything my year old likes it but thinks it s a bit boring i agree with him
the funniest scene of this movie is probably when our saviours get their medals and plaques and whatnot so the basic idea is the police outnumbers these gangsters by like a million to one but they re powerless because the villains guns are just a bit bigger i guess police ammo just kinda bounces of they decided to shoot this movie in documentary style with fake interviews and all and seriously what is wrong with these guys they re talking like they were armed with rolled up newspapers okay i admit it s probably still dangerous to be in the line of the fire even when the situation is so much to your advantage but don t go nuts and why the hell did it take minutes to solve everything anyway i d say that s a very long time when you have them surrounded and you re allowed to shoot they re like ten ft away they hit absolutely nothing then they go and buy bigger guns themselves to increase their heroism and then yeah there you have it one of the cops actually hits someone bullet was probably diverted by a lamp post or something i had a good laugh i guess
if this movie were more about piper perabo s character and less about the bar this might have been halfway decent piper s violet stanford and karen friendly adventures of rocky and bullwinkle both have a virgin kindegarden teacher quality to them that s endearing here s hoping she ll find a better movie to be in
well where do i start i think it s very insulting to the original annie with aileen quimnn i love the film annie and i was expecting this to be a brilliant film but i was so disappointed the acting is awful the original annie came out a few years before i was born i m now and annie is still one of my favourite films so i was really excited to see annie the acting was awful in the film were any of the characters original very badly written directed and acted this is not a film i wish to see again and any annie lover i recommend that you don t watch this film because it will only leave you very disappointed the young girls singing isn t bad but still doesn t compare to the original
ok i will sum up this movie a bunch of skanky british women have some disease that basically is turning them into zombies the whole movie consists of these women talking smoking and rarely going out for meat or humans to eat i swear i had to make myself watch this movie ugh
okay this is gona be short and sweet review something the movie should have taken a practice ina nd made its life shorter and sweeter than it was this movie is there s a good reason there was a petition with over signatures all demanding uwe boll stop making movies from franchises people liked blood rayne being a biggie there the jokes are good if you ve never heard them a thousand times before the acting is descent but u can really only blame the script for that i even a few moments wonder if they re even using a script the movie has little to nothing to do with the original games hello if you ve played the games u know the main character has no real motivation outside homicidal urges like mass murder because he stubbed his toe or simular there s way too much story for such a stupid movie like i said i wouldn t even steal this movie and for the person who says this is funniest movie of need to take a look around the news is better than this
some films are so bad that they re good this is clearly not one of them based on a true story this film was about as true to the story as pinocchio s chances of becoming a real boy the acting was terrible the direction was poor and it travelled way too fast it was as if the director just wanted to get it over and done with and go home nor did melissa joan hart ever strike me as a talented actress but then every film she made was pretty low budget anyway like most of her other films she lets down her characters by hamming them up too much talking too quickly as if speeding up her words is going to make her more dramatic she really brings out the sense that there is a crew in front of her and she s talking to a camera when she should be engaging the viewer in her character it pretty much lets down the whole film and any leg that it may have had left to stand on is ruined probably the only good thing about the film is when she got nailed in the end but even that wasn t satisfying enough to subdue my loathing for such a bad film watch it if your taste in film is blander than a piece of dry toast
disowned by richard c sarafian this disaster stunk up japanese theaters before coming to the states and going immediately to video where it was not seen again until the turner networks needed something other than infomercials to fill their am am time slots and found this tape at the bottom of their bin the smithee name is supposed to be used when the studio hacks the movie so badly that the director no longer wants his name attached to it but i m afraid that sarafian can not blame the studio entirely on this one the actors mostly recent graduates of overacting deliver one cornball line after another the plot is convoluted the special effects are unimpressive the parts that aren t laughable are just plain boring the script or the book must have been good why else would palance matheson boyle or heston agree to appear in this dud but something went horribly wrong from the page to the screen summary avoid not even bad enough to be so bad it s good
i ll admit that i liked the first one and was really looking forward to the sequel i was let down sure the special effects were technically amazing but they weren t believable looking it looked more like a cartoon alright i admit to liking of the chase scene but the fight with all the mr smiths it was too obviously animated i can accept all of that what i can t accept is that the non action parts were crap every time morpheus opened his mouth i knew i was in for a speech that went on forever and signified nothing i was also disappointed with the little plot that did exist what this movie did was tell us that there was no truth in the first movie except about the existence of the matrix this movie was a little like seeing the episode of dallas where you find out that the entire previous season was a dream ugh i want my back
i saw this film last night about minutes and don t know what kept me in my seat i guess i just expected a film with gere would have some value in it eventually but nothing of value ever came on the screen the story is a silly excuse to pile on shot after shot of bondage and torture there is not a character in the film that does anything like real life the cutting style relies on jump cuts mini flashbacks and overprinting to give weight to this vapid setup of a gang of sadists apparently running free for years and surprise the leader is the victim of an executed killer i don t see how gere a buddhist got involved in this violent sexist trash
roy rogers stars as jesse james and his look alike gambler man clint burns george gabby hayes is mr rogers s ex pal sheriff gabby gale storm jane fillmore and sally payne polly morgan are a noteworthy team as two reporters on the lookout for stories about the elusive outlaw hero of course mistaken identity impersonation is a plot development since rogers essays a dual role rogers is charming as usual but there is nothing really elevating this his performance above the ordinary any potential to deliver a memorable jekyll hyde performance is done in by poor material the better pair to watch are ms storm and ms paye as the st louis journal reporters they are the film s highlight the songs are fine though badly synched jesse james at bay joseph kane roy rogers george gabby hayes gale storm
r there is one good thing about this poor man s pok mon make of that what you will the opening theme it has to be the coolest theme music of any sloppily dubbed japanese made for the consumers oops i mean the young fans anime tv show unfortunately there was need to add some sort of show after the opening theme and they just couldn t come up with something more interesting than people arguing loudly about whose cards are better than the others cards freud would have a field day unfortunately i can t imagine why any kids would want to sit through a show where dialogue written by a thousand monkeys in five minutes takes up of the running time my uber fantastical doomsday creature of ultimate doom will take your measly pyramid diamond animal in a single strike can t you see that you have no chance of winning this battle you fool hahahahhahhaha oh yeah well watch this i am about to use my destruction force delta times pie card which eradicates every single one of your power munchers and renders your uber fantastical doomsday creature of ultimate doom s destroy beyond all significance attack useless i bet you didn t see that one coming seriously that s all they ever do in this show talk whereas in another crappy kids show i used to watch namely the commercial phenomenon pok mon every soccer mum s pet peeve at least the monsters had the courtesy to duke it out every once in a while yu gi oh is just in the quiet words of roger ebert s a clockwork orange review plain talky and boring not to mention long winded i realize i m being hypocritical here considering the sentence i just wrote this show goes on forever i don t know if there s any plot and the static monsters have none of the character of pok mon even when not compared to my fave cartoon as a kid this show sucks it s unintentionally funny but not funny enough to be worth seeing bye bye sleep tight dream wet dreams
this show had a lot of hype but i didn t know about it until the midseason season someone even recommended the show to me but i decided that if i was going to watch it i was going to wait until the end of the season so i could watch it in bulk due to the show s format i m happy i waited i imagine it would have been fairly annoying have nearly every episode end in the middle of some cliff hanger then have to wait another week to find out what happens in the next second of the story somehow this show has managed to throw in too much sex jason will have sex with pretty much anything that moves right after he finds out that one woman he had sex with was killed he s in bed with another woman the next night then tara and sam get it on despite each of them knowing that sam is in love with sookie and for some reason sookie gets mad when she later finds out about it even though she s sleeping with a vampire one of the problems with the show is that it doesn t do a good job of making you care about the characters i really didn t care for jason at all along with his endless pursuit of tale he was rude to the people who actually were concerned for him after a few episodes i wouldn t have minded if he got killed somehow for that reason i was for the most part uninterested in the murders until sookie s grandmother became a victim since the first two were more closely involved with jason then once sookie and bill have sex the story gets a few more subplots tara s mother wants an exorcism then the exorcist lady tries to convince tara that she should have one to remove her own demon i wasn t so much bothered by the whole exorcism thing as i know there are some people who really believe in that stuff however they waste little time in showing that is it a farce right after tara spends about on exorcisms for her and her mother at other points some of the developments happen too fast jason continues being a jerk trying to sell his grandmother s stuff to buy vampire blood which apparently is the new crack or something in his search he finds this girl who will do v vampire blood with him they get high and within three days fall in love with each other and kidnap a vampire for a constant source of v another example is when bill has to go to a vampire tribunal he s only gone for two days before sookie starts to feel abandoned and start to wonder if he thinks vampire politics are more important than her subtlety is not this show s strong suit it doesn t take a genius to figure out something is going on with the local dog although my assumption wasn t dead on it wasn t that much of a surprise but the finale two episodes was where it really got annoying as it just shoved all the developments in your face as if you couldn t possibly figure the out for yourself when tara gets into the car accident the naked lady s face with the pig is clearly shown and was easily recognizable when she shows up at the jail for the bailout as if that wasn t enough they later show the lady again with the pig at her house then it s time to wrap up the murder story at the end of the penultimate episode it s revealed that renee is not who he says he is and most likely is the killer in the final episode they shove renee being the killer in your face sookie remarks that it s odd that renee s thoughts don t have an accent i thought that was fine as it adds to renee being a fraud but the next scene is full of incriminating evidence against renee they show that renee has the tape of maudette with the vampire and his fianc e finds a tape in one of renee s boxes about how to fake a cajun accent at this point it was just ridiculous i mean we get it so blah blah blah stuff happens bill almost kills himself while failing to save sookie who still manages to kill renee they start to set up season by leaving unfinished issues the naked pig lady and sam have a history lafayette has gone missing and might have been killed jason is in the process of being brainwashed into being a religious nut by some anti vampire church which makes me care about him even less it s almost surprising to see how many people absolutely love this show i think i just expected this show to be better i m interested in seeing what happens in season but if i watch it i ll most likely wait for the season completion
wow is all i can say if your reading this is either watched it or are thinking about it trust me watch it i laughed so hard at so many parts of this movie the worst acting ever made is very funny i cant believe they superimposed the school sign i must have played that scene over and over again just to laugh more and more every time if a movie like this can be made it gives us all hope in making our own movies even the costume was bad it looked like my year old cousin could have done a better job on making it heck i bet he could have written and acted better as well all i know is that i have to watch the second part just so i can see if it was as bad as the first its a cool idea about a killer scarecrow but a much better job could have been done hopefully another killer scarecrow movie comes out just not like this one
when my wife and i decided to watch this movie we thought it couldn t fail i love billy crystal my wife loves julia roberts and everyone we talked to said they loved it we were misled in spades on my part i felt billy crystal s character was extremely one dimensional and did very little for the film sure he cracked a couple of good jokes but as a character he did nothing but take up space and poor julia roberts in past shows she plays well as a strong willed self determined lady in this flick she seems completely repressed and had very little fire this is not the julia roberts that my wife enjoys watching ok if i were to find one good thing it would have to be christopher walken now that s entertainment but just like billy crystal hardly anything is shown of his character if you re looking for a night of mindless laughs with very little redeeming value go see it but if you re looking for a smart romantic comedy this is not your film it s none of the above
this movie is just plain dumb from the casting of ralph meeker as mike hammer to the fatuous climax the film is an exercise in wooden predictability mike hammer is one of detective fiction s true sociopaths unlike marlow and spade who put pieces together to solve the mystery hammer breaks things apart to get to the truth this film turns hammer into a boob by surrounding him with bad guys who are well too dumb to get away with anything one is so poorly drawn that he succumbs to a popcorn attack other parts of the movie are right out of the three stooges play book velda s dance at the barre for instance or the bad guy who accidentally stabs his boss in the back and the continuity breaks are shameful frau blucher is running down the centerline of the road when the camera is tight on her lower legs but she s way over the side when the camera pulls back for a wider shot the worst break however precedes the popcorn attack the bad guy stalking hammer passes a clock seconds after our hero except the clock shows he was seven minutes behind our guy to be fair there were some interesting camera angles and lighting and the grand finale is so bad that it must been seen which is the only reason that it gets two points out of
the director tries to be quentin tarantino the screenwriters try to be tennessee williams deborah kara unger tries to be faye dunaway the late james coburn tries to be orson welles michael rooker tries to be gene hackman mary tyler moore tries to be faye dunaway older version cameron diaz tries to get out of the frame as quickly as she can successfully don t ask about joanna going eric stoltz and james spader try to conceal their embarrassment with this crappy stuff it delivers endless meaningless dialog and very little action tulsa is a town with beautiful elevator lobbies an art deco church by bruce goff and a lovely sprawling mansion by frank lloyd wright visit tulsa don t watch this movie it doesn t do the location justice
as others have noted this movie is criminally inaccurate in its portrayal of the artist s life and i for one was very annoyed and offended by its transformation of her rape into a tragic love affair by the implication that her rapist was responsible for awakening her talent by its complete disregard for her work by the way it turned her into a sex object on and on you get the idea also i find it disturbing that people who aren t familiar with gentileschi will see this film and walk away with that kind of impression of her
very rarely do i give less rave reviews on a show or film i dislike on imdb but mighty morphin power rangers is just so painstakingly dreadful it s terrible i wouldn t have minded if this had been an animated series would ve been better that way i guess but as a live action show it typifies the terms cheesy and campy of which power rangers is five multi coloured spandex wearing teens battle evil by using their martial arts skills the costumes are horrid they look like something that is reminiscent of what track and field athletes and female gymnasts would wear the acting is woeful and the fight choreography is so shockingly bad and so lame to watch it makes jean claude van damme look as equally as good as bruce lee which is an understatement in itself in fact they look as if they are jumping and dancing about like it was some version of the nutcracker or they were doing ballet rather than fighting besides there are some cartoons that heavily feature martial arts and yet it is done in a fun yet not so cheesy way that makes it look silly kids show or not this is just so lame and on the verge of absurdity and even though this version is set in america you could be forgiven into thinking that as you watch some of the fight sequences that they were not filmed in the us but rather in japan thus the somewhat fake fighting and footage was borrowed from the japanese version only to be juxtaposed onto the us version if you like this type of thing then stick with sentai the japanese equivalent
you do realize that you ve been watching the exact same show for eight years right i could understand the initial curiosity of seeing strangers co exist on an island but you d think that after watching unkempt stink ladened heroes run roughshod through the bush with an egg on a spoon for half a decade would be enough to get you to commit to something a little more original and interesting and i m not even speaking of the shows validity which for the record i find questionable it s just hard to suspend disbelief for bushy bill eating a rat when the entire crew of producers and camera people are housed in an air conditioned make shift bio dome sipping frosty mochcinno s with moxy what s the appeal here i don t care about these people or their meandering lives i just don t get it but if you do find yourself being captivated by hairy unwashed people i suggest you turn off your tv and just take a trip to your local bus station where you can see people like this in their true habitat they call them homeless people and free of charge you can sit back and marvel in their uncanny ability to retrieve various cigarette debris from a plethora of garbage canisters eventually striking pay dirt and fashioning a homemade dr frankenstein styled cancer stick all the while begging people for change for food when the stink of aqua velva on their breath is enough to suggest otherwise and the best part much like survivor every week one member of the tribe leaves the island when they are unceremoniously sent packing to the local institution when the frightening unmedicated state of full blown schizophrenia kicks into gear now that s entertainment
it is amazing to me what passes for entertainment today maybe i am a dinosaur from the fifties and i am out of touch with todays movie going generation and apparently that is the case with regards to this movie since so many people loved it i found it foul and vulgar i haven t said that about many movies in my life but this one fits the bill the humor is sophomoric and crude i am not a politically correct person and even i found the gay jokes not only not funny but downright offensive i m not gay the main character in the movie is not even a likable person just pathetic when the movie was finally over i heard a number of people comment on how disappointed they were in what they had just pay good money to see
i love julian sands and will at least attempt to watch anything he s in but this movie nearly did me in i m hard pressed to remember when i found any other movie to move so slow ly zzzzzzzzzzzzpop it in the vcr when you ve run out of sleeping pills
this is an incomprehensible horribly low budget piece of awfulness i don t even have the vocabulary to say how dire turgid boring confusing and just plain strange this effort is hey what d ya know i do set in a post apocalyptic america some guys meet on a beach and slaughter and chaos ensue it was all so incomprehensible i couldn t make head or tail of any of it seriously how this got picked up by national lampoon totally defeats me it really is awful and not in a its so bad it s good cult way it is just awful awful awful awful honestly if you still don t believe me then watch it with every intention of loving it then come back here and tell me what you think even gerbils on acid couldn t hope to understand this avoid or even better destroy
i ordered the movie from korea because i was an extra in it and was interested to see how it turned out having watched it i can say that i am ashamed to have had any part of it i feel embarrassed not only for myself but for everyone else who had any part in the making of this mockery of british comedy from beginning to end the film is predictable tedious dull monotonous and cringe worthy to the point that on several occasions i actually looked away from the screen in dis belief until you actually see the movie it is difficult to conceive how un romantic and un comedic a romantic comedy can be it s not only a bad story but a badly made film in one scene you can actually see a runner or assistant director showing the s a s when to wipe across i will post details of this in the goofs section on the up side it did fill me with emotions disappointment rage embarrassment
mulva is put in a sugercoma by teen ape when she awakens she s considerably hotter the parts played by debbie rochon in this sequel and out for revenge on those that did her wrong as the sub title and box art implies this is indeed a take off on the kill bill films but this being a chris seaver s film it s a wildly incompetent satire and i use that last term extremely loosely i d love to say this is better than the first film but truth be told i was so impossibly drunk off my ass when i saw the previous film that i can t even hope to compare the two at this point in time but i must have enjoyed it since i bought the sequel see when i m drunk i like for lack of a better word complete and total crappy movies there are a few laugh out loud moments very few but i do remember bonejack being funnier though well at least at slightly over an hour it is over mighty quickly for what it s worth my grade d dvd extras audio commentary by director chris seaver actress debbie rochon and the lbp gang second commentary by seaver minute making of featurette lloyd kaufman s minute tribute to low budget pictures fake minute syrup commercial stills gallery promo trailer and trailers for mulva quest for the egg salad fiilthy mcnasty the feral man the bonesetter midnight skater demon summer splatter rampage wrestling
or more precisely so bad that you are going to have the time of your life laughing your ass off when you watch it james sbardellati s deathstalker of is certainly one of the most awful productions the sword sorcery sub genre has brought along but it is highly amusing the acting is terrible the plot is pure crap and the effects and photography couldn t be more amateurish but it is the bad acting the cheesy effects and the many errors that makes this movie so hilarious spoilers ahead deathstalker rick hill is an extremely strong and skilled warrior one day a good witch tasks him to unite the three powers of chaos and creation a sword an amulet and a chalice in order to free the country from its brutal ruler the evil king and sorcerer munkar obtaining the sword is quite easy but the amulet and the chalice are in munkar s possession fortunately the evil king has arranged a tournament in which the county s most skilled warriors fight each other until death the winner is then to take the king s place of course the king doesn t want anybody to take his place an therefore he has planned to kill the winner instead of just not arranging the tournament in the first place deathstalker is not only to obtain the the three powers of creation but also to save the old good king s gorgeous daughter barbi benton from the claws of evil munkar luckily he doesn t get bored on his way to the tournament since he is allowed hump the gorgeous female warrior kaira lana clarkson in the meantime the film has many great incredibly stupid and funny scenes some of my favorite scenes include deathstalker beheads a bad guy with his sword the head that falls down however is not that guy s head the falling head has a red goatee while the guy beheaded by deathstalker had dark hair and no beard when the character of female warrior kaira lana clarkson is introduced she is first seen in a black robe hiding her face and body deathstalker s traveling companion oghris richard brooker fights her and during the sword fight her robe under which she is of course topless opens exposing her breasts her breasts are the first thing we see of lana clarkson even before her face the last warrior deathstalker has to fight in the tournament is a giant guy with the body of a man and the head of a pig evil munkar has an ugly little creature locked in a chest he feeds that little creature human eyeballs and fingers there are many other unintentionally funny hilarious and great scenes the acting is terrible but barbi benton and the late lana clarkson are eye candy and although i described this movie as unintentionally funny i sometimes had the impression that some of the actors were absolutely aware of how crappy the movie is there is a fair amount of gore and lots of female nudity to keep the viewer entertained deathstalker is an incredibly awful movie but i still highly recommend it people with a sense of humor will have the time of their lives
the wicker man has done the impossible it replaced cat woman as the worst recent movie in my steel trap cinema mind yes it s really that bad so bad that when sitting down to write this review i thought to myself if i had a choice to either see this movie again or to have red hot needles shoved in my eyes i might actually go for the red hot needles neil labute created a rare movie where joel schumacher could sit back and say with comfort and a guilt free mind yeah that s some bad direction right there i think the first clue for myself should have been the tag line some sacrifices must be made sure it might sound sort of cheeky ominous line to intrigue you but the sacrifice will be all on the audience side of the screen trust me on this the people responsible for this movie should be charged with a hate crime or at least fraud for trying to pass this off as anything resembling entertainment seriously the movie is about an island where men are just there for breeding and i would still rather with be stuck on gilligans island with only pictures of condoleezza rice then find myself stranded there the most entertaining part about this movie was the guy who ripped the loudest fart i ve ever heard in a movie theater that s not a joke nor is it fictional i ve never been to a thriller and heard so much laughter through out the entire film i can t tell you with an certainty if the laughs were intentional in some effort to lighten the cinematic tension or if they just really thought this crud would actual fly i honestly found myself routing for a power outage or a perhaps a fight to break out in the movie theater anything to make this more interesting which is pretty sad since deez powder and i pounded beers each before the film just for a little mental anesthesia soon to be a law before all nic cage films write to your congressman today don t delay at one point i actually thought perhaps this movie is really a spoof and anna ferris is going to show up oh how i wish nic cage throws out so much ham per frame i m thinking of having a cholesterol test done today to think that i ever thought sean penn was a d ck for slamming nic s acting oh he s still a d ck just lesser of one yes sean penn s d ck was lessened because of this film do us all a favor nic play your strengths and stick to being pathetic losers and drunks you cannot play superman you do not get to play strong hunky roles go straight to jail do not pass go do not collect dollars his best moments in this film are when he finally comes unhinged and actually punches out a burly woman to steal her bear suit like the fart not a joke or a functional moment during this review then proceeds to run amok like conan o brian s masturbating bear but with half the hilarity of a bear knocking his junk around thankfully he meets his end shortly after when it turns out he s to be a sacrifice to the crowd at the new tour hybrid show of burning man and lilith fair yes i just spoiled the ending for you and if you knew any better you d build statues of me in worship and sing songs of my legend i sat through this crap fest so you don t have to about half way through this little misadventure i kept thinking to myself jack bauer would have wrapped this case up in minutes of real time ok minutes if kim gets attacked by a mountain lion first even steve martin as inspector clouseau could have figured this out in under an hour and you sir are no inspector clouseau if for some reason you are taken captive and you have a choice to see this film or take a bullet take the bullet somewhere uwe boll is laughing at us all
this movie is a waste of film stock do you believe that the map of a plan of a military mission would be placed on an easel on a patio in broad daylight for anyone with binoculars or a camera with a zoom lens to see it happened in this film do you believe that a deaf person would actually be enlisted in the active duty army in europe during wwii to serve in a negro unit cooking supply services burial detail etc it happened in this film do you believe that a black and supposedly intelligent officer would select this same deaf k p to be part of an active combat mission to protect a dam from being destroyed by the germans before the allies arrived it happened in this film would you be surprised that the deaf soldier didn t realize that a german plane was approaching from behind and would strafe and kill him it happened in this film would you be surprised that a group of american soldiers hold up in a barn at a farmhouse that the germans happened upon would shout out their emotions at the sight of the german soldiers who were just away they did it in this film and left any possible entrances to the barn the germans might check totally unprotected would you believe that over the airwaves and in clear english the captain mentioned the general s rank if not his name as the person he was speaking with and that the general in plain english over open airwaves said that the dam had to be protected the next day maybe they should have just sent in an emissary to tell which direction the american attack would be coming from just to make it a little easier on the germans this so called movie should be placed on a list of the top worst films if it were i m sure it would do well watch it at your own risk
seconds into the opening credits i had this feeling that this was going to be a bad movie but i didn t know just how bad then the actor playing the evil nazi scientist opens his mouth and my friend and i decide that in order to survive this movie we ll have to turn the volume down make up our own dialogue and double the speed on the dvd but that didn t help about half way through we turned it off now i ve lived through some very bad movies before both with and without the aide of mystery science theater and svengoolie but there are just some movies which i doubt even the bots can save the biggest part of the movie that bothered me the most was that the people hypnotized into believing they re zombies had rotting green skin i guess they were all hypnotized into death then hypnotized into rotting themselves stick to the real b movie cult classics like plan nine from outer space
otherwise it is one of the worst movies i ve ever seen and i mean ever my wife and i were both bored out of our minds within minutes not to mention being boring it is entirely unbelievable women non lesbian don t bathe together nor do they accidentally kiss brothers and sisters don t live together well into their s and run around swing dancing together and engaging in footraces in central park men don t find out their wife and sister romantically kissed the night before the wedding and then never discuss it with said wife absolutely ridiculous heather graham is possibly the worst actress in films today she smiles when she should be crying and vice versa the only movie she has ever been good in is boogie nights and that is because she wasn t acting i cannot stress enough how bad this movie was
disappointing and undeniably dull true crime movie that has poorly cast character actor jeremy renner languidly mumbling his way through the title role of jeffrey dahmer who was easily one of the last century s most recognizable degenerates serial killers released straight to video back in early dahmer is an overtly talky boring badly acted and virtually bloodless snore fest of a true crime drama that never truly delves into the monstrous and demented psyche of the late mass murderer like it had the perfectly good potential to do what it does however attempt to do for reasons unknown to me is evoke some sort of sympathy in the viewer for the man by portraying him out to be what is ultimately a lonely nebbishy and severely socially inept homosexual loser who was simply lookin for love in all the wrong places as opposed to the cold calculating and depraved sicko and madman that he was overall s dahmer is one that true crime buffs everywhere might as well skip because i m not kidding when i say that it s one of the worst serial killer biopics ever done it s even sorrier than other pathetic and exploitive straight to video trash like gacy bundy ed gein and the night stalker turkey zero stars
i don t like sean penn s directing very much and this early work the indian runner is no exception the movie has no core it s colored with a kind of redneck anti authoritarian tweeness that in all honesty taints most of penn s work his latest work even more so than the earlier frank miller robert rodriguez clint eastwood sean penn the whole lot seem to produce such fundamentally banal product ostensibly in some allegiance to honesty but ending up being for the most part glorified pro wrestling matches and moralistic almost as if hallmark cards had developed a line of hell s angels greetings and make me long for the days of deliverance which is a fine movie viggo mortensen s acting is much much more believable here than that ridiculous eastern promises thing he did with cronenberg and that s about it the movie is dead meaningless and seems to be an exercise a series of techniques more than a story kudos for charles bronson however who proves he can act and i wanted more of sandy dennis character a lousy out of for this the indian runner crap
this italian semi horror movie starts out very much like a soft core porn movie and turns into a mystery that has a few to many loose ends to be good that and the fact it is rather dull just makes this film rather unwatchable for my tastes the only thing really worth watching are the many boobs spread throughout the film the story has a guy who at the beginning of the movie luring girls to his castle where he proceeds to take them to his dungeon go berserk and seemingly kill them they show the nudity but they never really show the murders at this point in the film then the guy finds a nice red head at a party and proceeds to make out with her and marry her he has a thing for red heads you see as his beloved former wife evelyn was also one she also died under circumstances that must have not been the viewing audience s business after a lot of talky scenes murders start to take place involving snakes foxes and such at this point it is easy enough to figure out who is responsible for the murders and what the motive is then you have a nonsensical ending where everything wraps up not so nicely this movie just did not work for me it left me with to many questions and the last third of the film just did not have the boobs of the first two thirds of the film explaining evelyn s death would have helped the film as would have some sort of ending where evelyn did rise from the grave granted the title is not totally misleading as she did sort of leave the grave just not under her own power the gore is very light for the most part as there is a scene with the foxes and a scene at the end with quite a bit of blood too i just thought for the most part this movie was a tad dull
that s right a movie written directed and produced by fred tepper and family fred should have known better having worked the sets of titantic and dogma so the plot there are some scientists and some forest rangers and a hot chick with huge fake breasts they are all really bad at their jobs including the hot chick who i think is supposed to be a photographer but who cares because she wears a bikini one of the forest rangers comments that the scientists are professional people which is good because it would be horrible if they were professional grubs or jellybeans or ewoks they are hiking through the woods in search of some strange ape like bones and no one even once mentions that the bones just might be those of the infamous bigfoot they just wander around and one of the rangers unabashedly hits on the hottie we all hope he dies real soon along with his sister who s meant to be the cute naive one but is really just annoying then they gasp find a sasqu i mean ape like animal burial ground of course no mentions that it might just be bigfoot bones they re messing with i guess scientists and forest rangers just don t think about those types of things then sasquatch and his tribe get really angry and kill all the people we dislike chases the other losers away and buries his great aunt muriel and cousin josh who died in an unfortunate trout accident all over again insipid boring dialogue i zoned out several times inane plot unlikable characters bad cgi a man in a monkey suit would look better and acting that just wasn t very good all add up to make a movie i won t be watching again you check it out though it s good for some unintentional laughs
the recent boom of dating show on u s television screens has reached a fevered pitch since the first episode of the bachelor unsuspecting audiences have since been subjected to countless clones and variations including the bachelorette joe millionaire for love or money and the execrable married by america hoping to cash in on this trend and simultaneously tap and exploit a new demographic bravo has unleashed the disastrous boy meets boy upon the world and may they have mercy on us all the premise is simple and is designed to be light hearted an eligible gay man is courted by a number of suitors eliminated show by show until one is left but there s a twist half of the men are actually straight this is not much of a big deal but the inherent viciousness of the scenario kicks in after hearing the pay off if at the end of the show the gay man picks a straight man in disguise the straight man wins a cash prize the gay man gets nothing or at least nothing more than a few parting gifts a pat on the back and a hearty round of aren t you embarrassed well thanks for playing just the like the equally painful queer eye for the straight guy another bravo program this show is another example of stereotypes run amok what makes it even worse though is the fact that straight men are playing up these stereotypes for cash the producers of this show believe that all you have to do is put enough hair gel in a man s hair dress up in abercrombie fitch with a pair of designer sandals strip him of all body hair and fat and voila it s the gay equivalent to putting a white performer in blackface and just as offensive to those of us like myself who are genuinely gay and don t dress act like that it implies that gays have no variance or chance for individuality that they can t behave like real people only like stereotypes never mind the fact that the bank of suitors is sorely lacking in any kind of diversity all are gym toned most are white and all look far too scrubbed and cleaned this is another example of how instead of fostering acceptance of gays as dynamic individuals capable of variance and change hollywood has again taken a stereotype and run with it all the way to the bank i feel genuinely dirty watching this show as show any gay man who sees this unabashed parade of soft core pornography masquerading as legitimate television out of
had i watched it in my teenage years this movie was mildly entertaining what i liked about soul survivors were the gothic atmosphere during the party scenes and the constant flips between dream and reality had there not been movies like the th sense and don t look now i would have been surprised by the ending
given the title and outlandish box art i was ready for just about anything perhaps my expectation were forced just a bit to high because i was left a little dry a film crew working on a soft core sex movie end up at a strange house when they get lost in the fog and decide the best way to spend the evening is to have sex where hasn t this set up been used before the difference here is the uber perverse nature of the sex not allowed to show all the goods groin shots were illegal in japan for a long time what is shown is fogged out the movie tries as hard as it can to show the viewer just how unnatural sex can be amidst all the kinky goings on a mud monster whose origin i can t fathom shows up and begins murdering the men and raping the women then murdering them too some of the sights are a bit much most notably a woman having her intestines pulled out through her vagina or another woman spitting out a mouthful of stuff but otherwise the gore is pretty standard fare ultimately the film is pulled down by it s own designs it s too over sexed to be a strait horror picture and too gruesome to work as a sex flick the mediums can work but there need to be a balance
like too many recent british films this one takes a great cast and gives them a flimsy cliched script to work with the performances save it from total disgrace and it has some charm but it certainly didn t make me laugh where are all the great british writers hiding
one of the worst films i have seen to date pathetic action scene and really bad acting also do not help the only good point is gary busey s parts but this does not lift the film very much it lives up to its b film ranking and passes the test with flying colours a waste of my money although i found entertaining to begin with its gets annoying after a few watches i do not recommend this film unless you watch it for free or its a gift a gift you can ask for the receipt and send back for a complete refund really bad

moron and girlfriend conduct some ritual to resurrect the dead in attempt to prove that the dead can not be brought back to life not surprisingly they do resurrect a dead soul who commences chopping them up with an axe and the next day some college aged people are telling the story around a campfire the guy with the axe turns up and starts hacking up the idiots telling the story the group calls the cops the cop sees blood splattered all over and thinks it s a mountain lion and soon after is axed by some deformed killer who may or may not be a ghost moronic little splatter movie which was filmed in broad daylight but where several characters are carrying flashlights and talking as though it were the middle of the night and wanting to send up a signal flare to attract attention one guy has a gun in one hand and bullets in the other but doesn t bother to load it then after he finally loads it he has several opportunities to shoot the killer but doesn t bother to because that would end the movie too early then he throws the gun away also detrimental is characters who show no emotion and don t look the least bit concerned after their friends are chopped up into pieces and lousy effects the human heart looks like a piece of chicken meat the car blown up at the end clearly was a model car and awful dialogue and some really ugly female nudity doesn t help and in the end it tries to get away with it s incoherence by saying that it was all the invention of the same college aged people telling campfire stories at the start of this movie then the killer turns up for real in the last scene hacks them into pieces again mediocre of it s kind good only for some unintended laughs out of
the author of the book by the same title should not have let her name be used for this movie if you have read the book this movie takes such a liberal interpretation of the actual events in the book and its spirit that the movie and book seem to have quite little in common except the title and some superficial details the movie adds nothing in terms of artistic merit to the book s own literary achievement for those who have not read the book you will also be disappointed not only does the plot move at an incredibly slow pace it doesn t offer anything more while it is moving slowly like character development for example some viewers might be entertained by some of the graphic lesbian love scenes later on in the movie but you might as well watch a showtime special for the stuff they show in therese and isabelle its fairly tame and not imaginative at all
the case is the best part of the movie but it alone is not worth the purchase price i expected a based on the true story movie only to find a shot on home video hodge podge of poorly shot clips tied together with pathetic acting and non related slaughter house scenes the video scenes had numerous rewind situations which were used probably to extend the length of the feature rather than for effects i started this review before i was even halfway through the movie and waited till it was over just in case it had a better ending but low and behold it only got worse if i could mark it any lower it would have been a negative ten learn from my mistake and save your money and time with this one
the idea is nice bringing so many stars in one movie is great but too many stories too short and lacking really any sense no connection between the scenes there were some brilliant stories but these were out of the frame reminded me of all the invisible children a movie which i liked a lot compared to it however paris je t aime lacks the intriguing short story which develops starts and has its end and it lacks the topic connecting all those children i do not find paris enough of a topic to connect short sketches together perhaps for people who know paris it is interesting otherwise i wouldn t recommend it
eytan fox whilst generally leaning on the apologist side of israeli politics has made several quite interesting films in the past such as walk on water and the simply wonderful film yossi jagger in the bubble however he has taken this illogical and unfair approach to the extreme far from giving this film a standing ovation the people at the screening i attended quietly got up and left i also quietly left fuming with anger at such a ridiculously one sided film that translates self preservation as racist bullying and racist bullying and terrorism as outbursts of justified anger which implies that arabs are so wronged by the evil israelis that they react in anger to a constant stream of one sided israeli aggression against them and that they therefore should not be held responsible for their actions this film wasn t worth the money i paid for the ticket indeed i considered demanding my money back and was basically an israeli apeing of the palestinian film paradise now if you want to be an anti israeli then by all means watch this film as it really justifies just such a belief system the fact that this film was made by an israeli director and even worse such a talented israeli director is a crying shame indeed just how israel can be surprised to be regarded as a pariah state when israelis themselves make such anti israel propaganda beggars belief what a shameful horrid little film
having lived in japan for several years this movie does not reflect the japanese culture and does not even come close to explain what being a geisha is all about unfortunately a great opportunity has been missed to bring the japanese culture a bit closer to the broad western audience and help demystify the country where zen samurai the geisha world of kyoto originate from some of the most poignant moments of the movie are when the americans are shown in japanese surroundings the geisha dances were not authentic there was far too much use of chinese music a minor but essential detail proper use of the incense sticks was nowhere to be seen the sakura scenes were almost obscenely kitschy interestingly some of the chinese actors were quite convincing as japanese persons
nowadays it is sort of a trend to look upon all shows from begin s as classics people are so easily blinded by nostalgia these days and while some of those shows were are undoubtedly good this one is just pure crap i watched this show a lot back in those days since it got a lot of reruns on tv back then and even as a child i didn t like it even a year old can see how much the people in power rangers are overacting and how much the special fx sucked even back then when the show doesn t resort to the painfully bad fighting scenes it plagues the viewer with this unnecessary soap opera about a group of teens and they r little social problems every now and then i don t know about you but i didn t give a rats ass about any of that at all and its basically filler until they have to fight some dude again in a very clich alien costume with fireworks or some toy robot you never feel involved in some kind of way with this show and the fact that most of the actors act like there really have no interest at all besides they r wallet just enhances the lack of feeling there is really nothing memorable about this show and its pretty surprising that it got so many spin offs beetleborgs is a good example all it is is just a quick way to make some money though i challenge any fan to tell me what exactly stands out in episodes that is supposed to be so good because i couldn t find anything that is even slightly appealing to children my guess is that most fans of power rangers will tell me that i just don t get it anyway or something along that line i really don t care though this was crap back then and it still crap now
slither is a horror comedy that doesn t really have enough horror or comedy to qualify as one or the other it has one scene that is exceptionally good any number of zingers that work but very few real scares and not enough humor to maintain the movie in addition the script does not focus on the hero and heroine and goes off kilter in several places a major failing of this film is that it introduces and then leaves its hero fillion to follow grant grant michael rooker as he is first introduced and then becomes the monster this whole part of the film drags michael rooker s character isn t that interesting to us as a person and watching as he goes through a series of motions while acting in the monster s interest might be interesting if this was grant portrait of a man turning into a monster rather than a horror comedy alien invasion movie in the final analysis this movie s problems are in the script it isn t that important to the audience how the monster acts or propagates the purpose of a horror comedy is to get the heroes backed up in a corner with shotguns and then throw bugs at them with them cracking wise every time something frightening or disgusting happens instead we get an exploration of the alien s habits and tactics that just makes this part of the movie drag the ostensible heroine elizabeth banks as starla grant is more central to this part but nonetheless i felt the movie had left its narrative track unless it planned on following grant grant all the way to the end when fillion and his posse finally confront the alien the movie does begin to cook but once again the problem is in the script by this point that audience knows and the characters should know that grant is not just suffering from some disease and act accordingly shotguns instead they continuously parley in the face of increasing evidence that this is not something that let us get you to a hospital is going to help although their reactions might have been human and real these are characters in an action movie and simply should have done what the movie promised delivered action a lack of action scenes in a movie with as few ideas as this is a great failing spoilers ahead after the first confrontation and the bursting of the alien larval sack a minor character and perhaps the best scene in the movie the script once again betrays the movie at this point one of the characters is almost taken over by the alien and develops an insight into the alien the writer director gunn chooses as this character a completely new character rather than one of already developed minor characters why why did he need to introduce a completely new character more than an hour into the movie that becomes central to the plot by the time this character is attacked we know hardly anything about her and could care less about her even though she is a winsome teenage girl in her bath had gunn decided not to use this character and just used one of the established minor characters he could have completely avoided introducing her family and saved time and money furthermore the hero and heroine would have been filled in on the alien s plans without all the additional characters and could have gotten around to blowing away aliens sooner and with more vigor my last criticism is based on the movie s look gunn is primarily a writer or maybe it was budgetary constraints but this movie looked ugly and uninteresting most of the action takes place at night in woods or on a field and the screen simply looks drab the sets in wheelsy the fictional town where the action takes place look cheap the whole movie looks cheap box office mojo states the films budget was million newspapers say million and considering they didn t use any name talent i would say the money did not show up on screen the monster is just repulsive and rarely looks deadly the last criticism is primarily based on the reality of the character s actions by the time fillion and co have begun hunting grant the alien one woman has disappeared and grant is known to have been mutilating animals at this point i was expecting the fbi or at least the state police to show up and take over from the hick sheriff a woman has disappeared and likely been murdered and a local has been acting psychotic time to call the authorities but basically i was hoping that would happen because i just wanted some characters who would show up and act although this movie is ostensibly a horror comedy the movie it bears the most resemblance to is dreamcatcher in terms of monstrous invasion and the type of monster and its intentions whereas dreamcatcher had much bigger problems with story especially the entire morgan freeman subplot and particularly the ending in many ways it was stronger primarily because the main characters were stronger but more importantly because it looked beautiful although that may be anathema preferring the movie that is weaker in general plot and structural spine because of production values that just shows you how uninteresting i found the look of slither
as an avid fan of cary grant i expected to watch this movie and howl with laughter as amc billed it as a comedy i have never been more disappointed with a film cary s usual charm and effortless comedy are awol from this entire movie he comes across as strained bored and just not himself mississip s character ranks among one of the worst stereotypes i have ever witnessed his accent is terribly exaggerated and incorrect according to which part of mississippi he claims to hail from and whenever he does deliver a line it s several decibels higher than any other cast member mississip tried to make himself stand out in the film as a lovable country bumpkin goofball but in the end he manages only to detract from the already weak plot mansfield looks more like an obscene blow up doll than a hollywood sex kitten and while she was never known in hollywood for her acting ability this film screams that she never had that ability to begin with ray walston s character was sugary and ultimately contrived for four men on shore leave it was the tamest leave i ve ever seen i watched this nightmare until its very end and while i won t spoil that for anyone i will tell you that it s the most absurd you ll ever see the film tries to spark patriotism and a sense of debt to the fighting men but the film misses that point totally because of its weak plot line and weak cast sorry cary
if you hit your teens in the s as i did you probably remember the stories about studio whether or not you liked disco an exclusive club it was the perfect symbol of s cultural overindulgence and self absorption there s even an excellent vh documentary about the club that could tell you everything you wanted to know about its heyday and the stories are easily interesting enough to spawn a very captivating film sadly this isn t it follows the lives of a few of its employees a bartender named shane ryan phillippe a busboy named greg breckin meyer his wife a coat check girl anita selma hayek and of course the master of ceremonies himself steve rubell mike meyers while the goings on at the club are well represented this film concerns itself more with the personal lives of the workers following shane s story the closest the movie works in spurts sometimes it captures perfectly the shallowness of the nightlife culture such as when shane is taken to a dinner party and doesn t know who errol flynt is and other times it waxes into hokey melodrama some of that is inherent in the premise following the underlings as they mingle in the world of the rich and fabulous but a lot of it is due to the kid gloved treatment with which both the club and rubell are given throughout the movie while rubell certainly electrified the scene in new york with his penchant for over the top spectacle and his exclusive hand picking of the crowds each night the rampant drugs and sexuality are only briefly touched on and rubell himself while his excesses are mentioned come off oddly positive for a guy who was in life a liar a cheat a drug abuser and promiscuous as all hell not that i was looking for the man to be pilloried here but his ego directly contributed to the fall of his club and the diminishing of the nightlife culture he helped to elevate a final scene where he gazes down at the regulars paternally is so emotionally false as to be patently absurd meyers does his best to capture rubell but he s given so little to work with here it s surprising his performance is effective but he s good and he helps to anchor the film philippe whom i find generally to be a good actor is hamstrung here by the shallowness and stupidity of his character he s limited to a deer in the headlights smile or a sullen uncomprehending frown and even he can t translate that into a strong performance hayek and meyer are both okay again undercut by the writing and neve campbell prominently featured on the dvd cover appears so briefly she really has an extended cameo for some reason i still find myself interested even fascinated by the popular culture of the second half of the seventies but even given that this is not a film that particularly engaged me despite a predisposition to like it i d say if that era or that club has any interest for you track down the vh special rather than this middle of the road melodrama
first off anyone who thinks this sequel to william friedkin s the french connection is superior is most definitely completely insane or moronic or both the problem with reviewing this film is that a it s a sequel to a brilliant movie which always makes watching it objectively difficult and b it s directed by john frankenhimer one of the best american directors ever so i wanted to like it william friendkin was the perfect person to direct a film about drug traffic in decaying new york city because of his documentary like approach to the action and story frankenhimer on the other hand is one of the most stylish directors ever i e the manchurian candidate and seconds and with his french connection it feels like someone trying to be gritty and not having the true understanding to pull it off that fact that frankenhimer was chosen to direct the sequel by gene hackman himself really tells a lot about hackman s understanding about the original film too it s well known hackman hated friedkin on the set and vowed to never work with him again it s also known he envisioned the character to be more one dimensional loosing weight and trying to play him like a straight character it shows you hackman despite being a great actor had no idea who to make the movie and the story great the plot point of doyle becoming an addict is interesting but doesn t warrant the rest of the film an unfortunate low point in frankenhimer s filmography
although this film was made before dogme emerged as the predominant method of filmmaking and before digital triumphed over strike that you get the point this masterpiece clearly anticipated those developments corin nemec is just outstanding as the ne er do well author and narrator the pace is slow but elegantly so because the cinematography is so beautiful record it the next time its on t v because i guarantee you ll never see a better nostalgia rip off made for t v movie direct to video never felt so good
the premise of cabin fever starts like it might have something to offer a group of college teens after finals in the fall goes to a resort cabin in the woods where one by one they are attacked by an unseen flesh eating virus unfortunately the first paragraph is where any remote elements of film quality stop cabin fever is little more than college kids looking for sex booze talking non stop about nothing and seeing how many f bombs they can get into minutes or however long this mess is the kids act and react stupidly to everything around them one of them for instance discovers that the skin virus has infected her legs so what does she do she keeps shaving her legs failing to take proper medical attention for her wounds the scene is little more than a gross out in another scene rider strong from boy meets world gets bitten on the hand by some kid who only says pancakes and likes to do karate kicks on those who sit next to him if you can figure out the reason for why the pancakes kid was included i d love to know anyway rider pets a wild dog and goes off to wash his bitten hand in a most likely contaminated creek another kid likes to drop f bombs in reacting to everything around him and shoot squirrels why your guess is as good as mine rider strong is the only kid with any recognition in this movie he tries to calm people down in between the yelling and screaming and f y bombs that people are throwing around when the kids aren t yelling they are having or talking about sex or talking nonsense to the other adult characters who are even more if that is possible idiotic than the kids the idiot cop with an iq of at best may be one of the worst acting jobs i have ever seen in a movie you talk about people not playing with a full deck this dork doesn t even know how to find the cards lol i was like will you please shut up already he makes the kid actors look like geniuses the only part that i sort of liked was rider s scary story although gory about the deranged bowling alley guy in interviews rider said that he had a great deal of respect for director eli roth but the problem is that mr roth appears to be going for little more than shock and gore there are far too many bad things about this movie for mr roth to get any credit i wish i could agree with rider and find something likable about this movie maybe the fall scenery in the beginning actually rider strong just saves this movie from being a hopefully he was compensated for this junk
there was a genie played by shaq his name was kazaam and he was whack his rhymes were corny this lines were bad some stupid kid cryin over his stupid dad bad actin bad casting bad special effects whats next this movie sucks prolly didn t make bucks he lives in a boombox not a lamp hurts like a cramp like a wet food stamp yeah you get it a stupid rhyming genie who can t act in a stupid movie with horrible special effects oh and its confusing as hell i m not even gonna go on let s just say it belongs in the its so bad its funny category watch it once with your buddies and get a good laugh but don t expect anything spectacular
after two long long opening skits one of which my brother saw the conclusion coming of and the other totally joke free we start the fast forward fest that it groove tube proper naturally uber stupid frat boys who still mainline jackass or tom green will find the idea of fecal matter coming out of the some tube sex olympics i really don t need to give you details do i and a clown who basically does the not very endearing clown bit i think i ve seen approxiately ninety times now will eat this up like dung beetles well more power to you i just want to express that despite what you ve heard this movie was in no way a model for the many infinitely funnier movies like kentucky fried movie or what not the skit movie had already been done in and now for something completely different everything you always wanted to know about sex and so on and done way better
i feel much less generous with this film than others of its ilk the portrayal of madmen in this century is always done with them being so totally bizarre as to be a different species their antics are so outrageous as to be totally fictionalized everyone is napoleon or some other historical figure or they have a fascination with chickens they are on the make or beating each other up it s as if the scriptwriter said what can i make up for them to do without an sense of what insanity or even mental illness is watch the wonderful human portrayal in one flew over the cuckoo s nest where the illnesses are believable and real i once worked in a state mental hospital i didn t see any of these guys these are too smart and calculating to make them come to life
suffice to say that despite the odd ludicrous panegyric to his soi disant abilities posted here the director of this inept odious tosh hasn t made a film since well that is excellent news as far as i m concerned dead babies has all of the bile of its creator but lacks the wit and technical proficiency that make martin amis the novelist readable when will the british film industry wake up and realise that if it wants to regain the status it once had it should stop producing rubbish like this and make something real people will actually want to watch avoid like the plague
don t see this this was one of the dumbest movies i have ever seen its hard to be mormon sometimes when there are movies like this out there what a sad view of mormon life i can tell you if you did see this movie that it is not all like this at all in a singles ward if it was i don t think i would have made it through it its too bad that most mormon movies are made by a group of geeks who have nothing better to do the acting was so bad that my wife and i barely made it through i guess you could say that it had all the signs of a b movie or are there c movies anyway i just thought this movie sucked and was full of cheese i wish some mormons would start making some quality movies
first of all i became dissy after watching this movie for five minutes cause of the bas screenplay i don t think this movie has any purpose it s boring from the first minute to the last i don t understand why this movie scores so high i gave it but actually it s not more wurth then
margret laurence probably didn t intend on having any of her novels adopted for film let alone the stone angel hagar as a character was one who constantly challenged the social norm gainsay who dare anyone and ended up nearly sacrificing her humanity in the process the symbols in the book the stone angel silver thread etc etc are constant reminders of this struggle of the old and new and the carnage so to speak along the way while the film is reasonably faithful to the plot of the book but it isn t really a plot kind of storytelling is it i think it missed the point on capturing the spirit of the film hagar s defiance for the sake of defiance was not there bram could have been a lot more crude than portrayed and hagar s father could have been played more traditionally so to speak if the filmmaker would insisted on stronger portrayals the film would drive the point straight to home along the same vein why should we see cell phones organic produce and other modernizations are we trying make some points for the sake of making some points e g the muslim girlfriend and the native people hagar and co are everything but politically correct in the book so why should we see that in the film version modernization may be an excuse for a low budget operation but using that as an excuse to send subliminal politically correct messages that are totally irrelevant to the novel and the film seems like throwing punches below the intellect there is also the audience it seems that we have been conditioned to see bitter old people as cute and lovable why should be laugh every time hagar is at her tantrums i doubt magaret laurence wanted her readers to laugh at or with hagar these people are frustrated and are full of angst and all we do is to laugh at them i don t think it did hagar and other folks in her situation any justice
ok this movie could have been soooo good all generations have been exposed to thunderbirds and have come to love it and this film had some of the features one would look for in a good thunderbirds movie the craft themselves and tracey island were realistically transferred to the big screen whilst still keeping to the designs we fell in love with sophia miles was simply fantastic as lady p and bill paxton whilst not exactly who i envisaged jeff tracey being was solid enough but then the adults were taken out of the equation and we were asked to believe year olds could fly tonne machines it s not so much the fact that the movie was centred around the children that made me feel like jonathon frakes was slapping me with a wet fish and laughing at my hard earned money spent on the film it was the fact that alan tracey was so obnoxious in the film and that he seemed to be as able to fly the machines as well as his brothers who were at least seriously these are some pretty damn simple machines to use if this is the case the film didn t seem to know whether it wanted to be serious or farcical it tried to pay homage whilst satirising and it just generally fell flat on its face for the machines for lady p
first of all sorry for giving even a rating of to this movie nothing less than this available the film fails in every department be it screenplay direction characterization or acting to start with the name of the movie is really c class though the movie itself match up to the name amitabh bachchan tries his best to live up to the character but the weak script coupled with pathetic direction ends up making him a humorous character in sholay gabbar singh has reward of on him which was convincing here in aag the figure was crores for babban amitabh bachchan but poor man was beaten by our so called hero s and had only few men bikes to commute with all automatic guns making a sholay like movie in mumbai type setup in modern time doesn t look convincing as for nisha kothari somebody needs to tell her that she doesn t know acting why is ram gopal verma casting her again and again mohanlal was good but there is hardly anything for him to do sushant singh and rajpal yadav who are great actors are wasted in the movie legendry role played by lila misra mausi of basanti in sholay is replaced cheaply in this movie by some gangu mummy ramu please grow up and understand that there needs to be some intellect in your movie enough of stupid characters in your movie like shiva and aag should not say anything about modern jai and veeru pathetic to the greatest extent to summarize i was shocked to see this movie because it looks like a cheap and comic translation of original classic please don t waste money and time on this movie i think watching aap ka surror which i thought was the worst movie possible would be a better idea than to see this horrible package of stupid characters bad songs and miserable direction thanks saurabh
there s really not much need to begin this little review with a plot synopsis i mean it s shakespeare s hamlet for goodness sake probably one of the best known plays ever written i m not embarrassed to admit that i came to this version of hamlet the way most people on imdb have through mystery science theater while the show may not be the best venue to use to judge a movie in this case i cannot imagine attempting to watch it without the comedic quips in a word this german made for tv version of hamlet is dreary minutes no way it s too dark and depressing to be anything i want to spend almost three hours on i ve said it any number of times but entertainment is the thing for me and this wrist slitter is far from entertaining i will however give it a couple of points for what i felt was some reasonably good acting a sounds about right to me as much as i enjoy mst k their comments don t help to make hamlet any more palatable there are a few good riffs here and there but overall hamlet is just the wrong movie for mst k shakespeare is far too talky to allow the comedy to have any sort of rhythm or flow as much as it pains me i ve got to give hamlet a on my mst k rating scale
really started the s trend of disgusting violence masquerading as a horror film i was the target audience for this repellent piece of trash and i was disgusted then as now oh where do we start let s see the setup you can bring people back to live if they died a violent death so that laughably weak premise is the excuse to butcher people in horrible ways because well that s needed to bring them back to life this might have worked if played over the top for black laughs a la re animator or something but no it s played straight there is a whole terrified family in a wagon that gets hunted down one of the few scenes at least where their demise is off screen however just about everything else is on screen there is actually a scene where a young girl walking along is beaten and killed by zombie townspeople who are all filming it and grinning with several cameras then there is a closeup of her face as the filmmakers lovingly and time consumingly reveal in time lapse photography her beaten face being carved down to a skull and rebuilt to look normal again this done of course by a slumming jack albertson as the mortician behind it all he likes to drive around in a ambulance hearse playing old tommy dorcey tunes i guess that is supposed to be cute in the end of course even the sheriff is undead and the doctor offers kindly to fix his rotting hands not clear why the sheriff is not out with the other townspeople killing children with glee and slicing their faces off sticking needles in burn victims eyes etc i wonder really wonder what people see in a geek show like this to give it any kind of rating at all it s not scary the twists are laughable and overall it s kind of sick it s not even well enough done to see it on a dare or enjoy on a level you might watch a bad hg lewis film it s just god awful trash made for people who get off on this type of pointless gore and made by people slumming for a paycheck sad that albertson was even involved
i caught this on showtime tonight and was amazed by how a movie with such a interesting premise could wind up being so unbelievably awful who s your daddy stars brandon davis as an adopted high school senior chris hughes a geek who inherits the heir to a porn empire left to him by his biological parents though the premise sounds like the movie could be a lot of fun it is ruined by inept directing from first time director andy fickman a clich d and predictable screenplay and acting that is even bad by direct to video standards even the normally funny charlie talbert turns in a surprisingly dismal performance as the best friend ali landry is the only good part of this lame and unfunny dud
it s interesting that a novel with no plot has become the basis for two films while the heiress was a good if not entirely accurate adaptation washington square is a heavy handed and poorly acted except for the part of dr sloper film that could have been so much better the director s attempts at making beautiful scenes were so obvious that i actually cringed it has none of the understated and simple beauty that a movie with no plot can have such as onegin i agree with other comments about leigh s portrayal of catherine as an idiot instead of naive and shy she made me despise her not feel for her catherine s transition from childlike trusting to adult cynicism the whole point of the story was internalised just as it was in the novel but we don t have the benefit of a narrative voice to tell us that in a film i think someone skipped adaptation class at filmschool i appreciate the director s attempts to make a moving and beautiful film out of a difficult text but it just didn t work
at the end of the film i just asked myself is it the worse movie i have ever seen or is it the worse movie i have ever seen and the answer is actually after having seen this movie and thought a bit about the meaning of it you just can t find any meaning and you can only remember the two rape scenes which are unbelievably brutal and useless it seems to me as if the director tried to push this question into the crowd s head what are such crimes compared to horror of war and extermination because i noticed that the two awful scenes where directly connected to war and it s horrors during the first scene you can here the girl that is being raped screaming and in the same time you hear one of president bush s speeches about the necessity of starting a war with iraq and in the second scene the pictures of the three criminals sticking a sword in a woman s vagina are directly followed by archive pictures of world war ii but as a matter of facts i really could not think about the relative gravity of theses two different kinds of human horror s expression being done i was too shocked by what i had just seen and felt sorry for bad english
wow this was probably the worst dcom ever i watched the first half hour and i laughed brenda song plays wendy the popular girl with the hot jock boyfriend and stuck up friends who is determined to be homecoming queen she is supposed to save the world as a warrior and shin comes to her aid to help her with her martial arts shin teaches her the skills of a snake tiger etc and she has to learn certain techniques to save the world this movie is great for kids who want to learn about martial arts and the chinese culture but the acting and casting was horrible brenda song is a comedic actress and i can t see her playing a serious role it was laugh out loud funny watching her cry over shin shin couldn t act at all and everything was totally unbelievable i watched this movie and tried to think of something similar and the thing i came up with was the power rangers this movie is so fake and the stunts were so power ranger esquire that it was just corny and stupid the characters weren t likable and i just couldn t stand to watch it disney really needs to take time to make some decent movies high school musical is the only movie that deserves to be on disney channel along with other movies like jumping ship color of friendship go figure read it and weep stuck in the suburbs if you like action adventure and corny jokes you ll like this movie
this oddity in the new doris day collection doesn t really need to be included as she is only in the film for less than minutes what she does do however is shine when she s on screen the near plot less movie is just an excuse to showcase some warner contract players of the day jancie rule shows promise and it s a shame she didn t become a big star ruth roman handles the role of the go getter with aplomb better if this was in color the travis air force base locations with some rear projection work well what s best about the movie are some wonderful musical interludes if you enjoyed thank your lucky stars and hollywood canteen you ll like this one
indian burial ground if those three words appear anywhere in a real estate listing look for a different neighborhood a young couple with a young daughter and a toddler age son move into a maine house adjacent to a pet cemetery and after a l o o o ng hike an ancient indian burial ground seems the indian ground can bring fido or fluffy back from the dead if you don t mind having a raving hell beast for a pet it can do the same for dead people if you don t mind having a homicidal zombie around the house throw in a busy two lane blacktop speeding big rigs a well meaning if somewhat dim old neighbor and one kid who really doesn t get enough supervision and i think you can figure out what happens from there an over the top illogical mess which in all fairness does offer up a few scares well there are worse stephen king adaptations such as maximum overdrive which king also directed but there are far better ones too such as salem s lot the dead zone and both versions of the shining
i m a big fan of horror flicks and zombie films are a particular favorite of mine that said zombi is one of the absolute worst films i have ever seen so needless to say i really enjoyed it it s the best bad movie i ve seen in a long while the story has some similarities with dan o bannon s return of the living dead but whereas that film was intentionally funny this one is the opposite it has some of the most laughable acting i ve ever witnessed especially from the main scientist character his scenes with the general were just hysterical also the effects are subpar and in many cases sloppy and the death scenes are often just downright stupid this of course makes it all the more fun possible spoiler the worst is the scene where the guy opens the refrigerator door and sees the severed zombie head which then opens its eyes and somehow flies out of the fridge obviously pulled out ineptly with a bit of string latching onto the guys neck killing him zombie heads have the ability to float in the air now it defies every law of physics known to man and it s one of the most absurd things ever filmed that s just one of many really goofy moments in the idiotic mess i can t believe it s gotten so high a rating here if you are a fan of bad movies do yourself a favor and rent this sucker
what seemed as a good premise for a movie unfortunately it fails to deliver on nearly every level very hard to follow at the start of the movie i actually found myself fighting the urge to turn it off the biggest problem from a visual aspect is the fact that the camera work is simply over the top with so many arty splicings and semi subliminal cuts throughout the movie that actually distracts you from the from the overall story it really tries too hard to immerse you in the moment and build to a suspenseful ending but the movie just has so many half conceived characters and non relevant script it just leaves you feeling disappointed and confused as to why they tried to go so deep with it
always enjoy great films which deal with the super natural and the deep thoughts of the spiritual world however this film just turned me off as far as its production and direction there is nothing to go into deep discussion about what this story has to tell all i can say is that it was a big waste of time and effort to put it on the big screen the actors namely mark addy thomas garrett gave an outstanding performance in his native land england and we have seen him in still standing a tv series heath ledger played the real wicked dude and we have recently viewed him in brokeback mountain gave a great supporting role shannyn sossaman mara sinclair did a good job of seducing a priest from a church not recognized by any faith don t waste your time you will be sorry
so there s an old security guard and a guy who dies and then there s kevin the world s biggest wuss kevin wants to impress his incredibly insensitive bratty and virginal girlfriend amy as he returns from work to a random house he finds his friends the sexually confusing red shorted kyle and the truly revolting sluttish daphne they are soon joined by daphne s boyfriend the trigger happy sex crazed macho lunkhead nick and there s the title creatures horrid little dogeared puppets who kill people by giving them their heart s desire kyle s heart s desire is to mate with a creepy yucky woman in spandex nick s heart s desire is to throw grenades in a grade school cafeteria i mean nightclub kevin s heart s desire is to beat up a skinny thug with nunchucks amy s heart s desire is to be a disgusting slut daphne s already a disgusting slut so she doesn t have a heart s desire along the way a truly hideous band sings a truly odd song the hobgoblins randomly go back to where they came from then blow up citizen kane cannot hold a candle to this true masterpiece of american cinema
okay let me coin a new word here polyphobia the fear of polyamorous relationships this is yet another in a long line of movies which start out by titillating audiences about some kind of threesome only to turn on a dime and go all preachy about how it is oh so necessary and the only moral thing to find a monogamistic solution only one person in a thousand understands the delight of being able to love more than one person and this director is not one of them bleh mark my words a few decades from now polyphobia is going to be just as big a faux pas as homophobia but guess who was too close minded to realize this right the first time the producers of this movie and so many like it why even make a ridiculously conservative and old fashioned type of movie like this priding itself on being limitlessly open minded about gayness it completely overlooks the fact that we live in an age where monogamy is turning into sequential monogamy which in turn in turning into swinging and polyamory open your eyes people please this is a disappointing run of the mill chick flick but damn i gotta say heather graham is the cutest thing alive out of
people i know is a clunker with no one to root for and no one to care about despite the game efforts of a talented cast pacino delivers his usual tour de force as eli wurman a past his prime publicity agent hollowed out by a lifetime of moral corruption but unlike michael corleone it s impossible to have an emotional investment in this character his dilemma or his fate the film traces eli s preparations for a benefit for a liberal political cause while distracted by a client s ryan o neal good in an underwritten part latest dirty laundry in this case a tv actress companion who s gotten involved with the wrong people tea leoni brings her customary star power to this supporting role although again the script doesn t give her much to work with as eli s sister in law kim basinger manages to evoke sympathy despite implausible plot mechanics this movie is strictly for those who like watching pacino strut his stuff and enjoy the other principals unfortunately between the script and direction people i know is strictly amateurish hence its limited theatrical release and speedy journey to dvd consider yourself warned
i had never heard of this adam sandler movie until i saw it on the wall at blockbuster being an adam sandler fan at the time i rented it honestly i could only watch about mins of it it was terrible do whatever it takes to keep this out of the hands of the public i honestly hope this movie goes oop soon and i hope it stays that way
with a title like this you know not to expect a great horror movie but this was really bad even with low expectations the plot is really insulting and stupid an escaped criminal wears a halloween mask so everyone around him thinks he s someone else this joke might actually work for or minutes but not during the entire movie the actors are not that bad but their characters are rather dumb and the story is boring and downright stupid no suspense no excitement and little gore very cheap satan s little helper tries to combine horror with comedy and fails dramatically at that it became so boring towards the end that i actually stopped watching minutes before the end i couldn t care whatever happened amanda plummer was great in pulp fiction but come on that was years ago and she hasn t done anything decent after that so no wonder that she had to sink as low as this piece of crap avoid or be warned
what can you say about a grainy poorly filmed mm stag film where the best and most attractive performer is a german shepherd nothing that would be positive avoid this travesty at all costs in any case it would be difficult to find since bestiality remains a taboo and illegal subject in the usa i strongly suggest imdb to re visit their weighting formula for establishing ratings since an rating for this piece of fecal matter is absurd i am by no means a prude and have spent many hours enjoying the classic porn movies of the s s but this is inferior product even by the looser standards of the then illegal stag loop
assassin hauser s john cusak mission is to whack a mid eastern oil minister whose name happens to be omar sharif neikov in the country of turaqistan which is run by american interests hauser poses as trade show producer to allow him to get to omar sometimes a satire can be so overdone it becomes most annoying here it does too much the government politics music war people not generally accepted by society and did i mention war and that is what we have here a most annoying movie that borders on a very bad nightmare brought to life i am still asking myself why i continued with the dvd also there are so many cusak family members in this that john cusak appears embarrassed by the family just being there or is that just me it used to be that a john cusak movie while a little offbeat was in the end rather good not here believe that john cusak had a hand in the writing and producing of this mess make of that what you will there is too much going on in the movie accompanied by constant gun fire bombings and shouting that you really cannot focus or was that the point probably it just takes too long to set up the hit which is largely forgotten until the last minutes in the meantime we have meaningless banter among all in the cast and chemistry between john cusak and marisa tormei i don t think so but you know the boy girl thing and they needed something to take up more time yes for what they were supposed to be offbeat and annoying the performances of duff and kingsley were good but when i saw dan aykroyd s character in the beginning of the show sitting on a toilet taking a dump i knew the rest of the show would go to the tank as well i was not wrong i am sure some will sing praises of this effort but if a rose is still a rose by any other name so too is a mess i now remember why i continued with the dvd i was hoping that the story would somehow level out and save itself never did violence yes sex no nudity no language yes
the incredible melting man plays like an extended episode of the six million dollar man but with violence and some nudity i know this film is a bit crummy but i found it impossible not to kind of like it the acting and script are not the best but the effects are good for a year old movie with a budget of the title character takes quite a while to actually melt but when he does it s reasonably impressive we also have one inventive death scene involving electrocution of note too is the music it s insane a cheese tastic medley of nonsense notable highlights marvel at the slow motion nurse who jumps through a pane of glass for absolutely no reason whatsoever be amazed by a day in the life of a severed head beware of the psychotic cannibalistic melting humanoid called steve be astonished when our hero takes a break from hunting the melting lunatic to have a bowl of soup and complain about insufficient crackers in the kitchen this film is just too s for me to hate it it s tacky and trashy but i thought it was a lot of fun you could do a lot worse
you d think that with ingrid bergman and warner baxter that this film would have been a lot better sadly the film suffers from difficult to believe characters as well as a major plot problem that makes some of the characters seem brain addled the film begins with ingrid bergman coming to work for the stoddard family everything is so very peachy and swell the family adores bergman and things couldn t be more perfect well that is until the mother fay wray dies the stock market crashes in wiping out the family s fortune and bergman is forced to go back home to france this portion of the film is a bit sticky sweet but not bad later after the family s fortunes have improved bergman returns the four boys are now all grown and there isn t really a conceivable reason why they d hire her once again as a governess but briefly everything is swell once again but when wwi occurs the four all go to war gosh in the midst of this one of the sons david brings home his new wife susan hayward miss hayward s character is as black and white as the others though while they are all good and swell she s obviously a horny she devil to make things worse she comes to live in the family home while david is at war now here is where the movie gets really really dumb brain achingly dumb hayward begins an affair with one of david s brothers but when the father sees a silhouette of the lovers bergman enters the room from another entrance and pretends that it was her not hayward with jack why why would any sane person do this to save the butt of an obviously evil and conniving woman this was exactly the sort of excuse bergman needed to get rid of the gutter snipe once and for all this is just a case of lousy writing and made me mad and most likely did the same to the audiences back in the rest of the movie consists of failed opportunity after failed opportunity for hayward s evilness to be exposed this just flies against common sense and made the film a silly melodramatic mess as expected however the truth eventually comes out and everyone is swell once again happy to be one big loving wonderful family minus the slut hayward the film suffers because of poor writing hayward s affair made no sense at least in how it was handled and having characters who are so gosh darn good or evil with nothing in between sinks this movie to the level of a second rate soap the only thing that saves it at all is the acting they tried as best they could with a turgid script suffice to say that the columbia pictures writers who did this film should have been slapped with a dead chicken
ah channel of local mexican t v everyday at a m they air horror movies from the s to early s it was return to cabin by the lake the movie that aired yesterday i regret for watching it the original cabin by the lake was a regularly popular low budgeter and it was good accepted the problem is that this sequel is horrible not even unintentionally funny and tries to imitate the original ugh the plot is really stupid in all the sense of the word the movie at some points looks like a soap opera because of it s absurd dialogs cinematography and direction my advice is avoid this one at all costs it s a movie that it shouldn t be watched by anyone not even for lovers of mediocre film making you have been warned
if you look at corey large s information here on imdb apparently there s a movie called reload in production as of june in which he s playing a character named sebastian cole first of all how does such a crappy movie ever earn a sequel and second didn t sebastian get killed at the end of loaded i watched this in the wee hours of the morning when i was battling insomnia and so i was drifting in and out while it was on i m sure i missed some plot points but overall it seemed really weak large s performance was for me one of the stronger parts of the film i m also a bit surprised at all the people commenting on the beautiful girls since i thought the actress playing brooke was pretty but not exceptional
i had high hopes for this movie because i enjoyed the book so much however i don t think i would have understood the premise of the movie if i hadn t already read the book the movie is a noble attempt to show the despair of people trying to break the bonds of overpowering government rule but the book portrays the suffering much more thoroughly the corrupt government officials have comfortable almost luxurious lives while the common people struggle to obtain the bare necessities for survival perhaps most people feel this way toward their leaders and rulers regardless of whether or not they are actually oppressed or repressed orwell s dystopia seems as if it could exist in many places in our modern world it has been several years since i ve read the book but one hears references to big brother the thought police and newspeak frequently in the media and casual conversation probably many people using these terms don t realize where the terms came from i strongly recommend that you read the book
wow the spookiest thing about this episode was the price of houses years ago i ll preface by saying i m not a fan of narrated episodes if the story actors etc are worth their salt they should be able to convey the bulk of the narrative without having to read it out reminded me of personages who can t think off the cuff but rely on teleprompters the psychobabble was tedious and boring but some enjoy that kind of thing it s just not my cup o tea they could have kept the narrative but at least made it much more believable and interesting if it was coming from a psychiatrist or maybe a newspaper reporter or something niggling little things like peugeot being at the house which has a singular half circle driveway yet he seems to have parked his car in the tree he was standing under because it s nowhere to be seen on the road or on the property sloppy editing as she pulls into the driveway for what seems the th time exactly who are those guys you see at m s walking towards the car as she pulls into the driveway of the deserted house the dolly close ups were also overdone like some jr high drama student discovering the zoom function on his camera for the first time i could keep picking apart but that might get almost as boring as this episode was it kept dragging on and the true purpose seemed to be to use absolutely all the stock footage they had shot of elaine driving the newport convertible i fully expected to see the chrysler logo and a nice jingle play while a voice over told us all about the track player automatic top etc the only good thing i have to say about his one is that it just ends abruptly no loose ends tied up nothing explained or terminated not that many would notice i suspect most had already changed the channel or dozed off by the end
ok i ve seen plenty of movies dealing with witches and the occult but this one was just plain weird this movie starts out as this cult of witches led by a really bad orson wells playing the staring role couldn t they have gotten somebody that looked and acted more like a satanist he just did not belong in this movie at all but anyhow the coven takes a new member and stabs a doll that resembles somebody and makes her have a miscarrage the lady that had the miscarrage and her husband go off to a place called lillith on busness and the lady meanwhile is seeing an image of her sister or whoever it is calling to her and warning her to stay away from there and to never use her powers there or she will die the couple after they get settled down in the strange town discover that all the inhabitants are all witches and she becomes nosey and afraid of all of her neighbors and friends then strange things start to happen as the lady discovers a funeral taking place on a hill that suddenly disapears that was creepy as well as seeing the little boy belonging to orson wells at the playgroud that he later asks the lady to help him bring back to life the lady soon tries to escape the town but only to find herself traped by it s inhabitants and powers and finds herself ignoring all of what the spirit tries to warn her about this movie is ok it s has it s moments of suspense but it really could have done much better than to have orson in there
follow up to s walking tall continues the real life drama surrounding tennessee sheriff buford pusser but this installment plays like a lame tv movie bo svenson takes over the lead role from joe don baker but he s much too mild for the part he comes off like an ambling country singer with a bat instead of a guitar good supporting actors like richard jaekel luke askew and robert doqui end up with very little to do i would give the film one star strictly on its good intentions but the screenplay is a transparent and lazy mass of routine predicaments and the production is cheapjack followed in by final chapter walking tall and in by the television film a real american hero
some of these viewer comments are just ridiculous not painful to watch with your significant other i was apologizing to my boyfriend the entire movie it was so slow and awfully strange both redgraves vanessa and natasha were unfit for this especially with vanessa doing that ridiculous brash american accent claire danes was the same wiggly lipped awkward girl that she was in my so called life she has yet to push herself in any way girl find a new way to pretend to cry meryl streep was one of the only redeeming part of this movie she was on screen for five minutes and i swear to god she reached out of the movie screen and slapped me awake oh and hugh dancy who gets better every time i see him glenn close and eileen atkins were also great in their two and a half scenes i mean this was a well shot movie it was very pretty the settings were interestingly dressed providing relief for the intense boredom i was feeling i don t know it s just pretty pathetic when a movie that boasts a cast comprised of the greatest actresses of our time sucks so much it sure had more than a few noticeable editing errors and the main character ann was a huge jerk i was glad she died but that s because i felt bad for lila ann s friend mostly because these two ladies were better actors and made me feel a little empathy ugh bad job evening the film you weren t entertaining and you weren t even thought provoking i sure hope the book was better so it didn t waste even more of people s time
i guess its possible that i ve seen worse movies but this one is a real stinker the plot is unremarkable but thats not the worst of it the directing is no where close to what you would expect from andy ching he s capable of good work but failed to pull this movie together angie harmon playing the female lead as a reporter dogging into who s behind the assassination of the president truly butchered the role there was no chemistry with gooding her demeanor was flat and wooden and the inch spike heels she wore throughout the movie were absurd this outing for harmon places her solidly at the bottom of the b list and what was cuba gooding thinking he has to his credit a number of outstanding performances but this was far beneath what we ve come to expect from him poor james woods and burt reynolds poor poor poor poor poor
when watching little man you ll spend its running time trying to figure out its many plot holes and thats not a good sign because this film is supposed to be a comedy your supposed to be laughing at it but will you probably not the main problem with little man is its concept its far too ridiculous to accept even as a cartoonish comedy so when the loud laboured and over the top jokes kick in they make the whole thing seem ten times stupider than it already is but its a comedy some of you might be screaming thats true but thats no excuse for such a dumb plot i mean come on think about it if you saw a baby with a grown mans face wouldn t you be the least bit suspicious and if calvin wanted to hide the diamond so badly why didn t he put it in a nearby shelf instead of a random womans hand bag and how can a qualified doctor not recognise that calvin is a grown man i mean seriously what its not about the plot its about the laughs you might be screaming well heres the thing see there are hardly any laughs in little man and that just make the dumb ass plot stand out all the more if you really want to watch a wayans brothers comedy with a belief suspending plot stick to white chicks because at least that had a few decent laughs what ever you do steer clear of little man
i watched an episode yes i sat through the entire miserable experience and i have to say this brand of comedy is one of the worst you will get imagine peter griffin of family guy fame now imagine peter griffin as a admittedly slim and minus the glasses woman except that he now lacks the something that made him hilarious peter griffin is an idiot but he doesn t know he s an idiot sarah has none of the genuine character none of the acting ability to pull her character off maybe its the trite formulaic jokes that pull her comedy even lower than her character can take it by herself maybe it s the lack of believable foils her insensitive bigoted persona may appeal to insensitive bigoted people unlike the mass appeal that stephen colbert s insensitive bigoted character has like bill o reilly sarah creates an annoying unfunny character she lacks something that is necessary for the genre of satire let alone for the entire world of comedy what sarah silverman lacks its noticeable and when you don t believe it and identify with it it s not funny anymore
can anybody tell me where is the comedy charlie sheen is a very weak comedian thomas haden church is looking so feeble with him and the whole thing is so thickheaded they tried to make a live comic book which turned out to be super bloody comic nightmare and it wasn t even funny like the plan s scene in the bathroom it was so good with its cinematic imagination but there is nothing more except pain donald sutherland his relationship with his daughter this is actually a kind of work which they made it just to made it and earn some money from it but it became such a crime when this money would be robbed from the very us whom got deceived by so low art work and an entertainment had absolutely no entertainment at all well it would ve been uglier if it was big production and starring brando in his golden years with a real star the sheen s family in here just be aware of that anyone who found themselves admiring this movie or god forbid loving it then you must go directly to therapy before you become more dangerous and hurt anybody else brando undoubtedly is a genius but the movie isn t and he wasn t intending to be one in here after reading this for sure but the main big problem is that no one else ever worked in this thing trying or wanting to be a small time smart or even good sorry i m crying now the movie s torturing is unbelievable there is a scene where brando hitting mira sorvino by her shoes that was so realistic maybe he was seeing himself in her so he was punishing himself for being in such a crap for the milliard time this one could ve been better or less worse the script till the train s heist was nice and i just imagined that they d escape to have some chase like it s another smokey and the bandit but with brando as the sheriff in fact any of those chimeras was much merciful than what i ve watched why this masterpiece didn t receive any razzie award you want to make me believe that there was lower movie than this i do not think so it s a situation where the razzie s supervisor must himself win one for his negligence martin sheen is here also as a guest star maybe for supporting his failure son but ironically the father was as failure as his son and why is that well because i hate martin sheen maybe more than i hate comic movies weren t as good as its ambition it s not a comedy movie no it s a horror one and i just hate horror movies especially those which have been propagandized as comic ones name good thing about it hmmm well this one compared to another marlon brando s monster movie the island of dr moreau would be close to casablanca p s if you still want to know what are or who are precisely the bad the ugly and the very ugly in this movie just pray your last prayers and go watch it may god help you
there isn t much to say about this film it is horrible the acting and dialog are way far away from even decent the story of the hybrid werewolf s is not very well explained and the whole thing has plot holes here and there cgi is something you wouldn t like to see it so amateurish that it makes me vomit the only good thing on the dvd was in the extras the gag reel everything else just waste of time and money i hope noone will buy this this is not even worth renting just stay away of this
originally called the changer the nostril picker is a poorly constructed tale about a loner named joe bukowski carl zschering who likes em young unable to socially interact with girls he bumps into a tramp who teaches him a special vietnamese chant this chant involves whistling london bridge is falling down whilst hopping around like an epileptic morris dancer nonetheless ugly joe tries it out and hey presto he is now a girl ideally he needs to be a young guy in order attract girls but lets not talk about ideals here this film was made in and released in in an ideal world it should have never been released the film asylum dubbed this horror hokum as mind numbing ham handed story telling its worse than that the nostril picker really takes the biscuit in fact the whole god damn cookie jar terribly scripted dialogue delivered by brain dead actors a ridiculous plot and a predictable twist just when things couldn t get any more absurd the story goes off on its own nonsensical tangent for instance joe decides to kill the girls by changing back into himself but i thought he wanted to get close to them not content with being a murderer joe also turns into a cannibal and eats some of his victims of which there were only around the highlight of this terrible movie involves joe picking up a hooker steven andrews then taking her back to his apartment what happens next defies belief joe turns back into a man but also discovers the hooker is a man how does he react well in a benny hill esquire fashion he chases her around the apartment with a bunch of squirty dildo s only to trip up on a blow up doll god knows what patrick j matthews and stephen hodge were thinking of at least this scene paved the way for another priceless moment this involved the male hooker reporting the incident to a curly haired police officer with a bit joke shop cop uniform the hilarious acting is a must see especially the hooker s inability at saying dildo and his demand for satisfaction apart from the above mentioned incident this monotonous slash flick was a complete bore you know a movie s bad when the dvd trailers were more exciting normally i d fast forward to the good bits only there weren t any here the main action sequences involved joe simply stabbing his victims repeatedly forget quick cuts matthews utilizes fadeouts one during a stab scene to limit any form of suspense there might already be one girl s non reaction to her fingers being chopped off is laughable normally i d relish the words uncut but in this case they were far from a blessing just more agonizing cinematic torture the whole movie felt like an unedited episode of midsummer murders only less entertaining i d hate to see the cut version to sum up the nostril picker is the most unentertaining thing i ve seen since richard hammond s o clock show dismal performances made worse by a terribly tinny soundtrack and bad dubbing don t be fooled by the box label this is not a cult classic unless it qualifies for the lets use shitty horror dvds for coffee coasters cult which i think it does unless re edited to minutes stay away from this coma inducing mess
as a premise this backwoods version of the dead calm storyline had promise however director eric red s inability to render a convincing hurricane leads to a deluge of continuity and lighting errors ultimately the viewer is more spellbound by the bizarre weather effects than the intended storyline intermittent spates of ham fisted over direction are similarly distracting charles dance doing an inbred backwoods hardass schtick does his best to save the movie but ultimately undertow squeals like a pig and has more ham to boot
i just watched this film minutes ago and i still have no idea what i just watched mainly i think it s a film about an internet s m star of cd roms that are about as realistic as flash cartoons online she s murdered by someone which causes her sister and a crack team of fbi agents to investigate the death the local homicide division of big city usa is also investigating though most of his work comes by the way of oogling the cd roms which he claims are as realistic as the real thing i know wow michael madsen is the only one in the film that has any kind of credits behind him he s in the film for about minutes and half of that is him banging the main girl for seemingly no apparent reason i won t even explain the ending because quite frankly i can t make it out myself but before the final scene we re treated to a or minute montage of everything in the film honestly they could have ran that then the final scene and it would have been the same effect with the cross eyed direction and all all in all stay away from this film i got it because i love bad movies and i love michael madsen i really could have used that some minutes on something else and have been more satisfied like playing that game with a knife where you jab at your hand repeatedly that for minutes would be much more entertaining
there was something here with the female lead having this perfect life she s always wanted after the worst life possible beginning as a child prostitute and winding up with eric roberts but her background makes it impossible for her to trust dean cain and this utterly destroys it in the end it sounds weird but i like the position dean cain was in at the end and the choice he made he can t hurt her because he loves her and she s the mother of his child i think the time frame makes it clear it s his child and not his brother s but at the same he can t forgive her for all she s done sleeping with his brother which shows the love and obligation he felt was pretty much one way and then being part of his death in better hands this would have been a better movie but for something i caught on late night cable it s not bad

this must me one of the worst takes on vampires ever conceived by men how can one turn such a mesmerizing subject into a totally uninspiring story apparantly not such a difficult task first of all a conditio sine qua non of any vampirefilm is a dark and gloomy atmosphere with a nice sexy touch this one lacks all these things too much light the spots oh my god why in the name of christ judas was that about every time dracula came about he was devoured by light in the script to keep him weak for the record just weak there was only one scene that made it almost worth watching near the ending of the movie beatiful dancingscene with dracula and his new conquest i really enjoyed the first one the judas twist was defintely original but this one s just not good not in any way hopefully the third one will cary the vampire signature i like so much in other classics like herzog s nosferatu coppola s dracula or even interview with the vampire
i think the show had a pretty good concept to work with but the execution was poor the script is poor and acting is bad there were many issues that could have been portrayed in a better way like the protest against gay marriage or finding the graveyard the show can t be properly termed as comedy show as it lacks humor miserably i should say this show was barely successful in putting the life of muslim community to some extent till now second season is worse than the first one i had my hopes high regarding this show but i was kind of disappointed still i appreciate cbc for putting up such concept in front of the viewers anyway i wish best of luck for the future
recap something mysteriously dense that transmits radio signals is discovered in the ice of antarctica the mysterious block is dug out and brought to a research station on antarctica julian rome a former seti worker is brought in to decipher the message problem is that one of the researchers is a old girlfriend of his and the situation quickly turns awkward especially since the other female researchers practically throw themselves at him and the block of ice with the thing inside is melting unnaturally quickly soon the object is in the open the mystery continues though as the object generates a huge amount of electricity it is decided to open the object but just before that is done julian decodes the signal do not open but too late and the object explodes as it is finally breached and two things unleashed on earth the first is an alien that had been dormant in the object and the other is a virus that instantly kills the research staff and washington that is suspiciously updated on this historic event decides that those things can not be unleashed upon the earth so a russian nuclear submarine carrying nuclear weapons is sent to antarctica comments the movie holds a few surprises one is carl lewis who surprisingly puts in a good acting performance and the other is that the special effects that are beautiful well worked through and a lot better than expected unfortunately the story holds a lot of surprises of its own and this time not in a good way actually it is so full of plot holes that sometimes the movies seem to consist of almost randomly connected scenes it is never really explained why washington know so much why washington is able to command russian submarines why the object is in the antarctic and has woken up now it is really puzzling that the alien pod is transmitting in understandable english some might want to explain this with that the alien had been to earth before and knew the language and obviously chose english why but then it is very confusing why the nice aliens that apparently want to save the earth from the virus send their do not open message encoded and finally the end is as open as an end can be the movie is a little entertaining but too much energy from me must be diverted to fill in the voids in the plot therefore the total impression of the movie is not too good
there s a lot of good that can be said for this cartoon the backgrounds are rich lushly colored and full of nicely done art deco details the animation is up to the usual studio standards of the time which are unquestionably higher than those of the present day however i find it tedious for a number of reasons the music it s definitely not up to scott bradley s usual standards although it s probably supposed to be evocative of a great gatsby setting it ends up being dreary sleepy repetitious and monotonous repetitious and monotonous are not the same as beethoven s th symphony attests since most people including me tend to close their eyes when they yawn there s a lot of the visual part of the cartoon that will be missed by the average viewer the storyline i m not giving away any secrets that aren t already in the plot summary country good city bad this is a common theme in films both animated and live from this era it s a misplaced nostalgia for a nonexistent rural idyll which in the present day is reflected in a similar nostalgia for values that never were
this early b entry into the patriotic category slapped a gorgeous young gene tierney on the ads and posters but you have to wait a good time before you glimpse her riding in a hollywoodized camel train previously we ve set up george sanders and bruce cabot in the desert as guys who barely get along but must rally in the face of attack i ve seen sanders as so many enjoyable cads that it was fun to witness a rare good guy turn however bruce cabot s allure is pretty much a mystery to me he s base and unsubtle in comparison but i ve always felt he d just emerged smiling from under a car covered in grease and a sixth grade education some people like em that way as did gene s gypsy queen character this is an action adventure filler tho and just as we ve been warned of invading locals with guns ready to sabotage and attack the brits in their land there is a final gun battle in which we must lose a main character for the good of all this feature requires nothing more than your barest attention on a saturday afternoon a programmer that made whatever else it was paired with better it was almost more interesting identifying the great supporting cast and a surprise appearance by dorothy dandridge in one of her first roles a two or two and a half stars out of five mdm
sir john gielgud must have become senile to star in a mess of a movie like this one this is one of those films i suppose that is considered art but don t be fooled it s garbage stick to the art you can admire in a frame because the films that are labeled as such are usually unintelligible forgeries like this in this masterpiece giegud recites shakespeare s the tempest while the camera pans away to nude people one of them a little kid urinating in a swimming pool wow this is heady stuff and real art ain t it that s just one example most of the story makes no sense is impossible to follow and hence is one that liberal critics are afraid to say they didn t understand so they give it high marks to save their phony egos you want shakespeare read his books
another movie to suffer without an adventure to run no enigma to solve just an illness man acting like an animal no a good reason to take this journey pitt and lewis are great actors magnificent michelle forbes but a weak david duchovny performance
what a stinkeroo this turned out to be at one time much earlier in her career linda darnell was one of my favorites no great shakes as an actress but very beautiful and pleasant particularly in films like the mark of zorro and blood and sand but when i saw this monstrosity the memories of her golden days faded quickly the story is unbelievable and farcical the acting second rate the supporting cast insufferable i cannot think of a more immature performance by anyone when compared to tab hunter and donald gray had to be the most boring leading man they could have picked added to this was the terrible photography and i am not just referring to the color everyone associated with this must have shuddered whenever it was shown
revolt of the zombies starts with armand louque dean jagger trying to convince general duval george cleveland that his mate tsiang william crowell is a priest who has the power to hypnotise people render them under his control turning them into mindless zombies a bit like the people i work with really anyway tsiang is murdered by colonel mazovia roy d arcy but fails to gain the knowledge of turning people into zombies an expedition has been set up by general duval to hunt for the secret since tsiang ain t going to tell them much anymore general duval heads the expedition along with his daughter claire dorothy stone who is engaged to louque who also comes along during the expedition claire dumps louque for his mate clifford grayson robert noland at which louque isn t too pleased about in a way that could only happen in a film louque finds the secret to turning people into zombies by himself starts to use his new found power to gain revenge on claire clifford co written directed by victor halperin revolt of the zombies has a bad reputation after watching it i can see why the script by halperin howard higgin rollo lloyd all uncredited has a good central idea but is killed stone cold dead by being dull as exciting as watching paint dry nothing much happens for ages then nothing much happens afterwards either how halperin depicts his zombies is different to that which most modern audiences would consider to be a zombie these zombies are just brainwashed people filmgoing audiences would have to wait over thirty years before george a romero would define what a zombie is now thought as in night of the living dead at only about an hour in length revolt of the zombies still feels too long technically the film is ok considering it was made years ago the black white cinematography is adequate although some of the scenes look like they were shot against a photo of the background location the acting is wooden largely unimpressive revolt of the zombies might have been hot stuff in but it hasn t dated well in it s an absolute chore to sit through i believe the film is now public domain as it turns up on lots of ultra cheap dvd compilations budget labels but it s still not worth watching no matter how cheap you can get it for
by rights there should never have been a first blood part ii the original script for first blood had john rambo committing suicide at the end of the film but this was changed to allow him to live not because the producers wanted to make a sequel but because test audiences found the original ending too depressing nevertheless someone obviously thought that the character was too good to waste because he ended up as the hero of two more films in the eighties plus the recently released fourth instalment the official title of this film was rambo first blood part ii but it is more commonly known simply as rambo it starts with the title character in jail where he is presumably expiating the crimes he committed in first blood although this is never made too explicit he is removed from prison by his former commanding officer colonel trautman for a secret mission rambo is to return to vietnam to investigate reports that american pows are still being held captive by the communist regime he is under strict instructions not to attempt to rescue any prisoners or to engage the enemy his is to be simply a fact finding mission what rambo does not realise is that he is being set up not by trautman who is portrayed as brave honourable and incorruptible but by the organiser of the mission a military bureaucrat named murdock murdock intends that the mission will prove that there are no american prisoners in vietnam partly because that will improve relationships between the american and vietnamese governments partly because it will make his own life easier unfortunately for murdock rambo discovers that not only are americans still being held prisoner they are also being kept in hellish conditions of course he is far too much of a hero to leave them to their fate and tries to rescue them the rest of the film is more or less one long battle between rambo and a few allies including a beautiful vietnamese girl and the evil commie soldiers and their russian allies most of the evil commies of course end up dead although i was surprised to learn from your trivia section that the total death toll was as low as at times it seemed as though rambo was trying to wipe out the entire vietnamese army the tone of this film is very different from the first in first blood rambo was unquestionably a criminal even though his responsibility for his crimes was lessened by severe provocation and by his mental instability in rambo he is a bona fide all american hero a few years earlier the director george pan cosmatos had made the cassandra crossing a biased piece of left wing anti american propaganda cosmatos however was nothing if not versatile and rambo proves that he could also turn his hand to biased right wing pro american propaganda the one thing the two films have in common is that both are laughably bad first blood had its faults but it also had its virtues its stance that the anti war movement was partly to blame for the problems faced by vietnam vets in readjusting to civilian life was a controversial one but at least the film was trying to make a statement about war social attitudes to war and the roots of violence in society rambo by contrast has very few virtues except that the action sequences are well enough done to please those who like that sort of thing it is essentially a sort of jingoistic revenge fantasy for those americans who were still sore about the vietnam war rambo re fights the war single handed and this time the right side wins take that charlie cong by this point no doubt the film s admirers and there seem to be plenty more than voters have already given it ten stars will have concluded that i am a liberal commie loving pinko far from it in fact i have always despised communism as a pernicious ideology what i dislike about the film is not its politics but its lack of subtlety and its suggestion that the solution to all problems including ideological disputes is to go in with all guns blazing and to try and kill as many people as possible it makes no attempt to understand the political complexities of south east asia or why not everyone in the region was pro american for all its anti communism the film is the sort of moronic sledgehammer propaganda that the communists were very good at churning out themselves except that they attributed all the world s problems to capitalism or imperialism or revisionism or whatever other ism they had taken a dislike to compared to rambo the green berets was a masterly piece of political analysis
this movie is being shown over and over on cable lately so there is no excuse for these attractive women to fight over either luke wilson or the equally vapid villian in this movie the female actresses are very cute and that s the only reason to watch this movie i suppose it is funny that luke s even uglier dorkier stupider friend is around but well that is what we get neither of the female leads would ever ever talk to any of the males in this movie for more than minutes what we get is them sobbing and crying and fighting and so on over guys that were best described in friday the th dead
basically what we have here is little more than a remake of the hilarious s classic kitsch horror death line which ironically was like this cobblers also partly filmed at the disused aldwych underground station making good use of the now disused jubilee line platforms at charing cross as well as the aforementioned aldwych this film contains basically the same plot dodgy murdering mad zombie in the tunnels preying on the lost passengers who have missed the last train originality is not this film s strong point indeed strong points are sadly lacking the gore ranges from the poor to the unnecessarily over gory whilst the sub gollum nutter is never really fully explained as seems little more than an under developed plot device franke polente has little to do with a thin script than run down a lot of tunnels and scream every so often indeed she was like pretty much everyone else in this film out acted by a small dog and a pack of tame rats if creepy films set on the london underground are your bag or you just want to play spot the tube location them pick this up on dvd when it hits a bargain bin if you are looking for classic horror go and dig up a copy of death line aka raw meat if you are looking for a quality well written and acted film you will need to change trains
man what a scam this turned out to be not because it wasn t any good as i wasn t really expecting anything from it but because i was misled by the dvd sleeve which ignorantly paraded its stars as being stuart whitman stella stevens and tony bill sure enough their names did not appear in the film s opening credits much less themselves in the rest of it as it turned out the only movie which connects those three actors together is the equally obscure las vegas lady but what that one has to do with the crater lake monster is anybody s guess even so since i paid for its rental and i was in a monster movie mood anyhow i elected to watch the movie regardless and yup it stunk apart from the fact that it had a no name cast and an anonymous crew an unmistakably amateurish air was visible from miles away and the most i could do with it is laugh at the jaws like pretensions and intentionally so at the resistible antics of two moronic layabouts cum boat owners who frequently squabble among themselves with the bemused local sheriff looking on the creature itself a plesiosaur i e half dinosaur half fish is imperfectly realized naturally but as had been the case with the giant claw which i ve also just seen this didn t seem to bother the film makers none as they flaunt it as much as they can especially during the movie s second half
hello boys and girls this isn t your regular movie review because this is going to be the cold hard truth are you serious this movie sucked so many balls i couldn t keep them out of my mouth they might as well have sprayed me in the eye with monkey semen you d need one seriously large douche to pump out all the vaginal fluid from this movie the plot was very lacking the actors were terrible i rewound the dance number several times and had to pause it even more because i was choking on my own spit do boys everyone peace r h besties lyf
i watched it with my mom and we were like what the hell we didn t get it at all i may have this wrong but a chair had something to do with the death of this woman s father that movie was terrible this is not a movie for those who love a good suspense movie bad suspense movie shakes cane at movie i m never seeing it again and i m a big fan of lifetime movies too they kinda need to quit trying to make movies outta books it s driving me crazy and whit was butt ugly and yet she loves him more than hugh who was a tiny bit nicer looking my rating
i saw and liked the first two a lot really especially because the second is not just a try to make another one as good as the first and it s a story standing alone you don t have to know the first movie i liked that in the free willy movies too but the third here is absolutely useless i tried it with a friend of mine because we both liked the first two we decided to stop after a good half an hour the movie is okay there are funny parts in it alright but what for timon and pumba were funny creatures in the first two movies what lion king is for me is a hard attempt to get even more fun of the first movie than it had already plus telling the story from their point of view but what for i d really like to know you know the idea of the two of them sitting in the cinema watching the first one is really nice but what comes after is mostly unnecessary i guess many people liked timon and pumba and so do i really yet for me many parts were very constructed with a try to be funny no chance most of it wasn t funny at all at least for me btw what was the movie about anyway was it a about timon and pumba or b an attempt to get more fun out of the first movie i tend to choose option b and i m very disappointed about it if you like to see stories like the story behind xy you should see rosencrantz and guildenstern are dead by tom stoppard with tim roth and gary oldman that s really funny and no try to get more out of hamlet then it has
the plot and characters are ridiculous and barely qualify as plot and character the biggest problem is the fact that everything is dark out of focus and blurry the fact that fulci filled the whole movie with mist doesn t help on the other hand the whole thing is completely bizarre and filled with sex and violence the inconsistencies are pretty entertaining one of the main characters says he has no friends yet he latches onto the new guy in a minute of screen time and has a whole gaggle of women on the side though he does show his anti social tendencies by randomly putting an arrow in some poor b d who s just minding his own business images of blood or gore flowing get more attention than the characters but what do you want from fulci maybe it ruined his career but it wasn t really much more stupid than zombie worth a rental if you like gory italian flicks or are desperate for sword and sorcery or something bizarre how do you sleep through someone getting sucked into a pit feet from your head and screaming for help
igor and the lunatics is a totally inept and amateurish attempt at a crazy hippie cult killing spree horror movie apparently even nearly twenty years later charles manson was still inspiring overenthusiastic but incompetent trash filmmakers this is a typical troma production meaning in other words there s a lot of boring and totally irrelevant padding footage to accompany the nonsensical plot there s a bit of random gore and gratuitous nudity on display which isn t bad but it s all so very pointless and ugly that it becomes frustrating to look at igor and the lunatics is so desperate that it s even using a lot of the footage twice like the circle saw killing for example the incoherent plot tries to tell the story of a hippie cult run by the drug addicted and charlie manson wannabe paul one of paul s lower ranked disciples named igor becomes a little bit too obsessed with the bible stories and drug orgies and gradually causes the entire cult to descent further into criminal insanity just to illustrate through a little example exactly how crazy igor is he tears the heart straight out of the chest of a really sexy black hitch hiker girl there s an annoying synthesizer soundtrack and some truly embarrassingly lame pseudo artistic camera tricks like slow motion footage and lurid dream sequences maybe there s one sequence that more or less qualifies as worthwhile for trash fanatics and that is when a poor girl is cut in half with a machete for no particular reason the camera holds the shot of the blade in the bloodied stomach for fifteen whole seconds
uh oh another gay film this time it s showing the black side bet your last dollar it s gonna have an unhappy ending but why with only less than a half dozen exceptions all gay films have to end in death or an addio finale it s like all the european film noir releases in the s s s and s the lead male or female must die or ride off alone into oblivion why in god s name must writers directors and producers have the audience leave the theatre feeling depressed after all it s supposed to be gay not glum maybe the category should be changed to a glum film a large percentage of gay relationships do last and the couples do ride off together into the sunset no matter who writes or produces he only shows the down side of gay life and gives the incorrect impression of gay lifestyle this movie just proves my point if you rent the dvd take an antidepressant for here comes another gay film this is wrong
st watched out of dir sydney pollack dvd version i watched titled days of the condor so so cia drama full of laid back performances making for a very laid back movie the premise of the story revolves around out of members of a cia research group being killed with robert redford s character codename condor being the one that was left who killed them and why that s what redford tries to find out while trying to not be the th victim at the same time along the way he gets faye dunaway s character involved involved originally because he needs a place to hide and then she eventually helps him out after a little lovey dovey time this is one of a handful of innocent guy on the run stories but this one doesn t have a lot of suspense the flat performances don t help and the finish doesn t seal the deal for the audience enough either despite having a good director in sydney pollack and a group of classic performers the story and the performances are not what they should be and therefore the movie is not what it should be
story goes like this netflix was late sending me my dvds so i went on down to the the analog rental place known as blockbuster video they suck you know real bad they have copies of the latest lame movies for your viewing pleasure yet i never want to see any of those so i saw btk killer there on the shelf all by its lonesome self i like seeing films based on serial killers its just a part of humanity that i will never understand therefore i wanna see that kind of stuff anyways i put this dvd in and all the sudden from the very first second it sucks i m sitting there with my b f and we are like what is this kind of crap unsteady camera operation horrible acting the first scene in which a woman gets killed you wonder if she would rather just calmly gab instead then a rat gets stuffed down her throat i really wonder if the director has a hard on for this crap there is nothing decent about this film all i have to say to the director is do you own a freakin tripod every shot was brutally unstable the music was awful it was like they just decided one day to make a movie they were probably gathering people from walmart to show up and act for them just plain awful if you make a movie like this then directing is your hobby not what you should be doing for a living should not make it to the dvd renal outlets for movie buffs like myself better left at home for your friends when you are having a party and run out of interesting things to entertain them with then you break out your btk killer film and say wanna see this crappy movie i did once
irene dunne finished her illustrious career with this so so movie she should have gone out with a bang being the classy actress she was not in this unmemorable almost unknown film this lightweight comedy is okay but nothing special the first half of it is far better as it gets pretty stupid in the second half maybe irene could see the handwriting on the wall and quit even her high pitched voice got a bit annoying in here rumor has it she was not happy with this film one can see why the story reminded me of a s television sitcom speaking of that i thought david nelson from the ozzie harriet tv show was in this movie but it turned out to be a very young richard crenna he looked and sounded just like nelson overall so so at best and a sub par ending for a great actress
i gave timecop a perfect i gave this it s story is very boring and it has only little to do with the original timecop lots of things from timecop was scrapped and they put in new stupid stuff instead this story is taking place in if i remember correctly but for some reason the timetraveling is now more dangerous confused and the action scenes are nothing to be happy about well most of them aren t only the first one is great and there aren t many action scenes at all and they re all pretty shortat one point in the story the main character travels through time about times within a few minutes no wait make that two times in short don t waste time watching this movie it s not worth it
well awful is just the first name this movie is a clich ridden piece of junk a high school comedy setup in a military training camp i m sorry i had to give this star which it did not deserve this may contain spoilers just about everything is totally forced unconvincing and unrealistic the hepo military police will not come to get you if you don t make your appearance especially not on your wedding day the actors were pretty embarrassed during this scene because the scene didn t work as it was so highly unlikely you can sense it in their voices even if they were not such bad actors they wouldn t have been able to save the scene next the guy has to exercise in his wedding suit no there was no time to get him an uniform first man this is great cinematography i will remember this scene for the rest of my life there are also girls in the camp exciting one of em even a model though not looking that great and the baddest actress i ve ever seen i doubt in hollywood they would let her say a single line in a b movie okay girls in the military now this is getting fun the girls are even placed on the same floor so we can sneak to their room at night in reality they would be placed in a different building a quarter mile away separated by two fences with barbed wire there are tanks available we can use for a fun ride in our spare time of which we have plenty no the tanks are not locked and the ignition keys are inserted no one will notice the engine sounds especially not at night there is a bunch of sex scenes and references and all are below the waste line we need those so the sexually obsessed germans will like the movie as well switzerland is too small a market for any feature film well done one sex scene takes place in the kitchen surely none of those facilities are ever locked the military routines are as sloppy as they can get in the end of the brainless flick the mafia hit men are about the take revenge on the poor guy trying to shoot him because he deserted his fianc e sure i buy that the italians are that way a jealous bunch not the bad guys attempt to do this in open daylight with two dozen eyewitnesses not at night in a dark alley again military training grounds where there is shooting with live ammo are open to the public anyone can freely drive or walk in there there are no such things as guards or fences the deed however is prevented by the good captain timely launching a rocket into the italians car the explosion knocks the hit men and the enraged fianc e off their feet no one in feet distance is hurt when the car is blown to smithereens it s a comedy remember okay it s a comedy i got that and i can live with that no realism needed filmmakers can easily get way with this if it is hilariously side splitting funny or entertaining interesting challenging unfortunately it is none of those it s just embarrassing a rip off from brainless american comedies the latter are at least done professionally with no amateur actors it is pretty boring and predictable a waste of time and energy especially to those sitting through the entire movie as i unfortunately did yawn
watching speak easily is painful for fans of buster keaton seeing such a phenomenal writer actor comic director and stunt man subjected to this humiliating spectacle is like seeing a picasso used as a drop cloth or perhaps more like seeing the finest camembert adulterated with whey solids and processed into cheez whiz keaton is ill cast as professor post whose overblown vocabulary is the only thing keeping him from saying tell me about the rabbits george post would have said something like kindly inform me as to the status of the small mammals in the family leporidae of the order lagomorpha kind sir who i believe is primarily addressed with the epithet george when keaton created his own characters they might be situationally clueless but they weren t stupid they were quick studies and became masters of their worlds not so with post who never stops stumbling and bumbling and who who has no more control of his destiny than a bilge rat had of the titanic and while keaton s original characters had a charming naivet and innocence post comes across as such a profound sexual retardate that if he ever did become physically aroused he d put an ice bag on the swelling and seek medical help there are a couple of small redeeming moments such as keaton s attempts to get rid of the vampish thema todd or his suggestion as to appropriate attire for a greek dance but it s just not worth enduring the entire film to see them if you re a fan of bad movies get drunk and watch speak easily with friends a la mystery science theater but other than that stick with the silents let them be of what buster keaton is remembered for
i rarely comment on films but i ve read the other comments and i cannot believe that there are people applauding this celluloid rubbish i know there are certain people who have their own agenda but lets take it on merit poorly acted badly shot and the story felt as the director was making it up as he was going along i am not going to focus on the sexual aspect of the film involving little kids as the makers of the film obviously knew what they wanted and what their audience would want all i can say is it is a terrible film the content is poor and offensive the production is amateurish and i am glad they could not make a film like this legally today
this movie is now my gauge against which all other movies will be compared as in was it as stupid as revolver i too was in the toronto international film festival audience last night where a room filled with over people walked out in an eerie silence after being absolutely dumbstruck by hours of sheer nonsense jason stratham would have been amazing if only he had a purpose within the first minutes he s given a proposition by andre and big pussy of soprano s fame which makes no sense at all then there s some shooting and then there s ray liotta wearing embarrassing bikini briefs then there s some animation ray liotta s naked butt lots of shooting teeth gnashing art house wanna be pretensions and more of liotta s embarrassing body that elicited laughs at every showing which i m not quite sure was the reaction he was looking for not times anyway everyone in this movie thinks they re smarter than the average bear and guy ritchie thinks he s yogi bear incarnate the story lines might have went nowhere but the posturing was outta sight the only way this movie could have been worse is if madonna herself was in it
nobody knows anybody is a conspiracy theory thriller about a satanist nut bomber targeting the religious festivities of seville during holy week he also happens to be the best friend of the film s hero the plot is set up by the bomber as a computer game with himself and the hero as players and seville as the virtual environment the very real alleys and streets of the city begin to take on the labyrinthine qualities of those old pacman type games looked at this way the scene where the hero and his female sidekick are chased by black hooded penitents with rayguns may not seem as silly as it plays from the start we are aware that the narrative is being constructed as a game the hero s job is to create crossword puzzles for a popular newspaper at one point the crossword grid on his screen becomes the chessboard on which he is later playing against his girlfriend s father clues are liberally scattered as the camera mystifyingly closes in on images that are only later shown to have been significant e g the advert in the bar the detective paper chase elements are made part of a game in progress rather than an investigation after the fact the film borrows heavily on se en s pattern narrative and anyone with a catholic education will presumably get the significance of certain events happening on certain days in the run up to easter in this reading the game is on the level of narrative with the hero fighting against an enemy in this case the computer to win and save the day but there is a second game the film itself which subvert the first there are another set of of clues which point not to the killer s intentions but the filmmaker s and his hero s in the first ten minutes there are references to chess a writer called navokov and a cult leader called sarin if we remember that the chess loving nabokov s s pseudonym was sirin we see another game afoot one where we suspect not the villain but the hero himself in a nabokov novel like pale fire an author figure creates a text which is designed to hide his own motives provoking a game between writer and reader to uncover the real text throughout the film are scenes which are visually distorted e g the image contracting or which are ambiguously defined dreams and hallucinations that make us suspect the hero s point of view the opening references to games are all linked to him in the early sequences much is made of the character s sexual and creative impotence so the film could be his attempt to master his life to be a winner in a way he can t for real no sooner has he won the game than his writer s block vanishes the words he types are the title of the film suggesting he is the overall author further that title in spanish reflects on itself negatively a very nabokovian involution that suggests a hero like kinbote trapped in his own solecism this jumble of post modern literature borges eco pynchon et al are alluded to also fincher x files run lola run chris marker the idea of the city and its history as a map and a text and as a cultural history haunting the present bunuellian anti clericism and alex de la iglesia s shock films result in a film that is just that a jumble each clever clever allusive element cancelling out the last dissipating interest the lack of clarity about the game s rules renders it incomprehensible and eventually wearing ironically in a work of such overdetermined artifice the film s main interest lies in its documentary quality as a record of a narrative taking place in a real city with its own events taking place independently such an ambiguous blurring of fact and fiction can create a masterpiece like sans soleil or london but ultimately you need to have a light touch to match your cleverness
there s nothing i hate more than self congratulating pretentiousness kevin smith deserves to be hung up by his toenails for inspiring every white middle class whiner to make a movie about why they can t get laid i don t really mind inexperience and low budget productions but when the writing is this obvious and cloying it really burns my potatoes the money put into this could ve gone to a real struggling filmmaker who actually has a chance like john gulager if you watch project greenlight you ll immediately recognize a talented visionary who is fighting against the system anybody could grab a camera and make a talkative picture that doesn t manage to say anything really at all when will we be saved from the smithonites and whedonettes of the world the revolution can t come soon enough go watch a real first time effort by buying desperado or searching out friends with benefits thank you and good day
what in god s name happened here how does one go about creating what is practically a cheap knockoff of redneck zombies was zombie ever supposed to entertain someone anyone or even make a dollars profit but mainly what happened here zombie extreme pestilence was directed by a lunatic by the name of andreas schnaas who specializes in earth shattering gore films such as goblet of gore and anthropophagus and some of which contain profanity in the titles in the gore department this one isn t much different than the rest although the level of ineptness well earth shattering zombie extreme pestilence is as bad as peter jackson s dead alive is gory think about it getting too specific with the story would be a waste of time an accident involving chemicals causes the dead to come back and eat the living never has the concept been treated in such a manner the gore effects are a whole new low just a z grade nightmare i can t tell whether or not this was originally meant to be funny somehow i doubt the english dubbing was being very true to the original script but stranger things have happened the whole thing just reminds me of a shot on video introduction to a troma movie except it lasts a hell of a lot longer i ve seen only one film that was worse than this the chooper for proof that andreas schnaas is an actual director i would highly recommend nikos the impaler if you think you have no standards in what you look for in a bad movie give extreme pestilence a try but you ve been warned it takes nerves of steel to make it all the way through but if gore is all you re here for then you might be able to stomach this one other than that no atmosphere no and i mean no budget no entertainment value but mostly no pride show some pride schnaas updated after a few more viewings of zombie i ve had a change of heart or i guess i just get it now zombie is hilarious so nevermind the harsh words although extreme pestilence still only deserves one star
this was a terrible film there was no story line whatsoever to top it all off when they couldn t explain the blood and gore the only good part they threw in a few aliens i hate when directors or whatever run out of ideas and then blame the aliens watch this film if you like but don t say i didn t warn you two things how could vinny say welcome when he didn t have a tongue its a pity mr jones didn t have a bigger role second thing that bugged me why were we shown vinny jones boils and him cutting them off and putting them into blue liquid then these have no further role why not i don t like to be shown something and that has nothing to do with the story line whatsoever in short bad story i wouldn t waste my time wish i d have watched mirrors instead
ever notice how in his later movies burt reynolds laugh sounds like screeching brakes must have been hanging out with hal needham too much and from the looks of stroker ace way too much can you believe this was based on a book neither could i but it was and probably not a best seller i ll wager burt s another good old boy in the nascar circuit who hitches up with beatty as a fried chicken magnate with designs on his team anderson provides what love interest there is and nabors does his umpteenth gomer pyle impression as faithful mechanic best friend lugs a lot of people here are friends of burt s or hal s others must have needed the work and even real nascar drivers get in on the act and look to have more talent than those with sag cards as far as laughs go bubba smith pre police academy gets them as beatty s chauffeur and petersen in full elvira mode gets lots of appreciative leers as a lady who wants to get to know lugs real well real well it s a shame that burt threw away as much time and effort in a film like stroker ace where it didn t matter whether he bothered to act or not they didn t bother to write a character for him why bother to act two stars mostly for petersen and for the out takes at the end now they re funny
the word in the summary sums it up d oh five girls get lost trying to find their way home when they stop at a store to get directions they hit a parked car breaking one headlight on it they flea the scene in fair of getting in trouble but suddenly they see one headlight coming up behind them ooooh from there out everything is screaming crying and violence when they try to get away from this crazy person who lost it because of a headlight well the screaming and crying pretty much stays through the entire movie very annoying the movie is shot with a cheap camera trying to make it seem real or shocking i guess it s just embarrassing and useless though in lack of anything better to compare it with blair witch style the screaming and crying for pretty much the entire movie with crappy sound was over the top annoying you literally get a headache i m sorry but this was not scary only an annoying painful piece of crap movie
i feel like i ve just watched a snuff film a beautifully acted taut engrossing and horrible thing a two hour litany of perversion in the most basic and all inclusive sense of the word sexual violence and torture rape decapitation incest corruption live burial and abuse abuse abuse no redemption whatsoever and i was entertained i couldn t stop watching what does this say about me about the people who make and act in this sort of thing and a world that has become so desensitized that eventually real snuff films will be the norm and i m neither puritanical nor humorless i don t try to hide from the existence of darkness and i definitely have not led a sheltered life but i am ashamed of myself and i m sorry to see my british cousins dragging the subject matter sewers the way my own tribe does it doesn t have to be cozy but does it have to wallow in vicarious sadism
i loved the first season the quality went down a little bit in the second season which however had a great middle pegasus third season was fairly novel and original and was ok fourth season started going downhill fast because they never even began giving us any explanations when by now we were really starting to need them what the hell was the cylon plan why were there two cylon factions what was the point of angel kara leading the fleet to a devastated earth what kind of a past did the last five cylons have and how did they survive or were they reincarnations questions everywhere answers nowhere and then comes the end earth our earth in the past well okay but destroying the fleet giving up technology and giving up any kind of urban life and spreading a few thousand people paper thinly across the planet that s not only anti science it s anti reason and anti life and the philosophy of the show then seems to be that humanity is forever trapped in a cycle going from nature romanticism to a decadent capitalist society inventing destructive a i that ruins everything it is without vision without hope for a grander future for humanity and it is antithetical to proper science fiction and don t even get me started on the angels religious claptrap of the worst kind the ultimate disappointment the whole all this has happened before and will happen again thing should have related to the previous incarnation of the series not just to earth as we know it making the new show somehow consistent with the old would have been the definitive stroke of genius frakkin shame out of
rather then long dance sequences and close ups of the characters which made the film drag on the movie would have been better served explaining the story and motivations of the characters the marginalisation of nubo the minister auntie mother and the dumbing down of the dynamic and important rivalry between hatsumo and mameha and hatsumo and sayuri made the movie lack any real depth if you hadn t read the book you would not really understand why sayuri loved the chairman and why mameha became her mentor at all visually the film was stunning and the actors all did the best with the c rate script they were given but that was all that was good about this movie
i wanted to like magnolia the plot reminded me of grand canyon which i liked different lives stories that come together at the end but magnolia took a wrong turn halfway through the movie and i was lost i almost turned it off right then and there but i felt i should hang in there until the end little did i know it would be another torturous hours thank god i rented instead of seeing it in the theatre i almost screamed out in frustration after hours the biggest kick in the pants was the ending frog scene my dvd player still hasn t forgiven me and i don t blame it one bit it was a unique movie but a bad boring and pointless movie
there is only one problem with this website you can t give a negative rating additionally a mate rated this as a d grade movie i say he was being too nice a piece of wood could show more emotion that the actors in this movie and the money used to produce this movie would have been better used to start a fire this is absolutely terrible hours of life that anyone who endures this untalented bloodbath will never get back after watching minutes myself and the boys wondered if sinking bulk heavies would make this anymore entertaining half a carto and a bottle of later i finally found some of this g grade acting remotely funny it s an insult upon this entire planet that the director thought anyone could find anything beneficial from this more he should go and buy a rope and to the actors in this flick i hope you got paid well to be in this joke because i doubt you will ever work again in summary i fine everyone in this movie grand and demerit points off your acting licence
okay if you ve seen the ring you ve basically seen the grudge it s trying to be scary by just having freaky camera work and loud sounds but it fails miserably the plot if you can call it that is weak and rather full of holes for instance how would the care center have known that yoko didn t show up for work when the people who lived in the house were not there and it s not really clear what bill pullman s character had to do with anything he just kind of came out of nowhere to advance the plot it didn t make a lot of sense what happened to the original family who was hanging in the room the little boy or the dad and was yoko alive or dead when the care center guy found her there were too many unanswered questions and i was too bored to think about it more
if another hitler ever arises it will be thanks in part to nonsense like this film which propagates the absurd notion that he was a visibly deranged lunatic from the start far from following such a person and electing him to the highest office in the land sane people would cross the street to avoid him and he would have died in a ditch nameless and unknown anyone who reads the accounts of hitler s close companions the autobiography of his secretary traudl junge for instance will be struck by the fact that people found him a kindly intelligent generous man he was also a brilliant orator and the fact that his speeches seem overblown and ranting to modern ears ignores the times in which they were made when strutting pomposity was common in political speeches ditto the overstated anti semitism which was neither a central plank of the early nazis who were primarily anti communist nor uncommon or unusual for the times the film makes it look as though hitler s sole ambition from the start was the holocaust if you want to identify the next person who will cause the death of tens of millions you can ignore fleck lipped ravers life the one portrayed here look instead for a charming charismatic man whose compelling speeches inspire the entire nation and whose political work visibly and materially benefits the country i m afraid his personality will be much more like barack obama s than fred phelps i hoped for much here and got nothing but caricature the fools who made this thing perpetrated a crime against reality this is the historical equivalent of reefer madness
avoid the usa version it is with added us footage and the worst dubbing you ve ever heard probably done by new york amateurs the dubbing is so bad that it sounds like mystery science theater i think a black guy from the bronx does chiba s voice i couldn t watch the entire film it was that bad instead of this americanized version watch chiba s other greats like the streetfighter or karate warriors
i have to admit that i m a great fan of this show so you must know how disappointed i got when i watched this movie first of all the plot was awful i thought it was going to be something more interesting like to see what happened to arnold fathers or something more interesting but nooooooo a maniac wants to destroy arnold s house between many other places so many people tries to stop this i must admit that the plot wasn t so bad after all but what really sucked were the steps that arnold and his friends do to stop this maniac they become friends of a spy they drive a bus based on a video game for god sake and to worse everything they make super moves on the bus things that many persons had already tried and died but not arnold gerald and helga cause they are experts on a video game honestly my mom my sister even me got really disappointed after watching this movie cause it was the worst way to finish a really good cartoon i must admit that i used to enjoy hey arnold it was one of my favorite cartoons on nickelodeon but after this crap of movie i m not quite sure if i m going to watch hey arnold as i used to watch it on the past other thing nickelodeon with that enormous number of dynamite i can assure you that not a simple street would explode i think that the whole city could explode with that oh and please if all of your future movies from good cartoons are going to be like that don t do more movies you give a bad critic to cartoons that used to be good honestly i think this was the worst way to end this show a good show transformed into this crap of movie
dear friends and family i guess if one teen wants to become biblical with another teen then that s their eternal damnation just remember kids birth control doesn t mean oral sex i don t care what the honor student says on the other hand even if the senator s aid quotes himself as a bit of a romantic guy he s still only hitting on a high school girl if she was my sister i d eat this guys kneecaps other than that i found out that mongolians don t kiss the same way the french do and that baseball players named zoo like delicate undergarments i think i d almost rather watch richie rich one more time than suffer the indignity of this slip slap slop thank you and good night
wow i remember so many awful films that loosely revolved around high school from the early s they usually had someincredibly strained plot and lots of year old actors pretending to be students as i watched this film i felt a little of the nostalgia of growing up in the s however then i find out that this film was made in say what well the nostalgia factor ends right there this is just bad the plot has the city preparing to close a high school and threatening to bus all of the students to inner city high schools which is odd in that the students at this school are both wealthy and abundant in fact the main character lives in a mansion makes you wonder how they cannot find money to keep this school alive have they never heard of property taxes oh but here is the kicker the school board says that they will keep the school alive if the students can raise so the seniors go about doing this hmmm you raise but instead of saving that for college you put it towards saving the high school that you are a senior in and why exactly would they close an overpopulated school before the year is out and ahh forget it this film was stupid and made in
i wouldn t rent this one even on dollar rental night
bela lugosi plays a doctor who will do anything to keep his wife looking young and beautiful to this end he drugs brides during their wedding ceremonies to make it look as if they are dead so he can steal their bodies i m not exactly sure what he does with the bodies i don t remember it ever being fully explained all i know is that he extracts something from them and injects it in his wife i ll just guess that it s spinal fluid spinal fluid was all the rage of mad scientists in the s you can pretty much guess the rest from here there are a couple well really more than a couple but i ll only write about two of problems that i have with this movie one is the way bela is used sure he does a decent enough job in his own overacting sort of way btw the rest of the cast is simply abysmal but to have him hiding in the back of a hearse or having him creep into the female reporter s bedroom to do nothing is just silly also why have him beat and or kill every henchman he has is it to make him look evil well someone who is kidnapping comatose brides doesn t really need to be made to look more evil the second problem i have is the idea of drugging brides why brides wouldn t any female under the age of do watching bela go through these gyrations to get his victims i was reminded of the idiotic fisherman in i still know what you did last summer in each case there would appear to be an easier way of reaching your objective than employing a seemingly impossible plan that depends way to much on circumstances out of your control btw an alternate title for this movie is the case of the missing brides i guess that partially explains the need for brides
i rented the video of the piano teacher knowing nothing about it other than what was written on the video box i did this with some trepidation because films that win awards at cannes are usually very good or very bad unfortunately this one falls in the latter category about one quarter of the way into it i found myself saying out loud this movie is boring about half way through i was saying to myself where have i seen this before at the three quarters mark i had figured it out in spite of its literary origins this film is essentially a remake of robert altman s much earlier and better that cold day in the park although the details obviously differ and altman s work was more plot driven and less of a character study the two films are thematically identical there is nothing new to be seen in this production every aspect of it has been done before a character spiralling out of control with increasingly self destructive behavior abel ferrara s bad lieutenant a perverse and doomed love culminating in an operatic near death scene david cronenberg s m butterfly uncommonly brutal sex scenes david lynch s blue velvet and so on hence i am bemused by the fact that so many found the film to be shocking shattering etc this highly derivative film seems to have been made for the sole purpose of making viewers feel uncomfortable and clearly succeeded with some however i largely attribute such a reaction to a lack of film viewing experience see enough movies and you really will eventually have seen it all and while it is true that i saw the expurgated r rated version i doubt that the additional scenes would change my overall opinion of the piano teacher technically the film is not without merit there is some very good camera work and the lighting is excellent isabelle huppert s creditable performance also helps save it from being a waste of time this is the first of haneke s films that i ve seen and if i were to see more i expect i would have the same opinion of him that i have of ferrara an interesting director but not nearly the genius others make him out to be rating
black guy becomes rich white guy and rich white guy seems to embrace hip hop culture and most of the funny moments of this film play off of this the problem i have is that it doesn t work and almost never works ok so no one would expect lance to grab a body like that and suddenly start acting like charles wellington that would be too much to ask i ll grant that but at the same time it goes too far the other direction i m supposed to imagine a rich white guy singing rap and completely upending things playing like he s a bastion of hip hop culture and people just accept him and what about sontee who falls in love with him as a rich white guy even though she doesn t care about his money or power this is so completely unbelievable it s not even funny i just couldn t suspend disbelief and i couldn t finish the movie i added one extra star because it did make me laugh even hard a couple of times but i just couldn t get get past the whole white guy doing hip hop thing that has never been well done in any movie i ve ever seen that tries it this was no exception
i joined this site to see what comments people would make about this absolute disaster of a film i wasn t drawn in for even a second the characters were all one dimensional they threw every topic they could think of hoping something would stick i would bet and hope that everyone involved in teachers looks back with embarrassment there are some great actors here but you would never know it thank god it didn t destroy morgan freeman s or judd hirsh s or nick nolte s or laura dern s careers there was no vision no labor of love here only a horrible effort gone wrong btw i don t think the writer ever set foot in a real school
there are some nice shots in this film it catches some of the landscapes with such a beautiful light in fact the cinematography is probably it s best asset but it s basically more of a made for tv movie and although it has a lot of twists and turns in the plot which keeps it quite interesting viewing there are no subtitles and key plot developments are unveiled in spanish so non spanish speakers will be left a little lost i had it as a xmas gift as it s a family trait to work through the films of a actor we find talented and matthew mconaughey was just awesome in a time to kill and the the newton boys so i expressed i wanted to see more of his work however although it says on the dvd box it is a matthew mconaughey film and uses this as a marketing ploy he has a few lines and is on screen for not very minutes at the end of the film he is basically an extra and he doesn t exactly light up the screen while he is on so die hard fans really not worth it from that point of view the films star though patrick mcgaw is great though and very easy on the eye and his character is just so nice and kind and caring a true saint of a guy he d be well written into a rom com so for true mcconaughey acting brilliance of the ones i ve seen i d recommend a time to kill the newton boys frailty how to lose a guy in days edtv and amistad and avoid too larger than life and angels in the outfield unless you feel like a kids film or have kids around as neither of these are indicative of his talent but are quite amusing films for children again mm is really nothing more that a supporting artist with just a few if any lines as for scorpion springit s not a bad film but it also isn t screen stealing either
i do not envy barry levinson rachel weisz ben stiller or jack black for doing this film it s in one word boring maybe the fact that is too predictable the more than exploited ben stiller s loser role or the not at all funny scenes make this film just something to forget even christopher walken s appearance finishes in a pathetic way i was very disappointed i love ben stiller s acting i loved it in most of his films the last one i saw before this was duplex with drew barrymore and was not that bad about jack black well apart from high fidelity i ve never seen him doing something good what about school of rock ooops frightening
this movie was supposed to have depicted a ladie s man bachelor who was ready and willing to settle down once and for all however i did not care for his mission to settle down because i didn t care for his character i don t understand what all of these beautiful women saw in him he had absolutely no class or charisma he should ve at least had a way about himself that made ladies weak in the knees other than his saxophone playing but to no avail just because he is a musician does not make him sexy not to mention the things he did to get the attention of a married woman he fell in love in a span of five minutes of knowing her were absolutely outrageous and ridiculous does this man have any shame what so ever had he tidied up and stopped doing and saying stupid things he would have been more attractive as a character but alas his character was bland and boring gina gershon s character was unnecessarily british she could ve just as easily been an uptight out of towner with her regular speaking voice than do a poor british accent that sometimes would fade through out the movie the only two characters i cared for were the fish and frog now those two had chemistry academy nominations for both stat plot holes lack of character development horrible acting unnecessary drama clich moments what a mess of a movie
while the d animation the highlight of the show did it s job well most other elements fell flat it was as though the filmmakers thought well it s gonna be d so we don t have to work that hard on the plot or character development and the fact that it s a children s movie is absolutely no excuse the public is drawn to three dimensional characters shrek nemo s dad just as much as they are drawn to three dimensional graphics the only dimension any of the main characters showed was two dimensional scooter who twists the plot from time to time with his compulsion to eat everything in sight and the absolute kicker buzz aldrin s appearance at the very end after watching a very robotic cartoon version of the same historical figure for an hour and half comes on the screen and ruins everyone s good time by calling the film s main characters contaminants and announcing that the situation put forth on screen was actually an impossibility did you just wanna tell the kids the easter bunny and santa claus don t exist while you re at it
my girlfriend has the habit of going to blockbuster and choosing movies no one has ever heard anything about admittedly at times it has led to some fun discoveries often times the best that can be said is they definitely run an hour and a half she brought home advice from a caterpillar she was excited because the box said it was funny lucky for us the propaganda on the boxes never lie this movie was an exercise in patience this is one of those movies where unless you are a pretentious and shallow person who likes watching movies about yourself you will hate every character in the movie until the introduction of the one nice character which the lead annoying pretentious character will fall in love with and act in such a way that in the real world would drive anyone away mild spoilers from here onso a bunch of emotionally vapid stuck up pretentious artists swear off love and find success in their careers then they meet a nice intelligent emotionally mature and loving character an almost perfect guy we then watch the woman the annoyingly pretentious artist in her s freak out as she falls in love so she tries to flee from the nice intelligent emotionally mature man and stay with the married man with whom she s been having great but empty sex she is rude to the man and does everything in her power to drive him away in the real world she would have been quite successful i certainly wanted to flee from her and i wasn t even in a relationship with her although its nice that the man fought for his love i never wanted her to have him nor did my girlfriend she didn t deserve him and why i wonder did the director think that the almost perfect guy should be punished by having to win a relationship with her when the artist was asking the almost perfect guy to leave we were screaming for him to leave too there s a problem with a movie when the heroine of the film is so annoying childish and stupid that you want her to fail beyond that let me say that andy dick made me laugh a few times even though his character was also pretentious to the point of annoyance regarding the other characters they were well acted morally bankrupt and annoying characters it is a comedy and i can say i did laugh a few times in the film unfortunately not much laughing happened until the last minutes or so but by the time i had those laughs i had been praying for the movie to end for far too long i needed to get these vapid characters out of my life if you want to watch people you hate struggle with a love for people they don t deserve then this is the movie for you
as is often the case films about self loathing characters do not usually make for good drama downloading nancy is no exception it s supposedly based on a true story about a woman who s murdered at her own request by someone she meets over the internet the protagonist is nancy maria bello who is married to albert rufus sewell albert is a successful software developer who has developed a golf game which his company has successfully marketed to various bars and bar restaurants unlike most human beings albert has virtually no positive attributes except for his ability to be successful in the business world throughout the film albert has a grim and dour expression on his face he has no sympathy for his wife with all her emotional problems and resorts to patronizing prostitutes when his wife asks for sex he punishes her by masturbating in her presence instead nancy is equally one note as a character not only has she had a loveless year marriage but was sexually abused by her uncle when she was growing up thankfully there are no flashbacks of that back story in the film her self loathing takes the form of self mutilation and a result she s forced into therapy however she has such contempt for her therapist that no progress can be made finally nancy is so depressed that she contacts louis over the internet he s sort of a sadomasochistic gigolo who has sex with women for money while inflicting massive amounts of pain to boot it s revealed that louis has two children but no longer sees them the children s mother no longer wants anything to do with him nancy s plan is to first have painful sex with louis and then have him kill her there s a particularly unpleasant scene where louis has sex with nancy while slashing her vaginal area with a broken piece of glass these scenes are shown as flashbacks after louis pays a visit to albert who ties him up and strikes him with a golf club it seems that louis has a two fold plan in going to see albert berate him for his treatment of nancy and enjoy the beating he receives it takes awhile before louis will reveal nancy s fate first he forces albert to do him the favor of taking his dog to a relative so someone will care for it in the future nancy s fate of course is that louis finally ended up choking her to death but showed some hesitation first as he made it clear that he had some feelings for her we soon learn that louis is imprisoned for life for nancy s murder what exactly are we to take away from a film such as downloading nancy are we supposed to feel sorry for victims of sexual abuse and domestic violence is that the main point of the film is sympathy for nancy actually warranted i don t think so the film s writers create a straw man in the character of albert someone who is so cut off from his emotions that he is the one that is held responsible for nancy s decline but are people so one dimensional in real life i think not they have the repulsive louis a man who makes a living by inflicting pain come over and berate albert for neglecting nancy furthermore his expressions of love towards nancy before he kills her is supposed to show his sensitive side in the end it matters little whether the filmmakers have defined where their sympathies lie with the various characters in the film they are so bent on titillating their audience with scenes of gratuitous violence that downloading nancy becomes nothing more than an exercise in poor taste and soft pornography
i ll admit i ve only watched a handful of episodes but each one seemed completely different from the next it seems after the first season the producers decided to completely retool the show drop characters introduce new ones and rewrite the entire show dynamic as you have probably surmised already the show is about quirky unpredictable teenager holly amanda bynes who moves in with her high strung sister valerie jennie garth in new york city decent enough premise odd couple fish out of water high jinx while i miss the sitcoms of yore this show unfortunately misses the mark on funny repeatedly and it s sad because they have some decent talent on top of everything they insisted on changing the show val was living with a cast regular bf one season then he was suddenly gone so she opens a bakery what when things change that drastically you get the feeling that even the show knows it s bad i mean completely new sets characters written off and new show regulars on a side note this is just nitpicking i know this is a television show and not real at all but val and holly end up living in a huge loft duplex there are stairs with a terrace in manhattan are you serious
from the first moment this thing is just an awful sequence of extremely short cuts of blurry camera work while the overall plot has every potential for a thriller the story is so badly told that i m unable to buy it from the middle of the film the actions of characters don t make sense to me stop reading now to avoid spoilers for instance ed s idea to have edna make coffee for them after having shot off her son s arm is way below his alleged experience it s just an extremely stupid idea domino not questioning the fragmentary orders she receives from claremont williams over a breaking up phone connection just eludes me shouldn t she be long suspicious that williams is turning them in those fbi agents seem out of their minds showing up with just one single helicopter to something they have every reason to consider a capital mafia shoot out besides what they do by withholding and leaking information towards cigliutti is pretty much incitement to murder it seems to me like farewell to justice if that s they way the fbi does investigations in reality they d have a case messed up beyond repair if they acted like this we get to see a car accident which normally would have at least seriously injured if not killed most of the passengers but miraculously leaves all of them with just a few bruises quite the contrary the accident is immediately followed by domino making love to choco which is from domino s viewpoint in no way founded by previous events but just by being drugged to the eyeballs the whole sequence of scenes starting from the phone call of claremont williams appears to me just as want to be dramatic razzle dazzle this combined with the awful uneasy camera work just makes a piece i hesitate to call a movie i m sorry for the wasted effort of the main actors whose talent is out of question
oh dear what a disappointment i ve been watching old westerns on british tv for decades and i wasn t aware of this one until its showing yesterday most other scott westerns come around every few years or so and are usually worth watching again the rich colour and outdoor sets were good but that s all i can say about this film i have to agree with most of the other negative comments already made several times i felt like turning it off and finally i did halfway through something i hardly ever do scott seemed unusually oily in charming the girls his two sidekicks were annoying and so was the mexican bandit lad and i ve a feeling the army uniforms were years or so too modern not that this has bothered makers of many other westerns perhaps it got better in the second half but i couldn t be bothered to wait and see
i really wanted to like this but in the end it s a poorly made film with too few laughs the politics are spot on it s gonna offend the hell out of republicans but that s what it s designed to do that alone gives me reason to chuckle the problem is it looks like it was made in a real hurry like about a week and it contains a stupid subplot about some bimbo singer which seems to be completely off topic turiqistan is obviously iraq or afghanistan or any other number of countries the us has f ked with since the s the humour is a little dark amputees dancing with prosthetic legs made by tamerlane corporation but it is on the mark especially with the corporations cashing in on the reconstruction democracy lite however like a lot of satire criticising the us it seems terribly heavy handed and laboured i guess it s running counter to so much bs propaganda so it has to bludgeon people over the head to make a point who knows i prefer more of a nudge wink approach a bit of subtlety but that s just me anyway i might watch it again perhaps i missed something i m hoping w is more on the mark
just a regular jason lee movie there were some parts of the movie that were funny the undertone of the move is to live life on the edge i guess these are the types of movies that i think year old girls watch at slumber parties it was an all right movie it is kind of one of those movies you have on in the back ground and look up every now and then to when something catches attention i think that julia stiles and selma blair are a good combination and would like to see them in a movie with a good story and plot its just kind of a boy meets girl movie this is that perfect movie they would show on comedy central i am glad that i didn t see this movie in the theater i would have been angry but i guess that s why i didn t see it in the theater
in the first howling we are introduced to a world where werewolves exist and are somewhat organized the plot in that film made some sense a tv reporter investigates this and attempts to uncover the truth she ends up having to kill many of them including her boyfriend who becomes one then she shows the world that they do exist by transforming on live tv the special effects were just laughable in the first movie and they don t get any better in this one whether it s the transformations or the bad puppets or the cheesy computer graphics showing the superpowers the plot line isn t all that bad they must kill the leader of the werewolves for some reason this won t destroy all werewolves and it really doesn t end the threat from werewolves as it they just want to kill her i think there was some cloudy reason for this but it really gets lost in the film after the film ends we have a minute montauge of the movie we just watched and every other scene is one where the female werewolf leader rips off her top exposing her large breasts while some devo esquire band plays to a crowd of werewolves the only thing that makes this movie even watchable is christopher lee
i m all for a bad horror movie but this was just a pile of dog sh t how anyone can call this movie cool or decent is beyond me if you like rushed editing to cover the special effects bad acting and a bad script then go for it there was no suspense whatsoever and the gore factor was laughable because it was so fake i ll take hostel or wolf creek over this pile any day my partner gave up after about minutes she knows a stinker when she sees one i on the other hand stupidly sat through the whole movie just to wait and see if it got any better no such luck i haven t sen his other movie torched and i doubt if i ll bother now
i wasn t expecting a lot from a film directed by sidney j furie and starring dolph lundgren but i was surely expecting more than a got a one liner user comment nd rate action movie didn t seem too depreciative to me for a lundgren film on the other hand i wouldn t have bothered to watch this film if its rating was below but hey the movie had a out of score which seemed pretty acceptable to me for this kind of production now i understand that the of people who rated this film a excellent was clearly a publicity stunt because detention is the regular nu image garbage you have seen before over and over lundgren does not convince as an ex military turned a history teacher assigned to a rough school his acting is just plain terrible emotionless and contrived lundgren s inability to act becomes more visible in the scenes with the juvenile delinquent kids either they are great actors or compared to lundgren they seem great actors just because they seem natural and believable detention has some elements that could have been potentially interesting for this low budget movie a closed for weekend high security high school four teens in detention with a war veteran teacher and a group of ruthless criminals trying to get in but the story something like the breakfast club meets die hard or is it panic room is full of unbelievable situations lots of clich s and stereotypical characters and let s not forget dolph lundgren is the main actor alex karzis and kata dob play a bonnie and clyde couple in love and they deliver the most acceptable performances of the movie even if he seems a low budget version of sam rockwell and she a milla jovovich wanna be in a movie where everything fails their craziness and style supplied enough fresh air to prevent my interest from dropping to ground zero
i have watched anime but i m not a die hard fan and i don t read manga i say this because many of the reviewers who are waxing lyrical about this film seem to have that background i have seen st john s wort and although it isn t a masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination it made me pick up shinobi especially since everyone seems to love it well i watched it this afternoon and fought very hard to keep watching yes it s very beautiful the slow motion water scenes the autumn leaves on the trees even the cgi eye flicker majestic i liked the hawk the costumes even some of the fight scenes but overall this was dull as dirt it seemed as if someone took romeo and juliet the translation even mentions that they are star crossed lovers and threw in some x men for good measure two of the characters split wolverine s powers the guy dressed in a bear costume had his claws and the grey haired guy had his ability to heal himself then you have the girl who has a poison kiss that s poison ivy from batman why do they give these women such dumb powers poison girl shows her leg then kisses you to death man that s some great power for you and the other girl can create bugs from this yellow dust that she rubs on her hands the other woman one of the star crossed lovers has the power of a hypnotic stare wow i sort of made it to the end of the film by fast forwarding it and did see a bit more tragedy than i expected some people are comparing this to house of flying daggers and hero don t make that mistake they may share similar endings but that s where the similarities end shinobi is made by an amateur the other films are made by an experienced filmmaker i would say avoid this film unless you re to years old
i have seen dolemite and also avenging disco godfather two other fine works of the blaxploitation canon from our friend rudy ray moore but this film the human tornado aka dolemite will always hold a special place in my heart for sheer goofiness lack of skill in film production and absolute enthusiasm frankly a little too much the human tornado cannot be topped the opening scene sets the tone our old pal dolemite is shacking up with a white woman when some racist local cops raid the house for no good reason and wouldn t you know it the woman in bed with ol dole is none other than the sheriff s wife her cry when she sees him he made me do it dolemite s cry are you for real subtlety was never his strong point highlights the cameo by a very young ernie hudson of ghostbusters fame the continuity errors characters looking one way in one shot and another in the next dolemite s suit changing colors in every single shot of his nightclub act and queen bee s demonic eyes in her first scene but the real joy here is rudy ray moore himself did the man really think he looked cool in this movie i certainly don t know why but you have to admire the sheer enthusiasm he has whether it be jumping totally naked off a cliff or barking orders to his gang in rhyme e g quick into the cave i have a plan to let that mother dig his own grave the man commits totally certainly he goes overboard nevermore so than any time he s doing kung fu the climactic battle is filmed at high speed but occassionaly slows down to let rudy pose and grits his teeth i m not sure if they wanted it too look like they sped up the film as an effect or if they really wanted us to believe he was that fast in any event the matrix it is not human tornado much like the original dolemite is an incompetent film of enormous proportions but at least it s fun and certainly you have to give credit to these people for the effort just not that much enjoy with my hearty recommendations
we actually watched this twice in the theater because we could not believe how bad it was the first time maybe we d missed something nope what s missing was missed from the beginning of preproduction i actually went back to robbin s novel to see if i could find the problem and i discovered that what i thought was funny and exciting back in the day is now just so much disconnected and fuzzy headed junk so the initial problem with the film was deciding to do it at all and the rest of the train wreck progressed from there absolutely nothing works not a blessed thing some beautiful exterior photography gets steamrolled by random camera placement in interior shots all of the actors look at least uncomfortable angie dickenson looks positively mortified except for rain phoenix who gives the impression that she is too unaware to realize how awful her performance really is the dialog is one long unwavering cringe scenes don t make sense from second to second and the connections between them are nonexistent and yet the movie stumbles blindly on convinced that it is saying something profound this is too bad to even be funny it is simply excruciating gus van zant has done other good to great movies which i encourage you to see and i m happy he survived and appears to have learned from this mess
this movie was so bad that my i q went down about points after seeing it it made me wonder who could sit through the weeks it took to make it and think that it was worth it it must of been some kind of personal favor to van damme
revolt of the zombies proves that having the same director revamp and recycle an idea doesn t necessarily make lightning strike twice the halperin brothers responsible for the horror classic white zombie made this trite piece of garbage a mere few years later to cash in on its popularity and even recycled close ups of lugosi s eyes from that previous film there was a court battle with the white zombie film s rights owners who didn t want the halperins to be able to use the word zombie in this title that word was the only thing that could help this film because as everyone knows bad films can make much more money simply by having the word zombie appear in the title knowing what victor halperin was capable of a few years before only makes this uninteresting film more insulting it seems he never directed another horror film after this debacle the zombies here seem not to be true walking dead but simply hypnotism victims wanna create a mind controlled army of zombies be ready to crack a few eggs including your own the lame plot man falls in love with scheming woman who plays with his heart and becomes engaged to him only to make his friend whom she loves jealous this sends man into a spiral of madness in which he tries using zombie mind control techniques to change things to his advantage in an attempt to win over a woman who isn t worth spit this includes one of the most blatantly obvious plot developments i ve ever seen you d have to be blind or stupid not to see the ending coming the acting isn t even good this movie makes the racially insensitive king of the zombies which appeared on the same double bill dvd i bought seems like an atmospheric horror masterpiece by comparison and reminds us that not every black and white film is a classic it makes the atomic age sci fi alien zombie cheese fest invisible invaders seem like a serious drama this is one big ball of cheese so ridiculously melodramatic it could probably make many a korean film fan twitch south korean films are often known for their use of melodrama the credits list the ironically named company favorite films i m not sure whose favorite film this would be but they re obviously an idiot not recommended for fans of zombies romance or classic films
this film differentiates itself from the run of the mill wonder of the human body documentaries by bravely if bizarrely opting to elicit disgust in the viewer in one scene the camera closes in on a gigantic foot zit as a teenager squeezes pus and fluid out of it in another the camera is semisubmerged in a swamp of half digested food and stomach acid as parts of a pasta salad drop in from the esophagus and plop into the goo in a final tour de force the camera takes the viewer on a harrowing ride through a forest of teenage armpit hair unfortunately i m not making any of this up see this film if you must but bring your vomit bag and don t have pasta salad beforehand
ok look at the title of this film the title says it all right the title is great i mean a lot of things should come into your head after readin it in fact you might be extremely anxious to see it well sadly you won t see any of that just a bunch of bad actors some blood spilling some hot chicks and some lesbo action oh well i think there are about minutes of zombies and vampires indeed get away from this if you want to see a good movie else get it
ok for starters taxi driver is amazing this this is not taxi driver or amazing what it is is bad but i thought it was bad funny which means that it did have some redeeming qualities like the dialogue wow there was more or less no plot the characters were all stupid and the movie was preachy there were some places were i thought the movie would dive into taxi driver type violence which would have hit the message at the end of the movie on the head much harder i can t even believe that there are like other people who have seen this movie yeah it s worth watching if you are real bored and you want to reaffirm the fact that anyone can make a movie or at least can try to
recently i saw the documentary the revolution will not be televised also know as ch vez inside the coup at first i thought it showed a genuine inside view of events during the venezuela coup of april what bothered me though was the fact that the tone of the narration and the accompanying music were suggestive and that at no point any criticism was expressed about hugo ch vez this is peculiar because if a documentary is giving an non biased account of what happened there should have been some of that too after all ch vez certainly is not a saint fortunately since the documentary is several years old a lot of additional information is available on the internet nowadays and it was not difficult to find for instance urgent investigation about chavez the coup by the european tv corporations who financed the film which presents blatant falsehoods about venezuela it lists the many errors and intended or unintended falsifications in the documentary just use the title as a search string in google you will find it another interesting document was the video registration of a presentation of the findings of the many errors in this documentary x ray of a lie to me it seems to be a good counterweight to ch vez inside the coup it s available at video google i strongly advice you after watching ch vez inside the coup to look at x ray of a lie and then form your opinion my conclusion is that kim bartley and donnacha o brian were knowingly or not part in ch vez propaganda
there are bad movies then there are the movies that are so bad that they become almost art this is one of those films my partner and i are still both kind of shell shocked you know staring off into space and drooling you can tell that the people involved i hope they changed their names to protect themselves were having a blast and they definitely weren t shy i give this one a three out of ten just because of the gratuitous smut and really bad gore effects i laughed out loud during most of the movie so i guess you could say that it showed me a good time beware viewer the above words in no way construe that this is a good film because it is not all i can say in my defense is that it was impossible to pass up a movie with such a great title
the radar men from the moon is a pretty typical fare of s serials the special effects are pretty cheap the lunar rovers are obviously world war ii surplus jeeps with painted plywood over them and the like the acting is only so so it does inspire the imagination of children to whom i believe this was directed to by today s standards it s boring cheap and bad there s also a hefty amount of stock footage in the first episodes of natural disasters
woody allen has made some of the greatest comedies ever and i would seriously consider saying that annie hall is the greatest movie ever but if i really think about it i will probably think of one or two that are better but it would be hard he has had of course some films that aren t quite good but not that bad either like manhattan murder mystery and sweet and lowdown but he has never before had a film quite as bad as melinda and melinda not quite so tired and so unfunny his films are usually witty and hilarious but how did this happen is it still our good old woody the plot runs around four friends who are having dinner together two are play writers and one of the others mentions a funny story that happened to a friend of hers it is about a young woman who bursts in on a dinner party unexpected we never hear the rest because the two play writes start to debate whether it would make a better comedy or tragedy than we begin to see the two points of view both center on this woman named melinda who is having trouble both with drugs and with her ex husband in the tragedy she is an old family friend who after attempting suicide decided to show up at her old best friends front door for no apparent reason the comedy is about melida who stumbles in on the dinner party after popping sleeping pills both go on a wild whirl wind of events that never really make sense or fit together or make you laugh more than once or twice there are some nice performances by radha mitchell and will ferrell but they can t fit it together on there own they cam t stop it from sinking farther down than most of the other films this year
shortly after seeing this film i questioned the mental competence of every actor and actress that accepted a role elizabeth shue is a commendable actress why would she embrace such an overrated opportunity i must give credit where credit is due though some moments in the movie were unpredictable and rather transfixing but they hardly made up for the scathing perverse tendencies of kevin bacon s character sebastian caine i wouldn t recommend this movie to anyone man or woman that has any form of self respect to account for
gung ho was a good idea however it is to much to ask americans viewers to understand the dynamics of american jobs and foreign competition in this movie the main character hunt stevenson michael keaton goes to japan and convinces a japanese auto company to come to america and help his dying pennslyvania town two things come at you first why would a japanese company come to america to make cars when they do so and so well at that secondly can anyone understand that american companies of all types go to third world nations to have their products made to escape american labor costs it makes the film s premise then that the number one maker of cars in the world would go to one of its top competitors aside from germany and put a plant there as unrealistic keaton was still in his comedy mode by this time but he gives a credible performance all the same as he could prove that he could go from comedy to drama in a matter of seconds and still not embarrass himself but director ron howard can t keep this from becoming a tv movie which it ends up being anyway because they have to give the unlikely story a happy ending the politics and problems of japanese and american relations not withstanding gung ho has a happy days and laverne and shirley feel to it as the producers of both tv shows made the film and then made the tv version of this movie as well which gives the film its lightweight feel the japanese manager gets to love his american workers and feels he and other japanese people can learnfrom americans his no man saito who supposedly doesn t like americans all that much doesn t think so i would have prefered all the japanese characters been like saito than the soft goofball characters they made the japanese out to be it would have made the film more interesting
it s hard to criticize this movie because i dislike the story itself and no amount of good acting would have saved it think raising arizona with a mean streak the acting is passable but jennifer tilly is way over the top yet not enough to make this a nice camp film as usual coming in somewhere between misery and a sarcastic dmv employee the rest of the cast have their brows perpetually knitted in consternation either from the stress of their parts or the stress of the whole futile exercise a real degrading few hours of film darryl hannah spends most of the movie weeping too hard to be understood i wish i could tell you how it ended but i walked out sorry
my first exposure to the templarios not a good one i was excited to find this title among the offerings from anchor bay video which has brought us other cult classics such as spider baby the print quality is excellent but this alone can t hide the fact that the film is deadly dull there s a thrilling opening sequence in which the villagers exact a terrible revenge on the templars set the whole thing in motion but everything else in the movie is slow ponderous ultimately unfulfilling adding insult to injury the movie was dubbed not subtitled as promised on the video jacket
a repressed housewife an annoying lisping angie dickinson whose body double treats horrifies us with an extreme closeup of her delicates is sexually bored by her husband and decides to branch out this directly results in a string of murders that soon involve a high class prostitute nancy allen clearly i am in the wrong business if she can bring home a night and her psychologist michael caine if you are going to watch de palma rip off excuse me pay homage to hitchcock watch sisters instead of this dressed to kill while loaded with style and technical skill is one of the tackiest thrillers i have had the displeasure of sitting through the plot is absurd and tired it does feature some surprisingly effective jump scares and nasty graphic murder sequences that should please any horror fan as long as they can get past the silly story line that must have been dated even in
ah the spirit of the streets of paris were running wild with rebellion the hippies were high on the spirit of love how was britain marking this age of radicalism and revolution erm by the looks of it dear old blighty was focusing on making films about boys in boarding schools if contains the evil establishment it contains the uprising of the oppressed what it lacks in contrast to the parisien passion and the hippy headtripping is any sense of excitement except in its all out ammo and artillery fire ending lindsay anderson s if stars the ever marvellous malcolm mcdowell as one of three private school pupils who decorate their dorm with photos of lenin and other left wing radicals it s clearly an anti establishment movie in its depiction of the evil upper class oiks who rule the roost and the antiquated autocratic practices of the pish posh public school standard what makes if unusual though is that for all its radical sympathies it doesn t explicitly give us any sense of great tension between human decency and the despotic school system instead it just kind of floats lacking in plot and lacking in personality surrealist bits fade in and out occasionally and the film slips from black and white to colour again is it due to the low budget or is it an arty expression but there is little of interest to speak of all we get is the poignant denouement where the young rebels reach for their rifles and shoot down the shady overlords of the establishment hooray a revolution at last something that demands a second thought unlike the rest of this dull exercise in boarding school daydreaming if could have been a powerful political statement but as it is it drifts and only gathers any sense of direct interest at the end instead of being a testament to the dissident zeitgeist of the late sixties it only succeeds in being a dazed document of upper class british education anarchy apathy more like the only man many viewers will want to stick it to after watching if will be lindsay anderson
after viewing the film i was truly shocked to see such a high rating on imdb the fantastic mr fox is an adaption of a beloved children s classic portraying the story of the smooth slick protagonist mr fox or foxy as he attempts one last heist to steal from the dreaded boggins bunce and bean that s right one short one fat one lean or however it goes i don t quite know where to start with my criticism well i m in my late teens and was never a fan of roald dahl but i like his material well enough having read a few of his books as a child and seen matilda and charlie and the chocolate factory over and over again this film however struggles for an audience is it aimed at children adults i m still unsure many of the jokes would bore a child especially as mr fox visits a lawyer for example or complains about being poor also an audience of i m assuming children is expected to sympathise with a character who steals and kills chickens i m all for the food chain but you practically see mr fox biting down on their necks surely that s a bit much and also the plot well it s kind of boring i stayed only with the hope of it getting better but instead i just got more and more annoyed at mr fox and his son ash for making stupid decisions the humour meanwhile falls flat i laughed only once or twice even though i specifically recognised attempts at jokes i think part of it is that the voice acting is so incredibly flat and monotoned the voice actors have no sense of comic timing instead aiming for the subtlety of humour that only works with certain mediums george clooney aims to portray mr fox as charming and sleek but his voice has no character meryl streep shows no emotion i didn t even realise bill murray had a role until the end credits and ash twelve years old in fox years sounds like he s about i love animation particularly stop motion but the visual style actually creeped me out a little bit characters are tall spindly and lacking any warmth of design they move with very little fluidity and often the animation is jerky and strange there is also a distinctive mixed medium feel as d components are added in sporadically and unsuccessfully characters look straight at the camera and talked it was very awkward there was one or two moments when kylie looked straight at the camera didn t move and had swirls on his eyeballs it actually freaked me out fantastic mr fox had so much potential lots of people still seem to like it look at the reviews maybe it just wasn t for me
surprisingly enough does movie does have some redeeming quality in it when it moves toward its end for the other part this movie is being a really bad and lame one with a small budget insultingly bad written script and everything that goes with it it s silly that with all the money going around in the christian circles they never can seem to get sufficient funds to make a decent movie with i m not a religious so i couldn t care less really but film making does some like a good tool to reach a new audience for churches and getting people more interested and curious in reading the bible for instance in that regard these movies always seem like a wasted opportunity the low budget does really hurt the movie and brings it down it makes the movie laughable to watch with its effects and it just gives the overall movie a campy b movie like feeling but what s hurting this movie more is its writing the stuff that just happens in this movie is just insulting to the intelligence and then i m not even complaining or talking about the religious aspects of the whole story the way the movie progresses is just so improbable and the people within this movie do such highly unlikely things that it s being insulting to its viewers i also hated how the movie was being like a soap opera at times seemed to me that they simply had a hard time turning this into a full length movie and they added in some characters and dramatic developments just to fill things up i just couldn t cared less really at times still it needs to be said that the movie gets more solid and steady toward its end when its story gets more focused on its essence still it remains predictable all but it prevented this movie from being a complete wreck to watch and as far as these type of movies are concerned there are far worser one to watch out there though i don t think this movie will win over any new souls
dahmer a young confused man dahmer a confusing movie granted i had a few beers while watching the movie but that doesn t explain why i got so bored by this flick its flashbacks are nothing but confusing and annoying and there s no real storyline with a beginning and an end the only thing that made sense in the movie was the explaining text in the beginning and at the very end of the movie the inbetween stuff which would be the movie is just boring images and a waste of time we never see actual murders everything is just a bunch of insinuations sometimes you even just get a feeling that dahmer s dreaming the entire thing but you know he isn t since it sbased on a true story and this actually happened at least most of it but what happened it s not easy to tell i do not encourage people to waste time on this movie ididn t like it one bit and i felt cheated when it suddenly ended
i created my own reality by walking out of the theater i was roped in by my girlfriend into going to this dreck with her mom we my g friend and i walked out about an hour into it what a load of pseudo scientific new age jargon sub atomic particles are thoughts by taping labels to bottles of water and blessing it by a buddhist monk it grew little pretty crystals a drop of in the murder rate in dc happened when a bunch of folks meditated wow what a rigorous scientific study i m sure that someone ate cheerios for four days straight during the same time should we conclude that eating cheerios caused a drop in the murder rate hogwash hooey bull pucky btw it was funded by the ramtha cult the leader of which was one of the experts which were interview by the filmmakers no ulterior motives here right
i have read the other comment about this movie and usually i try not to be harsh in my criticisms because i try to be a nice person however this movie is one of the worst movies that i have ever seen and thats topping a lot of bad usa network plus cinemax nights whoever thought of this movie needs to be prevented from ever making another one this film disgusted me in a way that no other film ever i really think these people are insane just save your time and do not watch this fllm please i wish that i had the acting is horrible the plot what plot is stupid and degrading and insane i really do not think this should have been made into a movie but that is my opinion and i am trying to save you from wasting your time
notice i have given this star if the option been given i would have given this zero as i put this dvd into my tv and sat down on my couch i was expecting some of the worst film making at its finest i looked this movie up on imdb and saw that it was the worst rated movie so i guess i came into it critical of every mistake but it didn t prepare me for the crap that was about to spew from my television screen the box makes this movie out to look well ok at best do not let that fool you this movie needs to be banned from all shelves around the world the best way i can describe this movie is like porn but without any sex scenes in it the acting if you can call it that the plot so many holes must look like swiss cheese and the special effects really are just terrible please do not be like me and rent this movie because you think it will be funny to watch in the end i m not saying i can make a better movie than this but i am thinking it
roman polanski has made many many movies that are unexceptional his fame bewilders me nothing stands out as a high point except chinatown i haven t seen knife in the water or tess any contribution he s made to film concluded more than twenty years ago his work is just embarrassing safe and or dull the pianist frantic oliver twist the ninth gate pirates r s baby must have signified the end of the establishment at the time it came out it s lux produced and fairly high concept for a horror movie never show the baby but this is just misconceived horror sap everything is arty to the point that the plot line becomes hopelessly clear very early um thanks for that finale destroying title and on a clear day you can see the twist ending coming for days it did not sustain my interest i find that whatever this movie might have been it is utterly derailed by the s version of what femininity was farrow is such a chronic distracted helpless waif housewife her frailty is oversold she s irritating in the extreme there s no real ideas in it nothing to consider except being the mother of the devil the dakota is barely exploited for it eerie potential
koen wouters is a flemish singer and presenter in the early ninety s he tried his hand on movies as well but this unbelievable piece of junk ended his acting career once and for all it also ended the acting career of dutch actress nada van nie who went on being a football wife a tv presenter and program maker i actually did see this in an almost empty theatre because i used to be a fan of the band of koen wouters clouseau i so regret spending money on it it looks cheap it is a terrible story and it is executed bad in every possible way some people think it s so bad it s funny i am not one of them i just found it an incredible waste of time and money

this is just a terrible comedy it really is a bad film there are no funny elements no jokes that are funny i don t know how some people can claim this dismal short film could be smartest or quality perhaps if its the only film that a person has seen you can make that claim of the brothers but i have seen thousands of better films namely leonard part six now that s funny i don t know how the brothers is even considered eligible to be listed on the internet movie database its more like a home video than an actual film jokes aside just skip this film a root canal is more enjoyable that this cliche ridden unfunny material
this film seems to be completely pointless there is no reason why anything that happens in it happens as if it was written by a small child who got bored halfway through and thought how can i wrap this up and what were jared harris and christopher walken thinking did they do it for a bet i couldn t tell you the plot i m not entirely sure there is one to be quite frank but if there is it didn t register jared and his bird go to ireland after she falls down the stairs while lashed up as you do they go to a house with a very annoying small girl in it meet christopher walken who has dug up some ancient woman preserved in peat he brings her back to life for no other reason than it continues the story and she shows her gratitude by immediately icing him from then on it all gets a bit silly a couple of hours of my life that i d like back

to say that thunderbirds is a horrid forced in your face ugly looking nasty to listen to and painful to watch film wouldn t be saying enough there are only two reasons i can think of why you d watch this film you ve seen thunderbirds when you were young like i did and are curious as to what it is like but you will really only be watching to find out how badly they screwed things up or you re seeing it with someone under ten years old thunderbirds manages to cock up everything it attempts the list goes on and on but there are other more subtle humiliating things that are painfully obvious when you think about it from the off thunderbirds is wrong wrong wrong the whole moral message and goal is set up in an excruciating way jeff tracy a new low for bill paxton tells his youngest son alan he s not yet proved himself to be a thunderbird after alan randomly and stupidly decided to go down into tracy island s bowels to fire up thunderbird one the whole film is then a series of events and miss fires consisting of alan trying to prove himself whilst his father and other brothers are trapped in space aboard thunderbird five the film relies on kid actors to carry the film a year old alan tracy corbet a year old tin tin hudgens and a year old fermat fulton who is brains son to say that watching the adventures they get up to is painful is an understatement frequently trying to act and utilise the script whilst combating the evil hood kingsley in ridiculously unfunny and hammy ways acts as the entertainment for the duration of the film it only differs when everyone s in a different location also the whole mind control thing was very tiresome and basically dragged the film down as it was overused and offered a way for our heroes to see a weakness in the hood forced and incidental i know that most film s for kids these days try to integrate some sort of material for adults but in thunderbirds it s done in a way that fetishises lady penelope sophia myles plays penelope and i think it s no coincidence she s a little older than the rest of the kids at years old it s almost too good to be true her scenes are often highly charged and carry an erotic push we see her in the bath bubbles up to her neck watching tv in comes her butler and sneaks a peek as she seductively changes channels with her wet bare and bubble covered foot frequent shots of her massive bright pink high heeled shoes filling the screen during various scenes this first happens when she is actually tied up with the second happening during a fist fight with another woman twinned with this her bright pink costumes that reveal just enough yet cover just enough are particularly outstanding as is the way she moves and talks with that posh dominant english accent sounding like a commanding mistress well she is lady penelope after all and you d better make sure call her that the whole thing is laughable but the editing is so quick that the kids won t notice but it sure as hell is there the actual plot of the hood doing all that he does just to rob a few banks is very bizarre the characters that are his bodyguards a geeky looking woman and hard bodied black man who gets agitated a lot are we supposed to be laughing at this what about the fight scenes poorly choreographed stunts and what the hell was with the silly noises it s utterly utterly laughable the list goes on the way bill paxton plays it all so seriously like he was told they were doing it one way but it was made another the way ford motor company have their logo slapped all over the place news bulletin sponsored by ford the camera even moves to endorse ford several times when cars are in shot the way the cgi looks like something out of a computer game video clip it s infuriating the fact we are told to believe that a year old girl can swim in the freezing thames against the current rescue a downed monorail monorail over the thames get back to the hatch and thus save the day all the time holding her breath it is absolute bull and the makers know it i don t even know if a year old would swallow it in short avoid avoid avoid thunderbirds is infuriating unfunny poorly scripted and even the rolls royce was taken out and replaced by a flying car everything that could go wrong did go wrong
like many others have commented before me here i have to say that this movie is bad but not the worst i ve seen there will be no direct references to movie plots or sequences in this comment because i hate spoilers i got a feeling i was watching an episode of a tv show or something where they had gotten a hold of some extra to spend on cgi i ve seen worse of those all in all it is quite an insult to the viewer at least if you have any knowledge about computers and or technology at all there are just too many of these moments of insults to make me feel comfortable and i found myself just begging for it all to end fast halfway through in addition there are countless easy way out scenarios which also is an insult to your intelligence as a thinking human being this movie absolutely fades in comparison to the old wargames and i think it s a damn shame they even got to call it a sequel two stars from me because of one thing and one thing only the actors performances aren t half bad considering the regurgitated crap of a script they had to work with still they should never have signed on to this movie not really a career move but i guess we all have bills to pay to those of you who gave this movie top score you have to be on the studio s payroll or something that s my only explanation to all who haven t seen this one by all means watch it and make up your own mind but lower your expectations to the floor and then some
after watching the first mn of blanche sorry i couldn t take more of it i have now confirmed she does not basically this movie is an insult to the real french actors participating in this farcical piece of junk it starts from a concept successfully used in french comedies deux heures moins le quart avant jesus christ la folie des grandeurs a historical movie with anachronic tone dialogues this can give brilliant results if supported by brilliant actors and a finesse of direction avoiding the dreaded heavy comedy stigma unfortunately the horsey faced lou doillon ruins everything and blanche instead of a comedy just turns into an horror movie horror to cinephiles who want to be puzzled and shocked watching fine actors such as decaune zem or rochefort struggling in the middle of this gaudy burlesque kitchy prissy farce
the intention the directors has for this films are quite honorable but his history of his productions did get me aware that this might not get much to the core like other film makers would do it keeping his great days tv series in mind but also counting in his mtv production i bet you will that opposes his seriousness in any of the matters he documents and also counting in his rather disappointing production supersize me i did not had my hopes up high sadly enough this movie disappointed me none the less as with supersize me after a while i did ask myself what exactly the point of all this was the main statement gets clear enough after half an hour but the rest of the playtime gets filled with rather pointless stuff and re repeating stuff that were already shown in this way or another earlier in the movie so it wears out and gets extremely boring towards the end
near the beginning of the godfather part iii michael corleone s son wants to drop out of law school and become a musician michael corleone does not want this but his estranged ex wife kay manages to convince him to let anthony corleone pursue music as he wishes so he does that seems like an odd way to start a review as it is a minor plot point and has nothing really to do with the major action just bear with me here you ll see where i m going with this eventually now let me tell you about the major plot it is about michael corleone wanting to quit crime for good he has largely abandoned all criminal elements in his family business but then along comes vincent mancini an illegitimate nephew who is involved in a feud so of course michael must endure yet another brush with criminality and gun violence and all that good gangster stuff meanwhile vincent has a semi incestuous affair with michael s daughter mary oh and michael and kay are trying to patch up all the horrid things that happened at the end of part ii it is like a soap opera one horrid awful minute soap opera gone is any sort of the sophistication romance and emotional relevance that made the first two movies hit home so hard after a year break in the franchise francis ford coppola delivered a mess of sop and pretentiousness entirely incongruous with the first two films once again proving his last great work was apocalypse now back in the s what s worse the godfather part iii isn t even a logical follow up of the godfather part ii michael is a completely different person he hasn t just gone to seed which might be legitimate even if it d be no fun to watch he s become a goody goody that s trying to fix all the tragedy that made part ii such a devastating masterpiece his confession to the priest was bad enough but that little diabetes attack in the middle pushed it over to nauseating he also gets back together with kay for heaven s sakes there is absolutely no way that should happen as the nd movie made abundantly clear she aborted his baby and his sicilian upbringing made him despise her for it didn t francis ford coppola even think of these things and don t even get me started on mary and vincent s affair for a romance so forbidden it was shockingly unengaging sofia coppola s acting did nothing to help she made the smartest move of her life when she switched from in front of the camera to behind it because she was possibly the worst actress i have ever seen in a best picture nominee every line she delivered was painfully memorized and every time the drama rested on her acting abilities all she elicited was inappropriate giggles in the climactic scene i won t go into detail but you ll know which scene i m talking about when if you watch it she looks at michael and says daddy i think i was meant to cry but the line was delivered so poorly i burst out into long loud laughter now we get to the climax and now you will also realize why i took time to start the review with a description of anthony corleone s musical ambitions after minutes of petty drama and irrelevant happenstances anthony corleone returns with an opera so michael kay mary and vincent go to see it and for about minutes a couple killers walk around trying to assassinate michael about this climactic sequence i must say one thing it was really good but not because of the killers they were pretty boring i just really liked the opera it had some great music and real great set pieces and from what little it showed us it seemed that the story had echoes of the corleone family s origin i ll bet it was one swell opera and i ll bet michael corleone was glad he let his son switch from law school to music my biggest wish is this that francis ford coppola had merely filmed anthony corleone s opera for minutes and ditched the rest of the soggy melodrama better yet i wish he hadn t made the godfather part iii at all part ii gave us the perfect ending this spin off was self indulgent and unnecessary p s this is not a gut reaction to the film i watched all godfather films over a month ago though i was rewatching the first one not only does this mean that my expectations for part iii weren t screwed in fact i had set the bar rather low for it after what i heard but it also means i ve had a good time to think about all three films while i was a bit disappointed with part ii at first the more i thought about it the better it seemed but with part iii it was bad to begin with then got worse the more i thought about it the sad thing is that many people will stop with part i but if they watch part ii as well they will most likely go on to part iii if you have the will watch parts i ii and pretend like part iii never existed
this movie is a loose collection of unintelligible analogies and ill conceived plot devices movie history the director of this film was a pervert who drove around town filming random women when his wife discovered the film reels he was forced to quickly contrive a story he claimed he was making a movie called the brain that wouldn t die eventually his wife demanded that he show her his so called movie that night he quickly filmed some extra scenes with a friend and the brain that wouldn t die was born i hate this movie plot synopsis the main character s fianc is killed in a horrible car accident that he caused by ignoring the clearly posted road signs he grabs her head from the wreckage and reanimates it after reanimating the head he goes and picks up a bunch of hookers that is pretty much what happens for the rest of the movie at the end he fights and is killed by a monster that lives in the closet the monster appears with little to no explanation however the monster saves a hooker and i assume that they live happily ever after side notes the end credit screen claims that the movie is called the head that wouldn t die i hate this movie
i blind bought this movie and am pretty upset that i paid as much as i did but i would say that it s at least worth a rent for some cool deaths and laughable acting it is not a good movie in any way but i must say that i was pretty darn entertained i guess it could be called so bad it s good as i said the acting is awful i feel like i could have done a better job showing at least any emotion the story is nothing new and has been done better i guess i just have a soft spot for any carnival esquire type film i would say rent this or download it but definitely don t buy it it is not worth more than one watch
sugar spice is one of the worst movies of the film tries to cross heathers and bring it on and fails when i saw last january i was so disgusted by the film that i walked and talked on my cell phone to my girlfriend for the last half hour of the movie i ve heard that the dvd has a director s cut maybe i ll check it out but this pg trash movie is s and the worst kind of s maybe if the film had some t a that would ve have made it okay but the gags are lame and the acting is horrible worse than a troma film
a very ordinary made for tv product tyson attempts to be a serious biopic while stretching the moments of angst for effect fast forwarding through the esoterics of the corrupt sport of boxing and muddling the sensationalistic stuff which is the only thing which makes tyson even remotely interesting a lukewarm watch at best which more likely to appeal to the general public than to boxing fans
because of the writers guild of america strike they had to shoot this episode in days it s pretty much crap consisting of repeat cut pasted clips from season and was described by its writer maurice hurley as terrible just terrible why the producers couldn t just wait to shoot something decent who knows i m guessing because of the strike the production ran out of money and could only release a flashback episode or maybe roddenberry was too sick at the time to be able to veto this half assery this episode also marks the final appearance of diana muldaur dr katherine pulaski on the series
it s hard to believe an action packed jet li movie could be so boring but this was transcendant trash the plot is an amalgam of other hong kong chopsocky flicks the martial arts action is all special effects and no human talent it s a comic book story about a group of super human soldiers who are to be killed because they re mentally unstable one of their number li who holds off an incompetent army to save them and rebuilds a life as a pacifist librarian the saved killers resurface with an austin powers quality plot to take over the world and li sheds his new life to save the world the version i saw was dubbed and that may have accentuated the cheesiness of the wafer thin plot and comic book cent special effects but i suspect even ninja turtle watching year olds would have found this juvenile and hollow
corky romano has to be one of the most jaw dropping and horrific comedy s ever made while the sometimes amusing chris kattan who pulled off a very funny performance in the hilarious undercover brother his character in corky is so stupid and so unfunny which is a shame since the premise is a wonderful idea to bad they ran out of them when they got to page on the script
writer director tony piccirillo adapted his own play about a straight man recently widowed learning in the last three weeks he is hiv positive he tracks down the one homosexual partner he ever had brings him to an apartment and ties him up forcing a blood test on the guy and promising bloody revenge if the results come back positive intriguing idea sounds better on paper than it plays out james marsden s captive is realistically cynical and snotty but the actor s own artificial mannerisms are disconcerting it s like watching a roadshow version of tom cruise scott speedman has to work harder with the more challenging role but his personality turn from shy guy to kidnapper on the edge isn t convincing and neither are the conversations the two men have marsden s gay party boy isn t apathetic of course he s momentarily sympathetic to speedman s plight but he doesn t react or behave the way any homosexual man would in this circumstance the movie isn t a cop out exactly but it is a fraud handicapped further by the bad editing the poorly conceived flashbacks the low budget production and the big finale which smacks of silly pretension and soapy melodrama from
i went into a video store and looked around to find some horror movies after about minutes i just rushed and picked out a few i stumbled upon masters of horror which contained pro life and right to die they seemed ok same old cheesy horror crap but i was interested for some reason it said about pro life on the case about being a classic a return to form for john carpenter i loved his the thing so i thought this would be good and all that so i turned it on thinking it would be something great and interesting i was very wrong it started off casual just a girl running through a forest scared of something a car stops and picks her up just so being the people she needed to see amazing they take her back to some clinic and examine her at the sametime all this is happening her father appears at the gates and they don t allow him in he isn t aloud near the area most likely from something he would of done in the past but you don t know of any of this at the moment he really does not want his daughter in this place an abortion center he is very strongly against such acts believing it s sickening and not what god would want he supports what i heard is called pro life acting against abortions and going to extremes to allow the babies to be born they are sick they don t like the life of an unborn being taken yet they ve killed humans in the past to allow the birth justice is only a figment of the mind anyway back on track after the girl is examined they find out shes pregnant but far ahead than what she should be she is only a few weeks pregnant but is months ahead she keeps telling them they wont understand her and that she wants an abortion and all but finally tells the truth that she was raped by a demon from hell and that her father wants this baby but believes god wants this baby not who truly does he gets his sons they arm themselves with pistols and shotguns and begin to make they re way into the clinic shooting down anyone who won t co operate the head of the clinic who must of had trouble with them in the past is well prepared this time ends up killing one the fathers sons but in the end gets shot a few times wearing a bullet proof jacket the father then performs what he believes is done to the women he cuts a hole where the vagina would be if he we re a female and sticks some sort of sucking thing up there and sucks out all this blood whilst all this is happening the girl gives birth to some demonic baby with many legs and some demon raises from beneath the earth not in the same room and starts looking for its child the father sees this later on and starts questioning why this happened he did what he was told to do and doesn t understand why it s like this the demon had killed both of his sons earlier and now goes for father whilst the girl kills the baby and the demon carries it away not in the same scene yeah it probably sounds pretty cool and a thrilling horror movie but it isn t the acting is horrible and lacks enthusiasm the script is boring and not even creative they choose the wrong characters and don t even build on them just everything put together all the small parts don t even add up to something great a waste of time i wouldn t classify this as a horror though it has elements of horror they ultimately fail at what they try to succeed it felt more like a beginners short movie than by john carpenter sorry for my lack of information and detailed review i just didn t have the time to waste to write something exciting also sorry if my spelling and details are incorrect i couldn t really be bothered to research anything
this movie started out good i felt like i was watching an adult version of seinfeld much to quickly i started questioning the situations and actions of the main characters and found no answers to why they were doing what they were doing all the acting was superb but only a few scenes had brief moments where they were actually funny dan cortese was amazing i loved him in this role his agent should show this movie to casting agents watch the first few scenes and then find something better or else you will find yourself totally lost in this mess i found this in a bin at a video store it cost me two dollars and due to the rareness of this movie i feel like it was a good price
meatball machine has got to be one of the most complex ridiculous awful and over exaggerated sci fi horror films that i have ever came across it is about good against evil and a coming of age tale with the aim of to entertain with bloody sleazy and humorous context because of that the violence isn t particularly gruesome and it doesn t make you squirm but the gratuitous bloodletting and nudity does run freely the performances by issei takahashi and toru tezuka is the worst i have seen if that was not enough it is also directed by an unheard of director called yudai yamaguchi this movie just have it all it is bad to the bone a must see for every b movie freak simply an enjoying and rare gem
this abc straight to tv failure does absolutely no justice to the brilliant fantasy novel that is a wrinkle in time ms madeleine l engle brought children and adults alike into a magical fantastical and original world like no author before her this novel the first in her time quartet is a beautiful take on life the universe and time itself yet it is easy for any child or adolescent to understand its unwavering morals are prevalent throughout the book this film adaptation can be seen as nothing but a mockery of ms l engle s work of art honestly what were they thinking the effects look cheap and ridiculous the plot is mushy and uneven the dialogue is far fetched and just about every magical characteristic of the novel has been lost this was a horrible attempt at bringing this book to the screen i sincerely hope that someday an intelligent worthy director guillermo del toro david yates alfonso cuar n makes another attempt at bringing this book to the screen and understands it for what it truly is a masterpiece this adaptation can only be compared to boring fake and cheap motel room art which holds no ground and makes absolutely no impact on its audience
contains spoilers the truly exquisite sean young who in some scenes with her hair poofed up looks something like elizabeth taylor is striking in her opening moments in this film sitting in the back of a police car waiting to signal a bust her face and body are tense and distracted unfortunately once the bust is over young s strained demeanor never changes this is one fatally inhibited actress one has only to compare young to the performer playing her coworker and best friend arnetia walker to grasp what is missing in young walker is open emotional and at ease at all times in that there s no apparent barrier between what she may be feeling and her expression of it she is an open book young on the other hand acts in the skittish self conscious way you might expect your neighbor to act were they suddenly thrown into starring in a film basically she doesn t have a clue with this major void looming at the center of the movie we re left to ponder the implausiblities of the story for instance after miss young is kidnapped by the criminal she s trailing and locked in a closet she breaks the door down when left alone granted she s dressed only in a bra and panties but in a similar situation with a psycho captor due to return any moment would you head for the door or take the time to go through his dresser take out some clothes and get dressed i would guess that this and other scenes are trying to suggest some sort of mixed emotions miss young s character is experiencing but young can not convey this type of complexity there are a few affecting moments in the film such as the short police interviews with the criminal s past victims but overall this is an aimless endeavor it s too bad miss young was replaced while filming the pair of comic book style films that might have exploited her limitations with some humor batman and dick tracy because her floundering while attempting to play actual people is oddly touching watching miss young try to act at least in this thriller is a sad spectacle
i usually enjoy films like this it s shot documentary style but the acting and writing are just awful the acting is wooden and stiff and the writing is just so clich but not at all in a good way as of typing this i m surprised it s at a on imdb i m certain that most of these votes must have come from relatives of people in the movie i suppose if that s the case you might manage a couple of laughs as it s always funny seeing your relatives friends make a movie well in a way i guess this gives hope to all up and coming writers directors actors etc cause if they can do it you can do it although maybe you shouldn t
wow that s about as much as i can say right now who writes this stuff who produces this stuff what self respecting actor would agree to act in this stuff oh my god i don t know how i made it through this movie but i assume the fact that i had had like cups of coffee that day was the key element in keeping me awake good lord it was one of the most droned out and predictable pieces of cinematography i have ever witnessed and for the record i don t ever plan to witness it again i first saw the film when i bought the dvd mistake i mean i figured hey julia stiles i like her she s cool i ll watch it as soon as i get home mistake i tried to watch it without groaning every five minutes wondering when this bunch of crap would come to an end really i did but i was unsuccessful it was one of the worst things i had ever seen i mean what is with that thing where he imagines what would happen then snaps back into real life that was annoying enough when the father used to do that in parenthood like ten years ago the jokes and believe me it takes a lot out of me to call them that are stupid the characters are trite and forgettable the storyline is entirely predictable altogether this makes for a movie that should be wiped from history records i should have figured something was wrong when i realized that i d never heard of this movie it was most likely a straight to dvd to anybody who may be thinking of watching this i have one piece of advice don t for the love of god don t i m ashamed to have it in my dvd collection and i can t get rid of it nobody and i mean nobody wants to buy it from me and i m talking second hand and third hand thrift shops that would buy the mud off your shoes and stick it in the store window that should let you know just how crap it is
envy stars some of the best jack black ben stiller amy poehler and the great christopher walken with such a cast one can only expect the best however with envy no one could save this disaster tim dingman stiller and nick vanderpark black are best friends and co workers at a sandpaper factory both are making a decent living but because tim has a better performance at work he s able to afford more than his buddy nick nick is a dreamer who s always coming up with new ideas for inventions one day nick comes up with the idea for a spray can that makes dog poop disappear yes i m serious falling in love with the idea nick decides to really invent this product he makes an offer to tim to invest in his idea and share the profits tim refuses thinking the idea will never work nick s invention titled va poo rize again i m serious ends up making millions he enjoys spending his money on things like a much larger house a horse a personal trainer and fancy deserts tim starts feeling envy for nick hence the name of the movie the concept isn t bad but it still turns out awful this movie contains some of the worst dialog and very poor performances from all the cast then again as i mentioned earlier none of them could save this mess not even the great christoper walken playing a homeless character named j man made this movie funny the movie is bad from the start and only continues to get worse i recommend this movie if you like crap no pun intended you want to see jack black in a white tuxi say avoid this movie at all costs but avoid especially if you re offended by bathroom humor you love animals
aside for being classic in the aspect of its cheesy lines and terrible acting this film should never be watched unless you are looking for a good cure for your insomnia i can t imagine anyone actually thinking this was a good movie
stars for kay francis she s wonderful and she didn t deserve this horrible tripe that warner bros threw her way the two pronged premise that this movie is based on is ridiculous and unbelievable in the extreme kay is a small town wife and mother who yearns for something bigger she wants to be an actress when a big shot actor comes to town and invites kay to his hotel to talk about possibilities kay tells her husband she s going to the movies the hubby s biddy of a mother puts a bug in hubby s ear that kay s not being truthful and he sets out looking for her he finds her w the actor in the hotel they are only talking and he slugs the guy who falls over a railing lands face first in a pond lake and dies now here s the two unbelievable premises upon which the rest of the movie is based the judge tells the jury that if it s determined that the man died before his head went into the water that they must find the hubby guilty of first degree murder whaaaaa i think slugging a guy in a fit of rage would count for manslaughter or murder at the most not first degree murder give me a break but the plot required him being found guilty of murder so that he could be sent to prison for life whatever the hubby s lawyer after the conviction and sentencing tells kay that it s all her fault his reasoning is that if she hadn t gone over to the actor s room then her husband wouldn t have had to go after her and slug the guy and kill him he tells her that she s the guilty one not her husband and she nods and agrees what the hell the rest of the movie is all about kay trying to achieve fame and money in order to get her husband released from prison and right the wrong she committed by causing him to kill the actor dude in the first place i can t even go on with this review the movie was just all too painful four years earlier in the pre code days you d never have caught kay playing such a wimp in true kay francis fashion though she did do her best to make us believe that this woman was a believable character i give her much credit for trying to breathe some life and credibility to this thankless role this character was a far cry from pre code kay roles and real life spitfire kay francis steer way clear of this one there are much better kay francis vehicles out there from personal experience i can highly recommend mary stevens md and jewel robbery also good are dr monica and one way passage i m sure there s other great kay flicks as well but i m only mentioning the ones i ve seen and can recommend
bo is jane parker whose long lost anthropologist father richard harris in the worst role of a very inconsistent career is in africa studying something or another she tracks him down how and he tells her of the natives stories of a giant monster whose nightly howling can be heard throughout the jungle turns out to be the ape man himself miles o keeffe who has the film s best dialogue who rescues her from bad guys and falls in love with her leaving them just enough time in this agonizing two hours to romp naked while a horny monkey looks on and cheers normally i m very open minded to varying opinions about any film but this is the sole exception this is the worst film ever made if you don t agree you haven t seen it notes newsday called it unendurable which is the best one word summary i can think of the maltin movie guide comments that they almost had to think of a rating lower than bomb
this movie is once again one of those movies that someone thinks or tries to make others think that they understood it anyone who tries to make any sense of this is a moron my advise would be to take two not one but two hits of very strong acid and at least you ll get a visual thrill out of it although at the end you may kill yourself for wasting your acid being that this comment requires lines of info let me write something for those of you that will try to defend the movie unintelligble garbage schitzoid waste of talent movie is ice with paper on destination with ringing clouds on a sunny dive in the pudding sounds like lion in a red light with seeing hair now explain that to me
oh dear some of the best talent in british tv made this serial and so i can only assume that they were working under incredible time pressure and had to settle for first takes of many scenes there are some frightening scenes in this highland mystery mostly when the monster attacks and we see it from his point of view but i m afraid that i found most of the story unintentionally funny such as the moment when the hero discovers a dismembered corpse on a golf course oh look there s a hand oh and there s another hand over there hmm this is a bit puzzling for many years fans of british cult tv shows campaigned to have this serial released on vhs or dvd but the bbc always said no now i think i understand why
don t bother a little prosciutto could go a long way but all we get is pure ham particularly from dunaway the plot is one of those bumper car episodes the vehicle bounces into another and everything changes direction again until we are merely scratching our heads wondering if there were ever a plot gina phillips is actually good but it s hard playing across from a mystified dunaway playing lady macbeth lost in the marx s brother s duck soup ah the raven now there s an actor and there is the relative who just lies and bed and looks ghostly or dr dread who s filled with lots of gloom and no working remedies i m one of those suckers who just has to see a movie to the end quoth the raven nevermore
being a fan of billy bob thornton and the diversity of his skills i noticed this movie listed and was surprised i hadn t heard of it i d traveled more than usual during both the period it was being filmed in and when it hit theaters more than years later that passage of time is the first clue all was not well with the production now patrick swayze can t act for sour apples but thornton has more than enough ability to make up for the difference between them and charlize theron is someone whom it would be a pleasure to see even if it showed her watching paint dry being curious i checked this site s production info it made a whopping per screen its opening weekend and just over each after its month s theater run in latter overall gross was k which i d doubt could cover cast and crew s hotel and food for a week on location the story is pretty benign and even the use of the usually interesting locale of reno is as dull as the rest of the goings on it s something like several snl bits all pieced together none individually too great at all and the overall presentation even worse whatever the expenses for this production had to be considerable even if all worked for less than their usual fees so the one thing which made it a barely tolerable opus was the quality of the filming and billy bob s present albeit understandably somewhat laconic here compared with his usual work think of the three superb totally diverse characters he portrayed in sling blade bandits and bad santa and you know he realized this work was below standard long before the viewers had the opportunity to confirm this one star for him even here and one because production was better than say the typical lifetime flick
this is one of the worst film adaptations of a musical ever made the stage version of a chorus line is wonderful this movie misses the mark in almost every way even the casting is baffling take audrey landers as val dance looks is val s song val s story is that she is a great dancer but a in the looks department yes she finds a solution but ultimately she s a great dancer what do the brilliant filmmakers do they hire an actress who can t dance and is famous for looking great way to miss the boat then there s the choreography i m sure michael bennett was turning over in his grave why didn t they use his choreography it really can t be improved upon
an ensemble of uninteresting and unlikeable characters twist and turn their way through a flimsy plot that might be interesting if only you could bring yourself to care this twisting and turning i speak of refers not to the story which contains all the suspense of a recipe for tuna casserole but to the director s inability to keep the characters faces even remotely centered in the frame on the other hand angie harmon has very nice nostrils and left ear the only real surprise in the movie is the big names they convinced to do it when you consider this movie was never released in theaters despite having an all star cast you might be inclined to think something stinks and indeed it does
warning possible spoiler if you can get by the extremely unpleasant subject matter this film does offer a heaping helping of outrageously campy melodrama surprisingly enough this movie has been copied and ripped off several times over the years although it s hard to fathom any filmmaker being inspired by this trashy drama neither one of the hemingway women can act here although mariel has improved over the years anne bancroft offers the only touch of class as a prosecuting attorney and chris sarandon is by turns pathetic and unintentionally hilarious as the smirking smarmy bad guy of the piece veteran director lamont johnson can t make a silk purse out of this sow s ear of a script which is stuffed to bursting with howlingly bad dialogue and outlandish situations for example the final sequence where margaux grabs her shotgun and chases sarandon down after his latest shocking act is meant to be exciting but elicits hearty chuckles instead add a notoriously shrill and spacy musical score by michel polnareff and you have a true guilty pleasure even though you re likely to feel grubby and needing a hot shower after viewing it don t say you weren t warned
it seems that the intention of the film was to show the aggressive maffia like character of russians or at least of those russians able to travel outside their big country that it is too easy to rob a bank in england and that british police is so inefficient that it cannot find the person who robbed the bank even when these subjects are leaving the country by air in addition nicole kidman and the supposed russian colleagues spoke a language not yet identified anywhere probably spoken by aliens in the ural mountains but far to be the russian one so nicole if you really want to talk russian kindly go to moscow or st petersburg and keep yourself busy learning russian language grammar and its pronunciation
a film starring salma hayek and colin farrell two respected and talented actors sounds like a great idea an independent film sounds even better the studios will control less of the content allowing the actors and writers and director more creativity but then why is this movie so bland ask the dust this film assumes right off the bat that we are deeply invested in the characters no one is given a proper back story so we don t ever know why the characters act the way they do explanations for physical and emotional scars are left to our imagination if you still have one left at the end of this movie i told a friend that i went to see this film and that i thought it was awful her question not even colin farrell could save it my response not even colin farrell s ass could save it
magnolia is a preposterous bewildering acting showcase that adds up to very little like eyes wide shut magnolia is an aimless series of episodes without any concern for coherence the camera swoops through hallways and corridors catching glimpses of sad characters where is the reason to care for these people the common theme seems to be people who yell a lot who can t care for others except for john c reilly s and philip seymour hoffman s characters and are self destructive jerks who are either falling to pieces or dying i was reminded of how much i disliked shine because of the irredeemable monster of a father played by armin mueller stahl there are so many unattractive unappealing characters here why would we want to spend time with them having said that there is nothing held back about magnolia paul thomas anderson s ideas are splashed onto his canvas with abandon there are two ideas in particular that bomb both happen in the last hour of this minute film one has the camera flipping from one character to another while each one sings one of aimee mann s coffeehouse folk songs sweet but ineffectual since we can t see what strings them all together the other idea i refer to cannot be revealed other than to say it is completely unexpected and completely ridiculous magnolia has a lot of great acting particularly tom cruise who unleashes a performance i didn t know he had in him and john c reilly plays maybe the most decent and truly good cop in recent memory but it all adds up to nothing when the secret unexpected event happened a girl behind me in the theatre couldn t hold it in any more and said this is stupid my feeling is the majority of moviegoers will agree
this movie no correction this thing this abysmal abomination from the burning pits of hell should have been killed before it even left the writer s head i could not possibly come up with enough adjectives to describe this movie but let s try anyway horrible bad nauseating tasteless crap vomit inducing gut wrenchingly bad hideous nasty putrid there just aren t enough words in the english language the plot involves a serial killer who becomes a snow man don t ask how not important the killer snowman runs about killing people how you may ask can a snowman kill someone in tasteless ways that make you want to remove your eyes if only so you don t have to endure that styrofoam snowman anymore in ways that make you want to fill your ears with hot wax so you do not have to endure his snow puns anymore don t watch this movie destroy it on sight for the sake of your very soul don t watch it
the first matrix movie was lush with incredible character development witty dialog and action scenes that kept with the flow of the story these elements coupled by incredible special effects of the day presented a magical ride that kept you in suspense the entire time enter matrix reloaded and its sequel revolutions the problem here isn t the special effects or the fight sequences as some may argue the brothers have taken well developed characters from the first film and hollowed them out like rotten tree logs the connection that was first established between viewers and on screen characters in the first film is lost when you realize these are not the same characters from the first matrix movie to wit morpheus was developed as a charismatic philosophical character with insight far exceeding anyone else in the movie but here in reloaded we re presented by a different morpheus who stands hard and hollow reduced to corny one liners that contradict the character we saw develop in the first film this character just didn t feel the same and this could also be said about the supporting characters in the movie the removal of tank was also a disappointment tank s involvement in the first film was minimal at best but he played the role extremely well in reloaded we discover that tank dies after the events in the first film and he is replaced by a jar jar binks stunt double that couldn t act to save his live think stale box of kellogg s corn flakes his performance left me chuckling throughout and most of his spoken dialog lacked timing there was an overwhelming sense that he was either trying too hard to convey his emotions on screen or the delivery in the script was off in either case the experience was humorous at times i felt embarrassed for the actor even neo s godly persona was suspect during most of the fighting sequences the alleyway battle with the agent smith clones was certainly exaggerated one must wonder for a man so gifted as neo that he would even waste his time engaging in such a fruitless frivolous battle when more pressing matters attend especially when you consider his ability to fly or his ungodly ability to bend the matrix certainly neo could have dispatched the clones much quicker and more efficiently again such acts lend themselves to a script hindered by consistency and scenes created as filler to keep us from feeling gypped in jest our expectations of the characters created in the first film are discarded promptly sadly for those expecting more of the same you will certainly walk away feeling gravely disappointed however if you take reloaded as your standard run of the mill action movie and forget the incredible story inconsistencies and the untwining of already established character development from the first film you should walk away feeling quite pleased
i realise that the us army was demoralised by but this film was unbelievable it was supposed to be a training camp not the ss punishment battalion in a sven hassell novel the writer must be a real army hater the psycho sergeant who kept beating the crap of people belonged in a prison cell and the useless black top sergeant should have been sacked as well these men were going overseas the receiving units would surely have wondered where all the unusable damaged recruits were coming from and an investigation would have ensued the scene that blew it completely was the electrocution one farrell the alleged barrack room lawyer would have had the instructor over a barrel for issuing an illegal order to torture pows in contravention to the geneva convention actual assault on an enlisted man sexual assault and conduct unbecoming an officer intead he just walks away after this discipline brakes down into a madhouse level and the film becomes unwatchable i don t know how it ended i went to bed
evidently lots of people really like this but i found it infantilising and reasonably offensive codswallop saved from oblivion by jane russell and a couple of memorable musical numbers especially the opener but there s a marked dip in invention later on i don t get on with monroe she s supposed to be playing a dumb blonde who ain t that dumb but she just comes over as dumb russell can t quite convince when she claims never to have been in a gymnasium but is otherwise rather wonderful the men are staggeringly uninteresting as is the plot by no means atrocious but so patchy that if this is a classic god help us all
acclaimed director mervyn leroy puts drama on film that competes with the best of soap operas high drama is found in the loves and infidelities in new york s social set oh yes don t forget jealousy can bring about tainted hearts and murder the all star cast features barbara stanwyck van heflin james mason ava gardner cyd charisse and nancy davis
greenaway s films pose as clever erudite and innovative yet his style and grammar originate and remind viewers of films made in the world war era of film making the frame composition use of mid shot the static camera it may be well to rub against mainstream movies with this style but it is not new perhaps like that other innovator ts eliot he draws more from the past than in looking forward as an authentic innovator would or could yet greenaway s biggest failing is that he cannot write his dialog and even plot structure is mechanical and logical but without the vitality of another dramatic logician brecht where this weakness is most apparent is in his humor which is poised and logical so the joke is dead before it s delivered the result is tedium if it s not funny it has failed ask a stand up comedian to justify their act if the audience doesn t respond perhaps the well read director could learn something from freud on humor finally like woody allen greenaway has manipulated his actors over the years to work like clones they speak the lines with a bored smug air like narcissistic adolescents this film despite its design and lighting is meretricious
i rented this shortly after renting ben stein s expelled and thought it would interesting to compare them before i go further it seems only fair that i point out the following so a reader can see if i m prejudiced or not i m trying to be objective for the record i tend to enjoy maher s hbo show now and then though i rarely think he s the source of the humor i don t really care for his stand up either but he makes some good points on the show now and again and i liked politically incorrect though he was still fairly politically correct which i deem a negative because the very term sounds orwellian or at least fascist as for my religious views i ll say for simplicity s sake that i m a non denom christian with some views that are objectivist and some that are agnostic mixed in that being said this a bad documentary for reasons that haven t been touched on yet by many reviewers though the ones mentioned are valid too the reason it s not convincing isn t just that he argues the main point without letting others talk and his point boils down to nothing logical either it s just come on really which isn t a point just a question try david hume if you want a decent argument the reason this isn t convincing lies in his lack of experts on the subject matter i saw this about months ago and i only recall him talking to one person whose credentials as a professional were mentioned if he wasn t a clergyman there are probably hundreds of scientists or at least professors with masters or doctorates willing to do a bit of verbal sparring particularly in the fields of history anthropology or a host of others if one compares this to ben stein s expelled no intelligence allowed he ll find that stein interviews about credentialed professors professionals clergy etc he does this with a variety of sources with various backgrounds he also makes a point in his film regarding freedom of thought and education maher could easily have pointed out wrongs committed by theocratic rules throughout centuries or persecutions from this instead he idiotically refers to the th century s secular totalitarian regimes as evidence of why secularism needs more socio political power it s in the bonus features where he s standing in front of the anne frank house i think this is a true orwellian head trip he blames christianity in particular on many pointless deaths which has had its share though far smaller than most without even including a basic view of the evidence perhaps this is because that argument is dwarfed by secular humanism s miserable record of the th century alone another glaring weakness is his unwillingness to talk to anyone that would be considered a moderate or average practitioner he picks out the weakest gazelles of the herd how difficult is that how does proving the existence of exceptions move toward disproving the general rule it does not wow so people in cults think outside of the norm how enlightening to know this great work maher again it would be fairly easy to interview someone like laurence vance and include his work on refuting the idea of patriotic duty that demands a person fight in any war his country is involved in beyond all that he s just not that funny here some of the clips that are overlaid in clever out of context irreverent ways might garner a laugh but mostly work to illustrate how a real contextual argument from maher will not be forthcoming much less convincing he spends most of his time bashing christians spouting inaccuracies and interviewing fringe groups that he doesn t allow to really answer his questions for the record there are good questions to honestly ask of religious folks and many they should ask of themselves he touches on almost none of these i get the feeling that i could ve responded much better to most of his questioning than the people he interviewed but the whole thing reeks of deck stacking in terms of what is included and what was edited out
i don t know where to start the acting the special effects and the writing are all about as bad as you can possibly imagine i can t believe that the production staff reached a point where they said our job is done time for it s release i m just glad the first two in the series never made it as far as the uk i would actually recommend watching this film just so you can appreciate how well made most films are i don t know how any of the other imdb users could find it scary when the terrifying dinosaurs waddle down corridors with rubber arms flailing around
about time they released this movie on dvd i know some say wb rush the release of this movie because of the dreamgirls movie but how can you rush the release of a movie that s been in you catalog since i m very disappointed with the dvd release of this movie no special feature no dd sound come on wb you can do much better then this the audio and picture quality on this movie needs some serious help seem wb didn t place as much time and attention to this movie because it is a black movie and my have okay sales they could have kept the cd which by the way dose not have all the songs the original cd has would i recommend this dvd for purchase yes because it is a classic film but wb need to go add some more special feature take notes from other group movies the five heatbeats or the temptation were you may view just the performance and the sound on both are much much much better than this dvd
no artful writeup here because it doesn t deserve one not an art film not even one of those hidden gems you know like those movies you hear about through a friend who saw this amazing movie downtown where they show all the good independents and art films just pack it into the christmas boxes and dispose of quickly
i was duped into seeing this movie after reading a positive review from another website and man was i p o d it took me at least minutes to pick it up off the shelf b c i didn t want anyone to see me then another minutes to build the courage to take it to the counter and actually use real money to rent it i thought that all my stress would pay off by the time i got home to and watching the movie b c the review i read said the movie was a pleasant surprise what a joke if you can make it through the first hour of the movie then your in luck b c it s not until then the movie turn s into a horror don t bother with this one folks your better off watching dankness falls
this barely watchable film was a bit of an ordeal to sit through none of the segments are good but at least the first one was mildly amusing and the middle one was somewhat imaginative the final one was just plain brutal and after sitting through two weak comedic shorts the third one was truly painful to watch even by the low standards of a national lampoon movie this one seemed especially boring and joyless
in order to hold the public s attention for three hours we were treated not so much to a family s romp through four generations and years of hungarian history as to sexual liaisons with a sister a sister in law and other adulteries oh yes there was also a totally gratuitous rape having said all this the first story of the relationship among the children of the patriarch was fresh and sensual thanks to jennifer ehle
this film is about a family trying to come to terms with the death of the mother wife by moving to genova italy the plot of genova sounds promising but unfortunately it is empty and without focus the film only consists of a collection of scenes depicting the daily life of the family such as swimming taking piano lessons or cooking eggs most of such scenes are redundant and tiresome completely failing to engage viewers emotionally the ending is very disappointing as it is not spectacular moving or emotional i can safely say that i am disappointed and bored by genova the only thing good about the film is the sunny weather and the beauty of genova genova can serve as an extended tourism advertisement for the city but not as a film to be enjoyed
full house is one of the worst tv series ever why because all the characters are so irritating that it s impossible to bear the best character is joey an even he is pretty irritating occasionally an that girl dj who wrote her character i want to kill my self every time she speaks not to mention when danny start s with his philosophy example dj won around ten thousand dollars or more in the casino however she s not eighteen so she shouldn t gamble according to law however the casino was ready to pay her the money but then danny her father cought s her and don t let s her raise that money because she is not eighteen oh come on give me a break will ya since i ve seen that stupid and childish scene i instantly turned off the television some of the thing s they say in this series not even a child would bought who in the world could think that full house is entertaining and funny every single word they say in this series seem s like shakespeare wrote it except that shakespere knew how to write and except that he wouldn t be that childish and stupid to write something as stupid as they wrote in the script for the full house for everyone who has a bad heart or any kind of bad medical condition or any will for life or any sense of the real world i deeply recommend do not watch the full house not even one episode as a try out avoid this series save your self from stupidity and nonsense this is the worst television show ever i d rather watch teletubbies then this do not watch this
pretty bad movie offers nothing new the usual creaks and moans attempt to make up for a muddled but thin story acting is barely above pathetic why liam neeson signed on for this is anyone s guess owen wilson truly turns in one of the worst performances in recent horror movie history catherine zeta jones is fun to look at and not much else although lili tayor did an above average job the special effects were fairly memorable and the house itself was breathtaking and hauntingly gorgeous however they can t makeup for the poor acting and the storyline which appears to have been thrown together at the last minute don t bother
i didn t think it was possible for a horror comedy film to fail so abysmally on both fronts really awful the fact that it doesn t take itself seriously usually a good thing works against it primarily because the actors are so wooden you really would swear they are reading cue cards on the upshot though the mst k version as always has a few laughs
as someone who was staggered at the incredible visuals of hero i was anxious to see this film which was billed as being along the same lines but better it also featured an actress i like ziyi zhang well i was disappointed on both counts i bought the dvd of this film sight unseen and that was a mistake it was not better i realize these flying through the air martial arts films are pure fantasy but this story is stretched so far past anything remotely believable it just made me shake my head in disappointing disbelief a blind woman defeating hundreds of opponents sorry that s going a little far also the major male character jin takeshi kaneshiro was so annoying with his dialog stupid look on his face and stupid laugh that he ruined the film too despite the wonderful colors and amazing action scenes this story to me just didn t have an appeal to make it a movie worth owning this film is no hero of mine
i have seen some pretty bad movies and this is right up there no plot to speak of it s like one of those bad coma episodes on a soap opera i just wanted to smack that little girl because well lets just say she s real suspicious all the way through the movie the monsters running around wearing some bling was funny i also saw a bit of silent hill in there and i read that this was done by and or stared a finnish metal band lordi so it s no wonder that it didn t make much sense it seem to be a vehicle for promoting there band and nothing more the fx are very good the look of the movie the monsters and even the acting also good but the story and the telling of it just aren t there
the club has to be the single most bigoted television program in the history of television itself to make matters worse it s been on the air since implying that thousands if not millions of people are buying into its hate and lies headed by pat robertson the unscrupulous megalomaniacal founder and leader of the christian coalition the club takes us from misinformation to misunderstanding broadcasting news as they like to think of it and trying to convince its audience that all of the world s problems are to blame on homosexuals wiccans new age spiritualists muslims jews hindus non fundamentalist christians democrats single mothers foreigners feminists evolutionists environmentalists nasa scientists and anyone else who doesn t share their fanatical religious views it s actually the best fake news since the daily show or the weekend update segment of saturday night live or since fox news for that matter of course pat s always the one who makes each of the decisions saying whatever comes to mind and not giving a damn who it offends or hurts in the meantime he continues his part in the struggle to transform the united states into a militarized police state by having the religious wrong stick their noses in everything they can and asking for one donation after another no less than a measly to become a member by the way to fund pat s african diamond mines and buy oil from companies reprimanded by the government in the past for their abuse of the environment no never mind that pat was good friends with the genocidal dictators of zaire and zimbabwe in order to help him acquire such wealth it s all for the greater glory of god don t you know and of course the hosts of the club are always willing to read letters written by viewers as they like to put it coincidentally each typed in the same format and all on the same color of paper by viewers supposedly healed of various afflictions by the said hosts they claim to have words of knowledge come to them but who never appear on the program to say what happened to them honestly how can anyone take a show seriously when they re using a poor applause recording it should make people wonder why there s no studio audience the sad thing that pat s cronies and viewers don t realize or just don t want to realize are the horrible things he s done and said this is a guy who agreed with jerry falwell that the september terrorist attacks on the united states were the result of god punishing us for our acceptance of homosexuality and feminism ironic considering that pat has twice publicly referred to the implementation of a nuclear weapon in the state department i have little doubt it was his wealth that kept him from getting arrested for such statements his rants against homosexuals single mothers and any number of sexual practices he considers sinful are interesting considering he was known to frequent a number of brothels during the korean war as the bible says be fruitful and multiply so congratulations pat thanks to you there s probably a number of children born to single korean mothers then of course there was the time he called for the assassination of venezuelan president hugo chavez not that he s a saint but still oh yes and let s not soon forget the time this crusader for human life supported forced abortions in china very christian of him wouldn t you say and just in case pat has forgotten i haven t forgotten his little speech that evangelical christians today are being treated exactly as the jews were in nazi germany honestly to compare his plight to the horrors of the holocaust is almost unforgivable speaking of which need i mention about how he blatantly lied that homosexuality ran rampant among the nazi party in a pathetic attempt to discredit homosexuals of course history shows us that the nazis acted toward homosexuals the same way they acted toward jews pat robertson is one of the biggest liars in history if he was pinocchio his nose would encircle the earth unfortunately more and more people continue to believe him every day this is your wake up call people the club is one of the most if not the single most vile program in television history it s evil masquerading as good it s a wolf in sheep s clothing it s bigoted filth that tries to look clean pretty and loving it s living proof that hateful dangerous religious views aren t confined to certain groups in the middle east even those who are not of the christian faith know that it goes against everything jesus taught and if jesus was to appear to this club he wouldn t be emulating them instead he d be chastising them as he did the pharisees of his time and overturning the money bins of their telethons as he did in front of the synagogue in his time all i can say is thank god that pat had no chance of becoming president if he did he d be the harbinger of armageddon and not on the side of the good guys
someone must have been seriously joking when they made this film firstly it is an absolute impossibility that this movie was made in the fashions and music dictate that this is seriously s my guess is that this has sat on the shelf for a long while before some crazed distributer picked it up and released it to a disbelieving world there is a plot kind of a strange loner meets a random man with a beard who tells him that if he meditates while singing his favourite song he will be able to turn into whomever he chooses at this point i feel obliged to point out that the loner s favourite song is london bridge is falling down why is this his favourite song because he s an idiot we are only a minute into the film and already the film has reached a monumental level of stupidity it gets even stupider the loner is the nostril picker i can only assume this as there are two scenes in the film where he is seen picking his nose that clears up the title he decides to change into a girl so that he can get close to other girls and kill them that s more or less it the acting is universally appalling every single performance in this movie sucks in fact i would go so far as to say that the acting is of the standard of a pornographic movie it really is that terrible the nostril picker appears to the audience as the nostril picker the characters in the movie see him as the girl he has become through singing london bridge is falling down man i feel like an idiot even typing this anyway it is kind of strange seeing a middle aged weirdo hanging out with school girls and not in a good way there is even an extended montage of scenes where the nostril picker is at school with the girls and a song plays over the top it is very possibly the worst song ever recorded i m not even going to describe it you ll know it when you hear it and you ll agree with me there are some scenes of violence sure and there is a benny hill style chase sequence involving a transsexual there is even an immortal bit of dialogue that may or may not have been taken from shakespeare or john milton where the nostril picker says to a prostitute i ve got the cash if you ve got the gash lovely i m sure you ll agree utter nonsense
pay no attention to the comments behind the curtain the majority of people leaving positive comments about this film must be receiving royalties this is a horrible film in every way imagine high school kids with no money and no sense of humor making a slasher comedy video they would receive a d for this college kids would receive an f or asked to leave the school since this monstrosity was made by professionals i believe there should be jail time or at least cinema probation i enjoy watching bad movies like plan from outer space but this thing doesn t even fall into that category the script acting sound and directing are so bad that it is virtually unwatchable if you enjoy watching bad films that are amusing stick with ed wood blaxploitation or s horror films after viewing this you get the feeling you ve wasted an hour and a half of your life
jennifer cassi gina philips from dead and breakfast returns back to the house she grew up in which she recently inherited from her deceased sister unbeknownst to her grandmother fay dunaway who s still living in it jennifer decides to sell it as she s in dire need of the money much to granny s chagrin she also begins to have troublesome recurring nightmares of a mysterious raven there was really no one to relate to in this film jennifer seemed cold distant unsentimental and narcissistic whereas the grandmother seemed spiteful sad and also narcissistic the film is good and well made but with no one to empathize with i found it hard to care about what happened to them my grade c
terrible story poor acting and no humour at all apart from the final joke at the end some sort of ugly angel is sent to earth to save a boy and his mum from being thrown out of their home supposed to be a kiddies movie but even they will not be amused by this terrible film
no doubt frank sinatra was a talented actor as well as a talented singer after all very few actors nowadays can get a scene just right in one take and that was pretty much sinatra s modus operandi on set i feel that as the s wore on the quality of the man s films really started to tank the tony rome detective series was nothing short of trying to compete with dean martin s matt helm series which came out at the same time perhaps even a james bond competition but nothing really worked for frank during these years his personal life in shambles his music fading out sinatra appeared more like a throwback to the s the last great sinatra film of this period was probably von ryan s express in
this is one of the worst movies i have seen to date the best part was christian j meoli leonard attempting to act jumping up and down outside the bar kind of like i wanted to do on the dvd to spare the rest of humanity the agony of watching this shitty film it has a great cast so you keep watching waiting for it to get good i mean with sean astin andrew played his part perfectly did a great job too bad it was in this film kyra sedgwick bevan ron livingston chad ren e zellweger poet they put her name on the cover she has a total of line and less then seconds in the whole movie if the cast had any dignity they would go out and buy all the copies of this film and burn them along with writer director george hickenlooper and writer john enbom
why did i waste my money on this on the last day of sundance i want a refund can i have my back while i was watching this film i kept waiting for something to happen nothing did happen the only way i even knew what it was supposed to be about was by reading the plot which was not really like the film why did the director zoom in with their handy cam and then zoom out it was not very artistic why did the director show lulu filing her nails for fifteen minutes why is it when the actors tried to speak they sounded like they were reading or was that the point i felt like phantom love had no story at all and to be honest i felt like my friends vacation videos had a much higher entertainment value than this film
i actually felt bad for the actors in this thing no doubt a high school drama class could do a better job or at the very least as well a job the actors must have thought this would be their big chance working in a film it certainly was not besides the terrible acting the stories were boring and for the most part predictable the one about the remote control didn t even make any sense to bad cause it had the best premise in the bunch i m all for supporting low budget films and giving new film makers a fair chance but this turkey is a waste of time and an insult to the viewer i only watched it because of some good comments posted here they must have been planted by people with ties to the film you may fool people into watching this but you can t fool them into liking what they saw i gave it a instead of a because at least the boxer story tried to be heart warming sure it failed miserably but it tried i reserve s for the worst of the worst do yourself a favor and skip this dribble i wish i had
this movie was amusing at times hell sometimes it was even downright funny the underlying message i got from the film though was that women are responsible for all of the troubles of man every time a woman is depicted in the film she is being lazy being slutty or lambasting some poor guy for no apparent reason i don t think the message involved is good for women or gay men but it is a comedy and a piece of art so it is simply someones point of view even if i don t agree with it they are still entitled to it an amusing film but some of the comments others have made are just plain stupid best film ever my foot
cause they re both pretty lousy i think the best part of the movie is the horrendously imperial picture of faye dunaway at the top of the stairs she looks like she could very easily step out of that picture rip someone to bloody pieces and calmly re enter the portrait looking as if nothing had happened now you know a movie s in trouble when part of the set furnishings manages to attract your attention i admit i paid for the dvd just so i could see faye dunaway in a contemporary horror movie i know what you re thinking bucks right down into a gaping black hole and you would be absolutely correct this movie sucks there it s right out in the open i was expecting some actual scares and i waited and waited and waited none came the raven probably a crow in makeup didn t scare me seeing small pieces of internal organs didn t scare me and even faye didn t scare me i m not that brave i know so it must be the movie itself that is the trouble what s more jennifer wasn t scared either her internal organs were literally falling apart and she seemed more peeved than anything her life was rapidly coming to a close and she s worried about attaining more money honey you can t take money where you re going i need money she continually says completely ignoring the fact that her lungs have collapsed and ceased to function meanwhile i spent the whole blasted movie wondering what was up with the grandmother faye i was suspicious at first faye playing a grandmother and all and i was still suspicious at the end there is another relative living in the house that jennifer and mary ellen the grandmother from hell are forced to share temporarily and i m guessing she is of the same generation as said grandmother here s the weird part the relative looks like she s just endured her eight hundredth birthday party mary ellen looks like she s just gotten a face lift from a renowned surgeon face lifts can t work miracles but i think faye s appearance is important to the rice paper plot spoiler it seems that the family is plagued by an illness that affects bad acting sorry my little joke seriously though there s all illness that causes their organs to fail and ultimately disintegrate yuck huh interestingly enough mary ellen is still alive and all her organs are intact how did she avoid the family curse something s up with her obviously another reason for mourning the loss of my thirty dollars this movie features one of my all time movie pet peeves i refer to the double ending this movie ends twice i absolutely hate it when that happens and in this movie it feels like the director shot the ending didn t like it and forget to remove it during editing i guess it s supposed to be scary but it is only if you re a film editor there is one perk to this debacle though and it s one of the reasons i bought the dvd the filmmaker commentary features faye dunaway and i wanted to see how she acted when she didn t have lines to recite guess what the movie sucked so bad i wasn t able to sit through it again drat
this is shallow hedonism and or social commentary wrapped in a tragic tale about a jealous young woman s scheme to drive apart her father and his fianc e is it incest or just a view through the eyes of a daughter with an electra complex who cares all of the characters except for anne deborah kerr are vacuous and vile seberg is poor i agree with the boys with breasts comment of an earlier review the plot plodded this predictable material was sufficient for about minutes of film that unfortunately was stretched over an hour and a half if you want to see great gowns and jewels on the riviera i recommend to catch a thief in which you will get the added bonuses of an entertaining story and likable characters i like for films to entertain me i personally don t really care where a film is set whatever the time or place i want a good story comedy or drama i also want to see some enjoyable characters it doesn t hurt if i can relate to them poor deborah kerr gives a typically good performance and so does david niven in a despicable role the rating is solely for kerr and niven and for the cinematography the rich color scenes and the murky foreboding black and white scenes unfortunately all the great cinematography in the world cannot salvage a poor story with un enjoyable characters a sow s ear is still a sow s ear consequently watching this mess was a serious waste of my time
what else is left to say i ve read all the reviews here and most are right on however one person even went so far as to call this movie evil and that satan tainted it or something along those lines evil wow what a shocker i mean tbn basically made this film open your eyes please anway this was the very lowest grade of propoghanda nonsense that has come along in years the most terrifying thing about omega code is how much money they spent to make it if this movie can be made there are no limits and therefore we have no choice but to get ready for yentl and ernest loses the omega codes for those of you who are into the biblical stories the new movie dogma will pickup where omega code never started
five minutes after watching this i logged on to imdb to warn all of you out there not to bother with this movie genre horror it had moments of mild suspense and throughout the whole movie i was thinking to myself somethings gotta happen soon it did not when the movie ended i felt so embarrassed for the writer director i ve never been the biggest fan of patrick rea this guy just does not know how to make movies and after watching this sorry excuse of a horror flick i ve gone from not been the biggest fan to will not watch another of his works i was taken in by the plot summary please don t make the same mistake i gave this movie a for the actors they were not bad and it wasn t there fault they got such bad direction
i absolutely adore the book written by robin klein so i was very excited when i heard that a movie based on the book was in the making but i was severely disappointed with the movie when i did see it because it didn t capture what i loved about the book the absolutely ridiculously funny erica and the interesting way in which she views the world from the start of the movie i realised that things weren t the same as i had imagined in the book so i just went along for the ride it wasn t all that bad i guess miss belmont was totally different to what i had imagined her to be i didn t think she would be one to smoke and drink jean kittson who plays her is hilarious on it s own i thought the movie and it s actors actresses in it did a good job but alas i m such a fan of the book one of my all time favourite books that i couldn t help but feel disappointed p
pedantic overlong fabrication which attempts to chronicle the birth of the federal bureau of investigations begins quite promisingly with a still relevant probe into an airplane explosion however the melodrama involving james stewart and wife vera miles just gets in the way miles had a habit of playing tepid wives under duress and her frayed nerves arrive here right on schedule esteemed director mervyn leroy helmed this adaptation of don whitehead s book but despite the talent involved the picture fails to make much of an impression best performance is turned in by murray hamilton as stewart s partner however most of the dialogue is ludicrous and the dogged pacing causes the movie to seem twice as long as it is from
this was an absolutely terrible movie don t be lured in by christopher walken or michael ironside both are great actors but this must simply be their worst role in history even their great acting could not redeem this movie s ridiculous storyline this movie is an early nineties us propaganda piece the most pathetic scenes were those when the columbian rebels were making their cases for revolutions maria conchita alonso appeared phony and her pseudo love affair with walken was nothing but a pathetic emotional plug in a movie that was devoid of any real meaning i am disappointed that there are movies like this ruining actor s like christopher walken s good name i could barely sit through it
a so common horror story about a luxury building at brooklyn which hides the gates to hell it is reminiscent of polanski s the tenant released a year before the sentinel but is too far from the movie of the polish filmmaker in any aspect possible the tenant was so disturbing whereas the sentinel is not at all what it s more surprising from this film is the cast it is full of great names of american cinema burguess gardner wallach veteran actors acting for food i guess verdict barely entertaining my rate
as others have mentioned this movie is similar to the fly both versions and the lesser known sci fi flick altered states the big difference is that those two movies were well made by people who knew what they were doing and were good at it metamorphosis did not have these advantages metamorphosis is a potentially interesting science fantasy story that had the wrong people in charge of it and the wrong actors playing the roles the story follows scientist dr peter houseman gene lebrock an obsessed man working on a genetic cure to aging and death when the university he works for threatens to cut funding he decides to inject the anti aging serum into himself as a result dr houseman spends the rest of the movie slowly turning into a lizard and oh yes watching the good doctor go through the process of becoming that lizard is a great joy it really is so bad that it s good some of the lines are classic what was it a nightmare from the past many of the reviews that i ve read for this point up how stupid and ridiculous the last five minutes of this movie are i m just going to go ahead and spoil it the good doctor goes from being a shuffling half man half lizard thing to being what appears to be a man in a rejected godzilla costume when the police finally gun him down in the final scene some obnoxious kid is seen with a little pet lizard which he claims will never die and the movie s heroine sally donnelly catherine baranov evidently decides that the little lizard is the final incarnation of dr houseman the camera then gives us a close up of the lizard s face this is i assume the director s way of showing us that the lizard is evil yes it is goofy but i fell over laughing so i can t complain i watched this movie because it was a part of the chilling classics movie megapack that i purchased i m sure many of those who are reading this did exactly the same thing as the pack is the only way to see this movie on dvd if you have recently bought the boxed set and haven t watched this movie yet it really is worth your time even if i did just ruin the ending for you it might also be possible to find this movie online for free
warning it contains spoilers if a movie starts with a sex scene then it s a bad movie see for example this one confirms the above lemma the second scene constitutes the spinning center of all the action the fact that we know the end makes the movie boring even more other plots are revealed as the story goes back and forth several times and this made more frustrated to compensate the consequent lack of suspense we learn more and more about how unbalanced are the characters and oh yes they have lots to show andy p hoffman for example is a drug addict more he is cheating his wife more he plans to rob his father more his wife is cheating with his brother more he doesn t regret his complicity to his mother s death more he is a serial killer more etc etc it s not enough space to write here i wonder how could he have a top job and why his wife didn t leave him before on the other hand i enjoy much the performances of the actor hoffman even here psh saves what is left from my spent for this absurdity why absurdity because it doesn t have sense why should i care for the despicable characters another broken lemma is that a movie should have a sympathetic at least pleasant character also it s a lot of sentimentality for example we are supposed to care for the sufferance of the widowed father without knowing anything about the parents lives before the crime
unashamedly ambitious sci fi from kerry conran for whom this is clearly a labour of love unfortunately it s just not that good it all starts well enough with an epic but restrained score a mixture of lucas and hitchcock style editing and the glossy cinematography of a spielberg the movie also references many pulp sci fi novels serials and films as diverse as the day the earth stood still superman metropolis planet of the apes the iron giant star wars and the spy who loved me the film however fails to be as good as any one of those for several reasons the main being that it s such a labour of love so concerned with throwing everything at the screen and creating a brave new world conran actually forgets about making a movie there is little to no tension atmosphere or magic on offer here despite aerial battles dinosaurs and race against time set pieces even the noir elements fall flat this is a broad way of looking at things though those elements mainly fail because nothing feels at all real and is so obviously fake the green screen just looks like a video game half the time and it s obvious the actors have been pasted on afterwards the actors don t get to do much either jude law is wooden gwyneth paltrow is annoying and stupid angelina jolie is wasted and it s all because of an awful script the sort that has to explain nearly everything it is a decent experience and some might get a nostalgia feel but ultimately this is a pointless step into the world of yesterday nice ending though
if i had known this movie was filmed in the exasperating and quease inducing dogme style i would never have rented it nevertheless i took a dramamine for the seasickness and gave it a shot i lasted a very very very long forty minutes before giving up it s just boring pretentious twaddle the last french movie i saw was romance and it too was pretty dismal but at least the camera was steady and not breathing down the necks of the characters all the time i am baffled at the continuing popularity of dogme overseas it ll catch on in america about the same time as the next big outbreak of leprosy it s called dogme because that s the average number of times the actors are poked in the eye by the camera
too bad i really like kristen cloke and gary busey but the director failed to put this together there s a lot of action a lot of promise but it all comes off hokey the director didn t do his job promising action comes off lame so much seems contrived in a desperate attempt to save the film this version of the rage directv credits it as simply isn t worth the time to watch it another director would have done a better job
the hazing is one of them films i always wanted to see solely based on the illustrated cover image here on imdb yes that s how shallow i am i don t care if ten million people call it a crap movie the poster looks awesome so i guess i ll just have to see it now the hazing can somewhat be described like its alternate title curious the poster and title make it sound like a genuine horror movie set on campus and dealing with sinister initiation rites but this movie is actually more of a crossbreed between comedy and thriller first of all there s something very wrong with the tagline on the old vhs box i watched it says he had good grades a good girl and good buddies until they put him through the hazing that s not the case actually protagonist gilbert lewis is finally accepted by an acclaimed campus through an athletics scholarship it takes over half the movie before we even hear about his girlfriend back home and the only buddy he has is a very nerdy charles martin smith still with hair in this film both of them are approached to become members of the prestigious delts fraternity but during their hazing exam in which they have to descend a mountain dressed in their tidy white undies barney falls off a cliff and breaks his leg when lewis returns with the other frat boys barney froze to death already together they intended to keep the body frozen for five days and then claim he never returned from a weekend ski trip with barney s body hidden in the cafeteria freezer lewis has to cover for him so that barney s absence doesn t look suspicious the set up of the hazing is quite original and potentially innovative but the problem here is that the execution could easily have been a lot better the tone is too steady and too serious for a comedy movie even a black one but on the other hand there aren t any proper attempts to build up suspense or thrills neither the soundtrack is cheerful and full of light headed tunes but that s nearly not enough to make this film a comedy around an hour into the film the plot also runs out of steam and idea and the makers have no better alternative to fill up the emptiness with romantic compilations of lewis and his outer town girlfriend biking through the countryside i didn t like the final twist because it s quite implausible and because it has been done numerous times before and after though admittedly after the hazing is not a complete waste of time but still i m glad i found an ex rental tape at a friend s house instead of having to spend any money on the recently released dvd
james bond in the wilderness well that s the way it looks pierce brosnan is after all best known as bond in tommorrow never dies and golden eye both shot prior to this release frankly the film s two leads are both badly miscast with brosnan turning in the marginally more convincing performance and with annie galipeau as pony grey owl s love interest having to battle with carelessly written dialogue the two aunts on the other hand are perfect but the film is not about aunts it is about the wilds of the canadian wilderness and while the photography may be pretty there is no grit to the harsh reality of living in the wilds annie galipeau as pony just fails to be convincing unfortunately because i really wanted to believe in her she was a relatively inexperienced twenty year old on this film and it could have worked but richard attenborough was maybe just not tough enough on her he makes her look vulnerable which of course she is but in the wrong sort of way but one thing for sure she appears picture perfect throughout but mascara and eyebrow thickener in the wilderness it just doesn t fit especially as she only ever seems to walk forest trials with bond sorry grey owl and use photo ops for kissing close ups i ve lived with forest people in the pacific north west and they simply don t look this pretty and stay so sweet while fighting for survival which brings me to another point the film fails to evoke the period in which it is set the s i put the blame here largely on a lack lustre script that is keen on preaching at the expense of dramatic arc plot points and those small details that can evoke period through action william nicholson wrote the screenplay and his latest offering elizabeth the golden age opened three days ago so i do hope there is an improvement yes i ve read the comments others have posted but i m not convinced a lot of potential but mishandled and even maybe ill conceived if it had had a religious film it would have been panned but because it preaches environmentalism the film remains somewhat above criticism since it is politically correct sorry for all that i don t buy it amen
is this the same kim ki duk who directed the poignant life spanning testimonial of spring summer fall winter and spring the same kim ki duk who directed the exquisite nearly silent heartbreaking longing of iron the same kim ki duk who dazzled us with the staggering tragedy of the coast guard and made us squirm about the ugliness of nonchalant teenage prostitution before returning to his almost patented nature motif to allow us all characters and viewers alike to experience redemption in samaritan girl i just cannot seem to find him in this film oh sure kim s nature motif is still present the film takes place entirely on a lake surrounded by mountains and on fishing floats resting placidly on the surface of calm waters yes it s kim ki duk all right kim even describes the film as beautiful in an interview included in the dvd s special features but i m not sure anymore what that means after viewing this putrescent presentation what is beautiful about angry potty mouthed prostitutes lustful violent and potty mouthed fishermen a covetous mute merchant explicit animal torture sequences of self mutilation and a pace that swings nauseatingly between bestial carnality and mindless brutality these are the only elements of humanity that present themselves in this utterly confounding and ultimately pointless film if it is based on a fable or intended as a parable or is meant to be symbolic of something greater this reviewer is unfamiliar with the source material it has been favorably compared to audition by japanese director takashi miike much to kim s satisfaction but aside from some astonishingly good performances especially given what they had to work with by lead actors seo jung and kim yoo suk i find little reason to recommend this film i have not seen audition but i doubt it would alter in any way my view of the isle its violence is pornographic and senselessly sadistic its sex is not pornographic but passionless and masochistic characters behave on irritating impulse because there is no plot its point is either non existent or i will admit lost amidst korean cultural quirks that i fail to understand the only beauty is in the cinematography which is classic kim fog shrouded boats lapping slowly across a serene lake mountainous terrain dominating the background and an imaginative and playful use of color at times it seems as if viewers are locked in a big kim ki duk romper room some touches like the mysterious and seductive mute merchant played by jung and the pleasantly odd use of motorbikes are intriguing but as a film this effort is downright confusing and in the end offensive to the senses not necessarily to sensibilities one hopes that kim will leave this kind of film making in the trash heap of his past for we know he is capable of so much more
steve martin should quit trying to do remakes of classic comedy he absolutely does not fit this part like the woeful remake of the out of towners this movie falls flat on it s face how anybody ever thought steve martin could even come close to jack lemmon s wonderful performance is beyond me and the same is true for this movie dan ackroyd could have played the bilko part better martin is great when doing his own original characters but fails miserably trying to recreate other people s classic work it s a sad statement when the funniest part of a movie is contained in the first line of the credits when the movie is over the line the producers gratefully acknowledge the total lack of cooperation by the united states army was just about the only line that actually made me laugh if you want to see the real bilko get hold of the original episodes of the phil silvers show those are guaranteed to make you laugh unlike this mistake that should never have happened i put this movie in the same category as the aforementioned lemmon classic and the remake of psycho none of them should ever have happened
i dunno sometimes you try and try and try to be charitable towards all the b thru z grade movies out there but once in a while a particular movie just tests your patience until you want to slap everyone involved bat people which i saw under the title it lives by night is just such a movie you can t watch this without thinking that it really should have been an episode on night gallery and not one of the better ones either the movie has something to do with a doctor who gets bitten by a bat and consequently starts to morph into a were bat who drinks human blood actually you d think if he was turning into a real bat he d be eating mosquitoes by the gallon bucket but because this is a cheap lurid horror movie blood s the word in spite of the fact that he has grand mal seizures at the drop of a hat and black out episodes almost every night his friend and fellow physician dr mustache aspen extreme insists that he s just having an allergic reaction to the rabies shots meanwhile the world s most obnoxious and stereotyped county sheriff suspects the doc of being responsible for the brutal murder and exsanguination of several local girls and one wino also meanwhile the doctor s wife decides that denial is a river in egypt and alternately patronizes him and nags him to distraction it s not so much that the acting is bad you can tell that the actors are making professional level choices and are trying to bring some juice and life to the script even the guy who plays the sheriff okay it is pretty bad but it s bad in a clich d wooden professional way it s just that everything about the acting the way the scenes are paced the costumes the dialog the script and the story line in general sets your teeth on edge and makes you want to well slap everyone involved i think the movie had an outside chance at being a spooky unsettling little cult favorite but the director needed to beat michael pataki an experienced character actor with a chair until pataki agreed to act and not just channel dennis weaver he also needed to find a script that made a little more sense with regard to the whole bat bites human who then turns into a bat scenario he also needed the actor who played the doctor to find a little more physically believable bit of stage business for his episodes instead of resorting to man has a seizure page from the little golden book of clich d acting mannerisms he needed to rework the whole wife character make her both more intelligent less shrill and waaaaay more observant i would never voluntarily watch this film again except with the help of mike and the bots it s bad but it isn t bad in a silly humorous or interesting way still better than battlefield earth or waterworld though
some guy gets whacked right out in plain sight this other guy shoots him he s got some bodyguards and they whack the killer but a reporter gets interested she goes to the hospital where they took the guy who got whacked she walks in and corners one bodyguard but he doesn t feel like talking i can t figure out why it s not like anyone else is interested she s the only reporter there anyway her editor discourages her from working on this lame story but hey she does anyway she goes to see the killer s sister mom a few minutes after she leaves they get whacked big time somebody blows up their trailer huge ball of fire then she searches out the bodyguard from the hospital she finds him hungover on his boat but a minute later they re both underwater sucking on a scuba tank cause three guys are trying to whack them and have blown up the boat big time huge ball of fire the reporter and the bodyguard whack two of the guys who are trying to whack them in the course of the next hour another guy gets whacked crossing the street there s a shootout with several stiffs in a warehouse some car chases with wreckage death a fake suicide etc etc lotsa stiffs all kindsa carnage great stuff but what the reporter and the bodyguard can t figure is why in hell the original guy got whacked what s the motivation of course it might help us to figure out why the reporter s even interested through almost all of this she s the only reporter on the story nobody else in the media cares not even with all the big fireballs and dead bodies true the original guy who got whacked wasn t exactly a celebrity his job was a little bit dull he was just the president yeah the one who lives in the white house oh and the bodyguard is a secret service agent is that the spoiler it should be after all there are no tv cameras no other print reporters no bloggers just another one of those police blotter crimes so what s the spoiler lemme think no wait the spoiler is that his wife did it yeah the first lady she was p ed because the president was fooling around and she gets away with it she s really sharp huh but how the hell could anybody ever figure that out why would anyone bother after all only one reporter is even interested i give this move a it was so dumb i just had to keep watching and it only got dumber that s the real spoiler but even though i ve told you you ve got to see it to believe it
genie zoe trilling arrives in egypt to visit her hypocritical bible quoting archeologist father william finley and attracts the attention of a group of cultists led by a descendant of the marquis de sade robert englund englund also plays de sade in flashbacks ranting in his cell genie is led astray by mohammed juliano merr who rides around naked on a horse and sabina alona kamhi a bisexual who introduces her to opium smoking which leads to a wild hallucination featuring topless harem dancers a woman simulating oral sex on a snake an orgy and her father preaching in the background meanwhile black hooded cult members decapitate gouge out eyeballs and slit throats when genie is slipped drugs in her tea she imagines de sade hanging from a cross a gold painted woman in a leafy g string and herself bloody on a bed covered in snakes it s all because she s the reincarnation of de sade s lost love this typically sleazy harry alan towers production is redundant seedy and pretty senseless but the sets costumes cinematography and location work are all excellent and at least there s always something going on score out of
please even if you are in the worst of the moods refrain from watching this flick i don t think whether anything was right with this movie at all on a friend s recommendation i watched this and i literally flushed h and min of my life down the closet poor acting stupid direction weak storyline and pathetic action sequences and when you blend this together you get double impact even least of the expectations were not met i guess i did learn one thing never watch van damme action flicks they are pure wastage of time
this movie is bad news and i m really surprised at the level of big name talent who would ever agree to appear in such a piece of junk as this i imagine there were a few strangled agents sprawled across hollywood blvd as a result of this fiasco what really gets you is that it could have been good the directors star appeal and the subject matter was sufficient fodder to spark interest and ticket sales but this is a flop the multiple story lines all go from bad to silly by the pictures end and you end up feeling like a mouse in a maze looking for a piece of cheese that turns out to be rotten what spike is able to achieve is revenge against any italians who may have beat him up when he was a kid or insulted him as the movie does quite a number on perpetuating outdated and probably offensive italian stereotypes as with any spike lee film there is some really thought provoking and magical camerawork he does have the gift of grabbing your psyche and transporting you into his vision if only for a few memorable scenes but the question remains can you endure the other hours of head scratching and clock watching as you wonder and wait for the ending that has to be there somewhere
disappointing and irritating the screenwriter has no true understanding of human nature but instead strings together clich s in a disjointed fashion character is not explored in depth these are puppets plunked down in a plot he openly confesses needed a dramatic element the mother s affair with her daughter s lover anne reid gives an excellent performance in spite of being given some peculiar situations and lines such standing passively to allow her angry daughter to slug her in the eye the script portrays darren daniel craig as a dr jekyll mr hyde without any hints about why except that he snorts cocaine before the big scene a mature writer could have done so much more with this topic
journey to the center of the earth is the story of some tourists of hawaii three of them siblings and one of them a young british nanny babysitting a dog when the siblings accidentally drive off in their jeep with the basket of dog biscuits the nanny follows them it might ve just been safer to purchase more all the way to the cave the siblings intended to explore i guess for some reason they actually go in the cave and then when the place starts caving in they try to get out to no avail except for the six year old sister who they tell to go get help meanwhile the more they move around in the cave the more they continue to plummet further and further towards the earths cavernous core and behold it is here where they find the city of atlantis and its bizarre alien habitants who are living under the oppressive rule of one alien that doesn t want them asking to many questions about the worlds external to their own i see that rusty lemorande the named director of the film has provided comments on this film in which he explains that part of latter half of this film is actually the sequel to alien in l a well whatever it was it was an amazingly cheap movie that i would rank only slightly higher than city limits a sci fi film also made on a non existent budget because at the least ending of this dreadful piece of mostly incoherent film making that cuts corners where it can aims for some humor and amusement in the last minutes when we finally see what life is like in the alien world at the center of the earth i also give it a two star rating rather than one because it was at times funny even if only in its subtleties for example the aliens asks the british girl if she s an alien and she explains that the ministry should be sending her work visa shortly or when the alien girl finds bryan and explains that he is in the city of altantis and he mistakes this for atlantic city new jersey little things like that make the idiocy of the first hour or so tolerable imagine how great the film could ve been though if they had actually intended to make it and actually had money to make it i do like how in the end no one wonders what happened to the little sister who was sent away in the beginning to get help she d just be wandering around the hawaiian caves and not too far from the erupting volcano mind you
this is without doubt one of the worst films i ve ever seen the plot is so full of holes the story is like a bad remake of a bad suspense movie and the actors sound like were reading directly from the manuscript for the first time worst of all is steve guttenberg he plays his character like he was in police academy the same foolish womanizer and that s not suited for a leading man in what should have been a thriller it s really hard to believe that hanson would make l a confidential ten years later avoid this like the plague
flight of fury is a shockingly dire but worst of all boring action film i don t expect a lot from a seagal film all i expect is to be moderately entertained for or so minutes with some mindless action unfortunately this doesn t even achieve that low expectation the action scenes are few and far between the plot which is totally irrelevant in these films is needlessly complicated and confusing with huge plot holes throughout the acting is truly abysmal bordering on embarrassing with seagal and his whispering one expression performance being the best among the sorry lot of rd raters i find it hard to believe that anything close to m was spent on this dire mess unless m of that was seagal s salary i somehow doubt it the one moment of any interest to straight guys or gay girls is that out of seemingly nowhere two hot chicks end up in a lesbian sex scene of sorts complete with huge baps on display other than that it s mediocre stuff which is no different to many of the michael dudikoff b movies i ve endured
the movie has one nude scene a man sitting on the edge of the bed with his exposed genitals smack dab in the middle of the screen it is quite a long scene what was the point i almost think it was meant to be funny but we were watching it with my mother and it wasn t funny to have that staring at us for what seemed like a full minute the movie is cold none of the characters are even likeable audrey tatou is cute of course but her character is an unhappy girl i really would not recommend this movie i had expected it to be charming and fresh but it was depressing i wondered if the director was from a very upper crust educated french family and he looks down on these characters
i bought a set of dvds for bucks at my local suncoast which contained this movie and three other trashy horror flicks including its sequel witchcraft xi so basically i paid the rock bottom price of for this movie if you do the math i can t exactly say i was ripped off i have a thing for trashy horror movies but this is the kind of trash that gives trash a bad name the budget couldn t be over though it appears as if they spent a total of i know it s a low budget film but that s no excuse for totally uninspired camerawork the film blood cult though not very good was made for an extremely low budget and still had fairly good camerawork and acting the acting in this movie is the definition of effortless especially from that muscular guy with the texas accent everyone is pretty much reading their lines off the page you can take that figuratively or literally i wouldn t be surprised if the script was off camera as they were performing i said before that i ve never seen a bad english actor this movie has quite a few bad ones and though english movies aren t always good they always seem to have at least a level of sophistication which is why i don t see why any englishman or englishwoman would volunteer to do a home video style schlock flick like this did merchant ivory put a hold on their casting calls usually i think people are too hard on directors and actors even some of the worst movies in hollywood have some level of professionalism in the directing acting and cinematography departments even when you watch a movie like glitter you can t honestly say it looks like a third grader shot those scenes though a third grader could ve written the script i ve seen home movies that are shot better than witchcraft x and that s no exaggeration whatsoever even the gore is minimal since the filmmakers only had money to buy some fake blood on sale at party city not a single effort was put into making this movie let s just sum it up like that you get the picture there s a good deal of nudity though that doesn t save it however i must say that girl with the red orange hair who s either naked or wearing a cleavage popping outfit throughout the film is really hot my score out of
for years after world war the united states was in a state where key segments of the economy were dominated by military interests at the same time because of the draft and wars everyone in society had served or was connected to someone who had this allowed for a minigenre based on the notion of american cleverness in the midst of an inflexible military machine sometimes that machine was non us military for example in prisoner of war situations once removed are stories in other machines science fiction and corporate but they always reference this military genre and indeed the testosterone shots of action even reference their comic sibling you can trace it i think perhaps starting in the comic meaning amrican sections of the great escape which immediately spawned teevee offspring in gomer pyle and hogan s heros then a second wave triggered by catch and mash both of which had been real life then books then movies and in the mash case then teevee but before all that there was the phil silvers show about a sergeant bilko and this followed from mister roberts a happy con man who only committed harmless crimes and then only as response to an overly crude system which attempted to limit his life this was in the day when teevee shows mattered you absorbed them instead of merely carrying them to work to chatter about it wasn t particularly clever in any way except in finding that crack between what we wanted in control and freedom its one large zone where americans worked out how they think about forgivable even endearing lies in a military context a zone that has been appropriated by one of our political parties here because its big it sometimes pays off in laughs stripes was pretty darn funny i thought it had the twist of the misfits actually defeating serious foes sort of folding in some dirty dozen and sexual adventure now this well before the cultural wars escalated it tries to touch that sweet spot like other remakes that manhandled steve martin it is so unfunny you actually root for the army to be the stronger player yet another way to track how societies work out the handles on military power ted s evaluation of you can find something better to do with this part of your life
i found the pace to be glacial and the original story blown way out of proportion to the content my wife slept through most of it and i did not try to wake her because i felt she was not missing anything when holmes and watson enter the house and then are potentially caught it is unclear how they could hide all of their entry and burglary tools so quickly it is also unclear how the door to the study is locked preventing the servants from getting in the thing that puzzled me was right at the end when there was a glint in the eye of the broken statute i have no clue what this was supposed to represent
this is one of the worst films i ve ever seen i looked into it mainly out of a morbid curiosity since i loved the novel and i wish i hadn t i turned it off after a little less than an hour though i wanted to turn it off after five minutes i wish i had it disregards the novel a lot and changes all sorts of factors unless the film managed to redeem itself in the last or so minutes which would be impossible i would in no way recommend this its an insult to one of the greatest writers of the th century i don t think as many people say that it is that the bell jar is necessarily unfilmable but this particular rendition could have been done without i d almost like to see this one day in the hands of a director and screenwriter who can do it justice
how can you tell that a horror movie is terrible when you can t stop laughing about it of course the plot has been well covered by other reviewers so i ll just add a few things on the hilarity of it all some reviews have placed the location in south america others in africa i thought it was in some random island in the pacific where exactly does this take place seems to be a mystery the cannibal tribe is conformed by a couple of black women some black men and a man who looks like a young frank zappa banging the drums the devil god is a large black man with a terrible case of pink eyes one of the freakiest moments in the film is when pablito find his partner hanging from a tree covered in what seems to be an orange substance that i assume is blood starts screaming for minutes on and on that s actually funny and then the head of his partner falls in the ground and pablito kicks it a bit for what i assume is shits n giggles and the eyes actually move but of course then the freak is gone when you realize the eyes moved because the movie is just bad i hadn t laughed like this in a loooong while and i definitely recommend this film for a sunday afternoon with your friends and you have nothing to do grab a case of beers and start watching this film you ll love it if you are looking for a real horror or gore movie though don t bother
what reviewers and mst k left out is the best part and only memorable scene of this otherwise dreadful movie there is a very good rape in the shower scene committed by the bad guy ben gazzara look alike on maria as mentioned killed later through t j s ineptitude perhaps rape is too strong a word prison mating ritual may be more appropriate the background behind this chance yet forced meeting is the mobster who is hiding ben gazzara introduces him to the girls hanging out at his pool the ish blonde disses him but our villain must be quite smitten by her because the courtship is on at that point his first move is to attempt drowning her until his mafia don benefactor tells him to knock it off kind of like the girl in high school you didn t like but still wanted to have carnal knowledge of anyway let s just say he catches up with her in the cabana later
what why are people saying this is mind blowing just face it the ending is on of the worst endings in the history of cinematography left and the whole world has ended not to mention the character was a idiot the whole time he got everyone killed was right the whole time if he sacrificed then non of this would have happened people giving there lives for a stupid cause and for what to make it rain i admit the movie had it s parts and the whole concept was fascinating but a lot of it was clich s one after another and did anybody else get this feeling that this is a lot like lord of the rings characters died for stupid reasons there was almost no character development and honestly ask yourself is it good to have only four guys left in the world its pointless and stupid it was one of the shortest movies i ve ever seen and thank god how is robots turning against humans creative in any way it s been done like a hundred times this movie is really stupid go see a movie that s worth watching like star trek the hangover or inglorious basterds those were good movies
i was looking for a cute simple comedy to pass the time but choosing this film proved to be an enormous mistake i can t write a single good thing about it first the script is stupid and not funny at all relying on tired recycled jokes and a farting turtle for laughs in my book that s not funny that s pathetic low budget effects if i can even call them effects with horrible cinematography in many places it feels almost like an indie film shot with no money acting i feel sorry for the actors are pamela anderson and denise richards that desperate for some money that they ve agreed to take part in this looking at their recent filmography it would appear so despite the outfits pamela is showing her age and as a whole they don t even come across as sexy let alone funny this movie is not even in the so bad it is funny category it s just bad as if everybody involved was sick of it avoid
this is a truly terrible film i m only writing this so that some people somewhere are put off watching it if i have stopped one person from wasting some of their precious life watching this film i shall die happy unutterably dull although since it stars al pacino i was fooled into thinking that at any moment something interesting was going to happen then the credits rolled and i realised i had been completely fooled into watching this unbelievable drivel i cannot believe that this film has achieved as high a score as it has at imdb over stars when i last saw the voting are you people voting ironically please please please do not watch this film
i mean seriously what group would sing about a crazy car so what if their ten it s way too immature for a little kid to sing about being my women i mean seriously the name is pretty corny too naked brothers just because they take off their pants how creative i don t get why they need a tv show i mean most artist don t really need a tv show about themselves especially the naked brothers band heck how many of them are in the freaking group and seriously whats with the movie jeez nick use to be the hightlight of my years growing up but seriously the naked brother band so many parents would not let their kids watch this especially with the name the naked brother s band its a stupid uncreative show that should not be aired onto tv
recently i had opportunity to view a working print in kansas city olathe ks of this title it is difficult for me being a lover of the art as i am to report the following but the truth sometimes hurts and quite frankly after sitting through this tripe i m using the slang definition here worthless statements or writing for an hour and a half i feel obligated to share warn any interested parties let s begin at the beginning a good place to start as always the first minutes are not really that bad a couple of laughs and decent development but then it is downhill from there this is the story of a woman in her mid thirties that as the writer would like for you to believe is dissatisfied with her life and unfulfilled the first major difficulty occurs when if you don t know that fact going into the movie you won t know it when she suddenly risks it all for in my opinion a very unkempt and unlikely fling with a local salesman there is little development drastically insufficient development to justify her actions for the affair she has and when it occurs one feels as i did that she is just of low moral character the word slut comes to mind hopefully they ll let that pass the review and post the comment this in my opinion is the first fatal flaw of the film if you re married or have ever been in love irregardless of whether you are male or female its going to turn you off quite frankly i feel that it would have made a much better blue movie that s the level in my opinion of which the screenplay is deserving the second fatal flaw is the casting diane lane just didn t work for me here and viggo mortensen is not the right man for the job believe me the only saving grace to the entire film is anna paquin the depth of her ability as a fine actress shines in places conveying a subtle yet very blunt i apologize for the dichotomy but it is accurate portrayal of an emerging teen bravo well done i m not going to give the ending away but i was disappointed being billed as a slice of life romance is one thing but an ending like that well if that teased you enough to see this picture don t say i didn t warn you but you better look fast if this celluloid is released i doubt it goes four weeks before bursting into flames i d say wait for the video but the free sex education tapes at most video rental outlets have more entertainment value hmmm dustin hoffman produced this you think he d learn after ishtar this film once carried the working title blouse man and should have been left on the rack if you ve never in your life wanted to walk out on a film give this one minutes the only thing worth staying for is anna paquin if you can stomach the fact that you ll find your mind drifting to whether or not you took out the garbage before you left home which is probably where you should have stayed in the first place if you re off to the movies to see this one that s my two cents for what it is worth
as an avid fan of the flashman books by george mcdonald fraser i looked forward immensely to seeing flashy on the big screen when this film was first released sadly it was a huge disappointment then so i left it alone for years before going back to watch it again but it was no better the second time mr fraser is a tremendously skillful writer but i am not a fan of his film screenplay work with richard lester the penchant for slapstick spoilt the three musketeers for me and the same applies here to me the whole tone and feel of the film is wrong the flashman books are uproariously funny in parts but they are adventure novels there is much seriousness in the way the adventures that flashman has after all he is involved in dangerous situations this is conveyed in the novels but not conveyed at all on film due to the its comedic style it is a tremendous shame as it could have a great film had it been a more faithful adaptation of the style of the book when i first read that the book was to be filmed the article said that the film was to star oliver reed i rejoiced as reed to me was the epitome of flashman how i would have loved to see him in the role malcolm mcdowell is a good actor but does not fit the visual image of flashman created by the books too scrawny looking flashman is supposed to be a big strapping fellow neverheless reed was excellent as bismarck what kills the film is that it is made as a comedy the only scene in which it creates the true atmosphere of the book is the scene in which flashman kills de gautet tom bell a great shame as the production values costumes sets etc are superb and the casting is generally excellent just about everybody in the film is well cast apart from malcolm mcdowell possibly the directorship of richard lester was responsible for the way the film is as a recent radio adaptation of flash for freedom adapted by mr fraser worked quite well perhaps one day we may see flashman done justice on screen
watching this i mainly noticed the ad placements dhl aquawhite strips rockstar and more it s one product placement after another it s quite obvious how this movie got its funding jessica simpson s acting is laughable any dick shouldn t ever get work because he plays the same lame character the story is just a backdrop for this very long commercial i can t believe this movie was even considered for theatrical release the longer you watch this movie the more you re embarrassed for everyone involved the only minor saving grace is larry miller and rachael lee cook who gets almost no screen time as jessica s cousin i m embarrassed i watched the whole thing i would recommend avoiding this one
how this film could miss so many of the fascinating complex and mysterious aspects of the original story or the original movie is truly remarkable an unbelievably thin and unengaging plot ankle deep characterisation motivation and a really awful soundtrack replacing tension with vast swathes of noise replacing the arcane musical references of the original for digitised crashes and roars then there are the specific references to the original which are merely plastered on over the cracks dreadful in a world where gormless brain dead amerikan remakes of the italian job a tear appears get carter sobs uncontrollably and alfie have desecrated our screens recently this one takes the proverbial biscuit execrable nonsense how ellen burstyn ever got involved is a wonder rubbish
it s common practice for a film about repression to be somewhat muted in style and tone there s a difference however between using restraint and encouraging narcolepsy among audience members in the secret lives of dentists starring campbell scott and hope davis director alan rudolph plays as close to the vest as possible with the result being a film that never amounts to much beyond a rumination on how teeth are a metaphor for married life scott gives a fine performance in the role of david hurst a dentist married to another dentist davis rudolph sets up the dynamic of their relationship quickly he is completely absorbed in the day to day duties of being the parenthood she is quietly disillusioned with their frantic family life and then ratchets up the tension when scott may or may not witness his wife with another man from this point on the film focuses on whether or not david is going to confront his wife dana about her possible adultery or whether she will beat him to the punch and leave for good from time to time david is treated to visits from an imaginary friend in the form of a former patient played by denis leary borrowing heavily from brad pitt s tyler durden in fight club while there is enough uncertainty about dana s infidelity and david s instability to warrant examination the last two thirds of the film are embarrassingly empty of theme or narrative instead rudolph creates drama out of a nasty fever that travels slowly through the hurst family culminating in a pointless hospital visit at the film s climax the film never picks up on the hints at what david is really capable of if he wasn t so dedicated to his family neither does it spend much time looking at dana s precarious balancing act between her family life and her other more fulfilling ambitions by choosing to spend the majority of the film worrying over a fever gone awry rudolph kills the momentum of his film by the time the fifth member of the family shows up sweating and sickly the film has used up all the good graces of scott s well measured performance david and dana end up retracing their steps over and over again until a less than cathartic finale with nothing to build on over the last hour the conclusion seems awkward and patched on the secret lives of dentists takes a common theme and does nothing to improve upon it altogether a disappointing unimaginative film
i really hate this show i had watched one episode and i knew this show is really terrible the story lines are both poorly written and executed and the jokes are really bad i mean it is just a sh ty rip off of dexter s laboratory and johnny quest bout an obnoxious boy with flamed blond hair with his twin genius sisters and talking dog a stay at home dad and a smart super busy mom like oh my flippin god their dad is a mother f kin crazy home maker isn t that so gay if my dad is a home maker i would personally die of shame that is really i would i have nothing else to about this this travesty but only word count them words to describe it lame stupid and above all f k up that s all i could say folks it is definitely making my list of worst animated series ev er if i had one that is
this was a complete disappointment the acting isn t bad but the production was just so bad that at times i felt i needed to stop it but i sadly made it through and was able to finish it a bit embarrassed by the whole poor movie it is o k if you are o k with cheesy moral plots and don t mind watching a movie that vastly misconstrues whitman if you want a cheesy fictional story go for it
director jonathan lynn has made some underrated comedies in the past like greedy and clue this isn t one of them more akin to a police academy film than its inspiration it stars steve martin in the old phil silvers role as an army sergeant forever pulling scams under the nose of his superiors but the idyllic life of bilko and his lazy platoon looks shaky when an old enemy visits the base determined to catch bilko in the act nothing much happens really it s all quite dull it s not very funny martin dan aykroyd and phil hartman squeeze a couple of laughs out through sheer effort but they re all better than this and it s quite painful watching them work with such thin material
what a pathetic movie i won t waste much time commenting about it i m still trying to get back the couple hours i wasted on it let me leave it simply with shaq has no business being an actor or singer he is utterly without talent at both discplines it s a crying shame that substantially more talented people waste away in community theatres and karaoke bars while shaq uses his name as a basketball player to undeservedly get cast in movies and cut cds much of the failure of this movie was the pathetic no talent that is shaq

holy crap this was the worst film i have seen in a long time all the performances are fine but there is no plot really no plot a bunch of clowns talk about this and that and that s your film ug robert duvall s character is senile and keeps asking the same people the same qestions over and over this earns him the same responses over and over i am pretty sure this film got upto a six because people think they should like it good performances with famous and well regarded actors but the actual complete work is a steamy turd well maybe that s a bit deceptive since steam rising from a fresh pile sounds a little like something happening and in this film nothing happens sack
based on tom wolfe s satirical novel that was praised by all i have not read it yet tom hanks stars as a wall streeter who accidentally kills a black boy while lost in a bad part of nyc willis stars as the reporter who starts hanks on his downward spiral the characters are very thin and there seems to be no empathy for anyone in this movie and for a comedy or a satire there arent a lot of laughs either melanie griffith had her breasts done during filming so a fun thing to do is to see if her boobs change size during different parts of the film this will keep your mind off other things like the lack of script or humor on a scale of one to ten
the only reason i am bothering to comment on this movie is to save you all minutes of your life and maybe your money i bought it ex rental for it looked interesting so i took a chance within minutes of turning it on i realised i d made a mistake the entire cast should be stored away until winter and then thrown on the nearest log fire where they could meet more of their kind as for the devin hamilton writer and director he should just be shot sadly this should have been done before he made this rubbish avoid this film if you see it in the shops run away
oliver hardy awakens with a hangover and soon learns that his uncle is coming to see ollie s new wife and baby the problem is they don t exist ollie apparently made them up so it s up to him and his pal to locate a lady with a baby who will agree to pose as his family this isn t a particularly unique story idea as i ve seen at least a couple other silent shorts with this exact plot the best of these was bobby vernon s don t kid me it is much better than one too many probably much of this was due to it being made a decade later when comedy became a bit more sophisticated and relied less on pointless slapstick now i am not against physical comedy but in some slapstick films people starting shooting guns wildly kick and strangle each other etc with little provocation sadly at the end of one too many that s exactly what they do none of it makes sense and it was as if they d just run out of story ideas overall not exactly a milestone in entertainment there s just not enough payoff to merit watching it unless you are an obsessive silent fan like myself
this movie tries hard but completely lacks the fun of the s tv series that i am sure people do remember with fondness although i am i watched some of the series on youtube a long time ago and it was enjoyable and fun sadly this movie does little justice to the series the special effects are rather substandard and this wasn t helped by the flat camera work the script also was dull and lacked any sense of wonder and humour other films with under par scripting are home alone cat in the hat thomas and the magic railroad and addams family reunion now i will say i liked the idea of the story but unfortunately it was badly executed and ran out of steam far too early and i am honestly not sure for this reason this is something for the family to enjoy and i was annoyed by the talking suit despite spirited voice work from wayne knight but the thing that angered me most about this movie was that it wasted the talents of christopher lloyd jeff daniels and daryl hannah all very talented actors jeff daniels has pulled off some good performances before but he didn t seem to have a clue what he was supposed to be doing and elizabeth hurley s character sadly came across as useless daryl hannah is a lovely actress and generally ignored and i liked the idea of her being the love interest but sadly you see very little of her not to mention the monster attack is likely to scare children than enthrall them likewise with wallace shawn as some kind of government operative christopher lloyd acquits himself better and as an actor i like lloyd a lot he was in two of my favourite films clue and who framed roger rabbit and i am fond of back to the future but he was given little to work with and had a tendency to overact quite wildly overall as much i wanted to like this movie i was left unimpressed instead of being fun it came across as pointless and that is a shame because it had a lot of potential with some talented actors and a good idea but wasted with poor execution bethany cox
a terrible movie containing a bevy of d list canadian actors who seem so self conscious about the fact they are on camera that their performances are overly melodramatic and quite forgettable this film is badly written badly edited and badly directed it is disjointed incomprehensible and bizarre but not in a good way mcdowell does a great job with what he is given but is the only one in this film to do so he really has a bad story and script to work with it s not even camp enough to be funny i have yet to see van pelleske act in a credible manner and even the sub characters like eisen with his nasal whiny voice confirm that we are on a lot in toronto rather than on a barge off africa didn t the director see that the creature looks like a jazz dancer in an alien suit the fight between the blue bolts of lightning and pelleske s orange wisps of magic for lack of a better word is obviously the result of bad actors with no choreographer overlaid with completely derivative special effects was there even a director on set or in the editing room for this disaster film not the good kind learn from the mistakes of others don t even waste your time with this one you ll regret it like i did i have nothing more to say about this waste of celluloid
shame shame shame on ua dw for what you do i was appalled do not take kids to see this movie the humor is totally inappropriate for children plus they ll be bored and disappointed certainly we all have read theo s wonderful children book and certainly we have expectations but this is pure trash dr seuss would be ashamed and certainly would ve never given his thumbs up at such a dastardly attempt to capitalize on a classic what a pity spend your money on the book if you own a copy then buy the book and donate it to a toys for tots program this movie is not worth a free ticket viewing stick with the book the tv cartoon version works well if you want a visual portrayal save your money seriously save your money it will be on cable by saint patty s day shame shame shame on what they do
for the big thinkers among us the intruder is a maddeningly incoherent movie from france that gives so called art films a bad name the story is something about a bitter old coot louis trebor michel subor who goes searching in tahiti for a heart transplant but beyond that i have no idea who any of the people in the movie were or why they were doing what they were doing with no coherent storyline to boast of the movie loses us early on though i m perfectly willing to admit that there might be somebody out there who actually gets some deep message out of this film this muddled snail paced drama runs a full two hours and five minutes though i seriously doubt anyone with any kind of a life will still be hanging around by the closing credits
as an ordinary movie watcher i can t say i enjoyed watching this one it s not too emotional for a drama not too gripping for a thriller not too fast for an action plus some moments of the movie are hardly credible ok i understand soldiers become a bit out of their mind out there but it s hard to believe that a person would risk his life carjack into the middle of a hostile city and after being shouted at by a professor s wife run away without having asked a question in a proper way it would seem terribly romantic if it were an animation or so but it s supposed to be a serious film about war there are several episodes like this so the whole picture makes an impression that it s just a raw preview of a movie and it needs considerable work it feels like the movie makers wanted to create an image of an emotional brave soldier but all these curves of his psychology seem simply unnatural this picture left a question in my head why why they gave it an oscar why six and imho it s the most thrilling part of the movie
and i actually gave it a zero on my personal scale i have been attending movies since and have seen well over in the theater i don t rate movies that i see only on tv this is the only movie i have ever rated zero my wife and i took our four children then aged and and even the kids thought it was terrible in fact it was my daughter now who alerted me to this site amazed that the movie was getting an overall rating of the animation of the dinosaurs looked amateurish at the time and is even worse in retrospect the acting particularly by sean young is atrocious and the story line is simply silly
a film so insecure the creaters perhaps hoped to milk an original film noir classic title farewell my lovely thinking the gullible would assume it a remake the characters are so foul and unappealing that it deserved its cold reception when first released time only adds to it its absurdity having none of the guile cinematography desperation or despair of classic noir it relied instead on a convoluted and senseless crime plot that would have easily resulted in several arrests within hours as if that weren t enough it threw in an utterly sexless attempt at erotica in which at least one of the participants hadn t bothered to bathe in several days this only made this mess all the more painful to watch find a good classic forties or fifties film noir instead of wasting two hours on this failure
very low budget police procedural film about homicide detectives trying to solve the murder of a woman whose body turns up in a stolen car in central park and their only clue is a tattoo on her arm although released by rko this has the look of an independent production that was picked up by the studio for distribution the cast and crew with a few exceptions among them a young and uncredited jack lord director edward montagne and cameraman william steiner are comprised of complete unknowns and it shows the performances are universally sub par and wouldn t pass muster in a high school training film the direction is stodgy and choppy and as mentioned previously there s no chemistry whatsoever between the lead actors however despite the film s many shortcomings it does have a few good points the location shooting in new york city and the film s ultra low budget gives it a gritty authenticity much like that of the far superior the naked city a shootout in a dark basement is decently handled and some of the investigating procedures are clever otherwise it s not much to write home about it is worth a look however for a glimpse at the seamier sections of new york city in the early s and old car buffs will be ecstatic to see the legions of s and s cars in the streets
okay first of all i didn t sit down to watch the premier of a star trek series to see a cowboy flying around in space this is how a normal enterprise episode works archer finds a nebula or something aloung the lines of that and wants to take a closer look but it might destroy the ship he sends a shuttle into the nebula and and the shuttle get damaged in all of the episodes i have seen all of the problems are happening because of archer s stupid mistakes oh and did you see the preview of one episode showing archer and t pol kissing i was planning to watch that episode but after that i totally gave up on enterprise and turned to tv right off come on this is star trek also what was with the banana slug in one episode hoshi had a banana slug but had to leave it behind for some stupid reason okay fine little dumb to bring you pet slug in space but whatever okay that was what i thought until they left it on a desert planet a banana slug cannot leave in a desert how dumb are these writersany ways just saying if enterprise is on don t watch it
a doctor who is trying to complete the medical dream of transplantation is experimenting secretly on corpses from the hospital with varying success his final best chance comes when he lovingly wraps his girlfriend s head in his jacket as he rescues it from a burning vehicle i was looking for cheese and with this premise i believed i found it it has everything everything that bad movie hunters look for chest and brain surgery with the surgeons leaving with pristine white scrubs unique camera angles i always love watching the rear passenger wheels of cars cheesy clarinet stripper music and one of the longest death scenes in movie history but unfortunately these so bad they are good moments can t overcome the too bad they stink stretches jan in the pan annoyed me with her droning monologues in a hoarse whisper the somewhat less than evil laughter and the fact she was kept alive with some columbian home brew coffee and dd batteries i couldn t even entertain myself with dr bill s horrid overacting and moral self righteousness usually such ham makes these movies a must see in my opinion in this case i was bored with it the best part of the movie in my opinion was the s version of body shopping and i even found myself nodding off during that don t spend money on this one there are better bad movies out there to entertain your sick sense of humor
i don t think i m too far off base saying that this is possibly the worst movie i ve ever seen i ve been working on a list of my favorite war movies the longest day to hell and back bridge on the river kwai all black and white which all have good plots rich characters and great acting i ve seen better dialog and acting in student written high school one act plays the plot however isn t a bad premise just poorly implemented it s kind of like a traffic accident though i couldn t seem to turn it off a movie doesn t need big money or great sets i e twelve angry men and lifeboat to be good so budget is no excuse what were they thinking
falsely accused skirt chasing chums john wayne as john scott and eddy chandler as kansas charlie change identities to become alias smith and jones mr wayne becomes john jones mr chandler s is supposed to be rev smith but wayne calls him dr smith at no time are either of them as entertaining as roger davis pete duel jonathan harris or ben murphy although wayne can be considered infinitely more successful than any of them career wise pretty blonde mary kornman as anne grown up from her days in our gang is a lovely interest for wayne she and chandler have a couple of cute scenes with wayne if you re not a fan of low budget john wayne films of the s this movie won t make you one
the cast is ok the script is awkward at times and it takes a while to figure out what the point of the movie is i found myself looking forward to doing the dishes the shehan bit is a cheesy statement on the war i guess we were supposed to not notice it we did its a house you did nothing more than kill forty five minutes the shower part huh what was that about literally it is i have a client ok you can use our shower yawn the angles are trying way to hard there was a set of woods suddenly its gone cause you can see right through then next it is deep and animals are dying in the end this is a horrendous movie of boring proportions
spoilers included with a title like bleed you know the creative juices weren t running on high when this puppy was conceived the movie is your basic run of the mill low budget slasher movie oh sure it tries to be creative with the premise of the murder club but we learn that was just a joke anyways okay for those who really care about these things the basic plot is that new girl in town starts dating her co worker he invites her into his circle of friends and at a party they tell her how they have a murder club and they murder people blah blah blah well we learn that it was all a joke but not before our heroine kills a lady in a parking garage now the members of the murder club are being killed one by one oh and the bad guys wins and the movie ends on a downer by that time you won t really care though in retrospect the first or so minutes of this movie make no sense the motivation for the killings in the beginning of the movie is never explained i would say that it was a way for the director to pad out the film but on the dvd there are deleted scenes i m not sure why anyone would want to see more than the feature length version of bleed but apparently the people behind the dvd thought the viewers would be clamoring for more on the box it says there are easter eggs but why the hell i would want to waste my time looking for extras on this movie is beyond me i was expecting a bad movie and bleed delivered on that front it wasn t a fun bad movie though everyone looks good in the movie and there s plenty of nudity but the acting is just awful my least favorite character is the guy who ends up being the killer i think he s supposed to be funny and amusing but he just ends up coming off as a tool i think the funniest moment of the movie is when our heroine kills the lady in the parking garage in a hilariously unconvincing death heroine shoves the women into the parking garage cement pole and the woman looks like she barely hits the thing and she spits out a mouthful of blood and dies for those who think that movie making is an intricate creative process done by professionals check out bleed it will change your mind and you ll realize any hack get can a movie made otherwise don t waste your time or money on this
this superior inferiority to the original dumb blind dead movie is another trash bin waste so many people have hyped up these films that i can t believe what they say about it since i was a kid i have heard about how scary and great these films are and i saw them all and was throughly disappointed was everyone on drugs from the s or do they just not know how boring this crude is
i m surprised about the many female voters who even give this film better marks my thought about this film was that the target audience is adult and male whipped and tortured women merciless revenge and a high body count are typical ingredients introduced into film history by the spaghetti subgenre the opening and the hand smashing are django rip offs the shooter however lacks the style of e g django score acting and cinematography are mediocre at best but if you look for the above mentioned ingredients you are in the right place here and the actors don t have an italian accent
this film is terrible the characters are completely unbelievable and wildly inconsistent the plot is awful and some of the classroom scenes are cringe worthy and make for uncomfortable viewing in fact the quality of the script and characterisation would suggest that this film was written by high school students only the utter lack of credibility to the school environment would suggest that in fact the writers probably never went to high school the acting in most cases was weak too although a lot of this was down to a poor script and plot i am not sure that any actors could have made this film watchable having said that the sound track was ok and the cinematography was nice in places although the editing was poor
i understand this movie was made on a very low budget but that is no excuse for the monstrosity that is grendel deathstalker the throne of fire barbarian queen conquest the invincible barbarian were all done on shoestring budgets and poor special effects yet they still managed to create cult classics by adding some scantily clad women warriors and a good sense of humor the primitive costumes dark castles and beautiful bulgarian landscape gave grendel the potential to be a very good low budget sword and sorcery film but the makers completely ruined this opportunity by using extremely poor cgi effects and colorless characters compare this film to beowulf it may not be citizen kane but it is a good example of how an entertaining low budget sci fi adventure movie can be made by using credible special effects and appealing characters
wow it s ironic since this movie has been out for awhile i think that someone else just reviewed it a couple days ago anyways i watched this movie simply because it has nick stahl for the record the movie was ridiculous the characters drove me insane they were so clich and stereotyped this movie had some of the worst dialogue i have ever heard it had way too many plot twists too there is one scene in the movie worth seeing however the scene warm heart cold gun where nick stahl kills the obnoxious girl in the shower well actually they were all obnoxious but his acting in that scene was excellent the look on his face it reminded my of american psycho a good movie the scene is worth seeing but not worth seeing the rest of the movie for do yourself a favor and don t watch it
robert deniro plays the most unbelievably intelligent illiterate of all time this movie is so wasteful of talent it is truly disgusting the script is unbelievable the dialog is unbelievable jane fonda s character is a caricature of herself and not a funny one the movie moves at a snail s pace is photographed in an ill advised manner and is insufferably preachy it also plugs in every cliche in the book swoozie kurtz is excellent in a supporting role but so what equally annoying is this new imdb rule of requiring ten lines for every review when a movie is this worthless it doesn t require ten lines of text to let other readers know that it is a waste of time and tape avoid this movie
this review also contains a spoiler of the first movie so if you haven t seen either movie and want to but don t want the spoilers please don t read this review while this movie is supposed to be about christian and kathryn meeting for the first time the movie is a poor copy of the first cruel intentions the actors that they had portray ryan phillippe s christian and sarah michelle gellar s kathryn are very poor substitutes indeed neither can pull off the smarmy snooty rich kid attitude that the original actors did it s absolutely appalling that some of the dialog was verbatim not so much between christian and kathryn but if you listen closely enough you ll recognize it there are also inconsistencies in the plot if this were truly the first meeting of christian and kathryn then why is it that christian fell in love with a girl at the end of the movie he supposedly was supposed to be in love for the first time in the original movie with reese witherspoon s character also the tie in with the photography you could be a model comment at the end was totally lame and didn t add anything at all overall this movie was a waste of time i can t believe they made a cruel intentions
when i rented this i was hoping for what reign of fire did not deliver a clash between modern technology and mythic beasts instead i got a standard monster hunts stupid people in remote building flick with bad script bad music bad effects bad plot bad acting bad bad bad only reason why i did give it a was that in theory there could exist worse movies in theory
nothing could have saved this movie not even superman ten years ago the special effects would have been amazing better directing might have gotten some more feeling and better performances out of the actors but nothing but feeding the script to a dragon could have fixed it plot holes bad lines terrible pacing endless replaying of the same shots of a cgi dragon stomping through hallways ugh avoid this one at all costs
okay this wasn t the worst movie i ve ever seen but i had heard lots of good things about it and i was sorely disappointed i could see where the film makers were coming from and that they were trying to express the fact that the two sides in this battle weren t a whole lot different from one another that the individuals were getting lost in the fighting etc etc well that s my presumption anyway at any rate the movie kind of bored me i ve watched a lot of really long movies but this one just seemed to drag on and on and on basically because i just couldn t bring myself to care for any of the characters i just kept thinking who cares i also found the acting to be rather dead pan and the dialogue strained i understand that this was the s and all but most of the conversations just seemed rather unnatural no one seemed to have any emotion throughout most of the film except during melodramatic events the romance in the story didn t seem to be supported by anything other than i m a guy and you re a girl which i don t consider much of a romance and yet i felt i was being steered to the belief that these people were in love oh well i guess it s the whole all this horror around us we have each other to cling to type thing or whatever i was also hoping for some sort of dynamic between the two best friends who both initially seemed to have an interest in the girl but that was just sort of dropped maybe avoiding a cliche love triangle i don t know oh well daniel holt was about the only character i really truly liked and sue lee was all right i didn t exactly dislike jake but he seemed a bit too spineless i guess jack bull i did not care for at all and i m pretty sure you re supposed to hate just about everyone else with the exception of the poor normal people who just get mowed down left and right it was pretty graphic and had that whole the horrors of war thing down but i ve seen plenty of other movies with the same theme done better i enjoyed the patriot a lot for instance even if it was a bit emotionally manipulative but as i ve already stated i m a cynic what can i say
first let s get it out of the way yeah this film steals a lot from darkness falls the plot for darkness falls goes something like this the tooth fairy a murderous woman who hides her face due to disfigurement kills people who look at her out of revenge in the tooth fairy the disfigured tooth fairy who yeah hides her face unleashes her furious vengeance on just about anyone a little too similar to be coincidence but what must be asked is this if you re going to directly steal the exact plot from a movie why choose something as mediocre as darkness falls sure it made a few bucks at the box office but that was strictly for the fairly okay theatrical experience the film delivered a low budget straight to video movie will not have that same effect and it didn t as i watched the opening minutes of the film my expectations actually rose there seemed to be at least some production value the story didn t seem terrible just blatantly ripped off past the first scene we get an okay cast of characters including an ex doctor with secrets played by that guy who looks like a busey and some hot veterinary student jenifer from argento s masters of horror jenifer after those few minutes however the film just slowly goes down the drain it serves all the basic horrible clich s including but not limited to some crazy old person with an unheeded warning the buff dumb jock the psychic and the stripper with the heart of gold one of the biggest problems this film had was its inability to stick with a target audience it s kind of like the filmmakers wanted to change the tone for whatever character was on screen at the time when the adults were on screen it had a more mature feel when star the stripper and whatshisface the jock were on screen the dialogue went down to a more stupid err immature level when the kid was on screen it felt like an episode of are you afraid of the dark only less scary technically the film is all over the place the visuals range from fairly good to plain boring the writing is subpar as is the acting for the most part on the plus side there s some excessive gore at parts including a fairly cool yet painfully predictable woodchipper scene and a pretty vicious nailgun scene also if you re looking for a bit of the sexy stuff there s a brief topless scene but if you want to see this chick topless there are better films to do that other than that there s not much to bother with when it comes to this film if you re a huge fan of darkness falls do those exist maybe you can check it out to see the story done in a different way but that s about the only reason i can find to see this one final verdict ap
the title of this obscure and almost righteously forgotten s slasher inevitably reminds me of the cure s mega smash monster hit song with the same title hence a piece of the lyrics in the title section of this user comment also i didn t have anything else to say that was useful anyway but hey the forest isn t totally hopeless and not even that bad actually if nothing else at least it obeys the admittedly unwritten first rule of s slasher kill someone within the first minutes of playtime sure you ve heard about the basic premise of this film a dozen times before but don t let that discourage you from watching it as the forest has a couple of things more to offer than just an appealingly sinister cover image it s actually a bit of an atypical s slasher the main characters aren t ordinary brainless teenagers and the script has solid ambitions towards supernaturalism the concept isn t always successful let alone plausible but it s more than interesting enough to hold your attention and there are even are a couple of surprisingly strong moments of tension and plot twists to enjoy two married couples decide to go camping in the most isolated woods of california but due to a stupid bet the wives travel separately from their husbands barely set up for the night they receive uncanny visits from a mother looking for her two children the children themselves and finally the father who s out hunting for human flesh the demented family may be real or imaginary but the women are definitely in danger and by the time their husbands arrive they have already vanished the men too encounter the family and they find out more about the slightly dysfunction background the forest is a weird and unusual film to say the least it s not exactly a masterpiece of plotting but the thoroughly strange atmosphere will certainly appeal to open minded fans of s horror the murders are fairly gruesome and will filmed including a slit throat and a painful saw massacre and the filming locations are stunningly beautiful the more you contemplate about the story and its abrupt twists the less it makes any sense so my advice would just be to enjoy this odd viewing experience for as long as it lasts and not a minute longer the acting performances are just above average the music is okay and at least director donald jones also responsible for the s exploitation sickie schoolgirls in chains tried to be a little more creative that the majority of s horror films too bad it ultimately fails
spoiler do not read this if you think about watching that movie although it would be a waste of time by the way the plot is so predictable that it does not make any difference if you read this or not anyway if you are wondering whether to see coyote ugly or not don t it s not worth either the money for the ticket or the vhs dvd a typical chick feel good flick one could say the plot itself is as shallow as it can be a ridiculous and uncritical version of the american dream the young good looking girl from a small town becoming a big success in new york the few desperate attempts of giving the movie any depth fail such as the tragic accident of the father the difficulties of violet s relationship with her boyfriend and so on mcnally director tries to arouse the audience s pity and sadness put does not have any chance to succeed in this attempt due to the bad script and the shallow acting especially piper perabo completely fails in convincing one of jersey s fear of singing in front of an audience the only good and quite funny thing about coyote ugly is john goodman who represents the small ray of hope of this movie i was very astonished that jerry bruckheimer produced this movie first gone in seconds and now this what happened to great movies like the rock and con air that was true bruckheimer stuff if you are looking for a superficial movie with good looking women just to have a relaxed evening you should better go and see charlie s angels it s much more funny entertaining and self ironic instead of this flick two thumbs down out of
well i m blowed a woody allen film that i walked out of after half an hour i m aware of the moral fragility of commenting on a film of which i ve seen less than half but i hope you ll understand why basically it became apparent very early on that we were going to be patronised from the screen with a script that set out its conceit as if with bullet points a cast that were all trying to be characters from hannah and her sisters with the exception of chloe sevigny and were badly directed into doing so and a camera that sat around portentously only for there to be nothing to film but chat and the actor delivering it drama none it s partially pre narrated but the action does nothing to develop a dramatic situation maybe i did leave too early in this case but by then i d decided against another hour and a half of one liner allen clones the script has its funny moments i went almost entirely on the back of will ferrell s excerpts in the trailer trailer hooked again doh but there s little pace to let them fly off nonchalantly as is best worse than this there s no fluidity saying this film s wooden makes a forest look like a jelly the opening caf bound discussion being the most abject case in point the only thing that should be done by numbers is potted reviewing
i did not enjoy the film joshua at all perhaps it is because i saw another much better similar film titled orphan days prior but perhaps it s really just because this film was not very good i am going with the ladder sure the plot of an evil child is not exactly original but that doesn t mean the film could not succeed it could have been suspenseful and entertaining and chilling but instead it was slow building boring uneventful and really didn t leave me thinking anything more than that wasn t very good when it was all over at the end joshua s motivations are revealed i won t give that away but the reality is that he didn t really accomplish his goals since despite vera farmiga as his mother abby disappearing about th through the movie all arrows point to her returning home soon she was committed to a mental institution because she was losing her mind but then joshua s father her husband was accused of tampering with her medication which tells the audience that the institution realized that she was indeed not mentally ill but rather was being dosed medically so shouldn t she be coming home soon won t joshua have failed won t his mother be living with him and his sister and possibly his father soon i question the father since his future is left open ended at the end of the day i didn t care about the characters the evil demon child joshua wasn t really scary the storyline moved slowly and when it picked up it was still boring suspense fell flat every single time when it was over i couldn t believe i had sat through the whole thing just because the acting was good from the parents especially vera farmiga as the mother but if you want to see a movie about an evil child go see orphan now that s a movie that took an unoriginal concept and created a brilliant movie
this movie is truly boring it was banned in chinese cinema and i can see why it s not because it s critical of the communist regime but simply because the movie is of such low quality i would never want to pay money to watch this i love movies from chen kaige and zhang yimou and i am disappointed such a poor movie could come out of china it totally seems to ignore the audience and the director seems to have made the movie for himself the shots of a person standing there doing nothing for up to a minute are hilarious and there s plenty of them the cinematography and video quality are unbelievably bad i looked this film up on the net and it seems like people actually like this film the only explanation i have for this is that some film buffs think that if a film is not in english it is automatically good i can t see any reason why people would like this this is not an art film it s of waste of celluloid that s if they actually shot it on film which they didn t
the writer director of this film obviously doesn t know anything about film i think the dp on this project was tied up and replaced with a monkey because every seen was either too dark or had the hotter hot spots than the sun the story was awful the characters were very one dimensional for someone to have said that this film was made for poker fans and not film fans that someone is kidding their self it was probably the writer director no poker fan in this world likes this movie even your money man hates this project to go into a casino and play a few hands doesn t give you the experience to write about poker keep your day job and if it s playing poker then you must be hurt n
i cannot get past the message of this movie it s laid out much too clearly to ignore and it is obscene because it has lost its sense of what it s about i haven t read the novel but pollack s film opens with a scene at a cia front organization in new york which is broken into by two professional assassins headed by max von sydow who proceed to brutally slaughter the half dozen quirky staff members we ve come to know and understand the staff include an elderly female receptionist a fussy elderly professorial guy who s toupee falls off when he is machine gunned is that a joke and last the beautiful tina chen who looks up from the copier realizes she is about to be murdered and says pitifully brave i won t scream von sydow replies sympathetically i know these murders are completely unexpected savage unmotivated by anything that we are aware of and graphic it is a brutal scene there is absolutely no way in which von sydow and his henchman can be redeemed and yet that is exactly what pollack tries to do towards the end after having killed these innocent good guys von sydow switches sides because the other side is willing to pay him and assassinates the evil mastermind behind a complicated intramural cia plot the script then turns him into a perfectly reasonable sensitive human being it is better to live in europe things are not so rushed or whatever i swear i m not making this up pollack wants us to believe that it is better to be an honest mass murderer than a crooked bureaucrat that s the message you should write it down in case you forget just exactly what kind of psychiatric shambles do you have to be in order to turn ordinary values not to mention common sense upside down like that i understand that there are thoughtful adults who dislike the government of the united states even hate it and who see conspiracies just about everywhere providing a knee jerk explanation for otherwise unexplainable events i know that people who think this way exist because i number some of them among my closer friends nevertheless at some point this dislike this hatred if it increases in intensity must pass beyond politics or ethics and into the realm of the psychiatric i don t for a moment believe that a man who murders people for money is better than a sinister government official i don t care how suave and cultured the murderer is or whether he knows how to reach the louvre on the metro whoever is purveying that message needs either medication or meditation i d like to be able to argue that the production is as thoroughly rotten as its message but i can t it s quite well done in some ways that s worse because it makes the film less dismissable even new york city looks photogenic on the screen and it s been a long time since i ve thought of new york as photogenic robert redford does an admirable job of projecting his character s initial shock and confusion but then turns into a telecommunicational semi genius and man he looks just fine his wardrobe is just right even his rimless glasses are becoming and his peacoat it s not everyone who can make a navy pea jacket look glamorous he seems extremely handsome too the swine i want to look like that i want to wear a denim shirt and a tie with such panache faye dunaway is alright in her role but it s not too believable a role would anybody eagerly sleep with a guy who has just kidnapped her and is holding her at gunpoint even if he did look like redford would anyone be emotionally wounded if when this ambivalent relationship is about to end redford asked her not to tell anybody about what happened cliff robertson is surprisingly good he does one or two extremely good double takes the mailman is superb the fight between him and redford in a crowded apartment is exquisitely choreographed and for once we really don t know for sure how it will turn out because redford a book reader after all seems mismatched against the brute cunning of this hired assassin this is one of john housemann s final roles a shame he s a magnet on screen and what an end to his life a friend finds him lost wandering the streets of new york in a neighborhood he d been familiar with for most of his life yes the movie is very well executed but i can t ignore that vicious paranoid message i have the same problem with leni riefenstahl s triumph of the will or her olympic documentary in which the announcer is watching a foot race in which jesse owens is pulling into the lead and says ominously this negro is dangerous
there is absolutely no reason to waste your time with this film the original said it all and still holds up either read the book or do some research about the story and you ll realize this remake is ludicrous eric roberts as perry smith his sister could have done a better job having been to holcomb edgerton ks where the story takes place the sets and locations looked nothing like kansas the original is riveting from the location filming to the use of the actual participants weapons and victims belongings unforgettable performances by scott wilson and robert blake soundtrack by quincy jones and cinematography by conrad hall the original is available on dvd in widescreen now let this turkey die a quick death
this movie was billed as a comedy and a mystery it fails badly at both the only mystery here is why would anybody make such a poorly constructed movie the only comedy is the laugh i got when i saw how high the readers here ranked it could there be two movies with the same name the movie i saw starred a girl with pretty blue eyes and a plot that wasn t there
i don t understand the positive comments made about this film it is cheap and nasty on all levels and i cannot understand how it ever got made cartoon characters abound sue s foul mouthed alcoholic layabout irish father being a prime example none of the characters are remotely sympathetic except briefly for sue s asian boyfriend but even he then turns out to be capable of domestic violence as desperately unattractive as they both are i ve no idea why either rita and or sue would throw themselves at a consummate creep like bob but given that they do why should i be expected to care what happens to them so many reviews keep carping on about how realistic it is if that is true it is a sad reflection on society but no reason to put it on film i didn t like the film at all
mona the vagabond lives on the fringes of french society in a life without meaning purpose or direction i watched this because of all the stellar reviews but i m afraid i must have missed something the character of mona has little or no personality while drifting through life being rude to people getting high and contributing nothing to anyone s life she s not interesting or exciting she s just useless i ve seen and known enough people like that there is no secret meaning to what they re doing they are just lazy bums i wouldn t want mona anywhere near me as she tends to steal anything that isn t nailed down and leave her friends in the lurch sure she s enigmatic because there isn t anything to her lots of junkies winos and bums i ve seen are enigmatic i wouldn t want to see a film about them either possibly there is something there that i totally missed otherwise i m assuming that all the reviews are from people who assume anything done by a french female director is high art
this contains spoilers i have rarely seen a film that is as unbelievable as this one is and being french it tries for depth by being enigmatic nothing really makes any sense l o is gay and has just announced at breakfast to his family that he is hiv positive the youngest brother marcel has not yet come down to breakfast and the first thing the family does is decide that at years of age he is too young to be told maybe if he was four or five but twelve the first totally unbelievable thing is that the family doesn t even ask where or how he got the virus how long he has known about it nothing is asked they only worry about marcel finding out this is a very close knit provincial family but although they decide not to let marcel know about l o s hiv positive status nor the fact of his being gay the rest of the family accepts all this news with absolutely no questions or reactions how many families do you know where the parents brothers wouldn t have at least some reaction to one of the members announcing that he is gay here nothing l o decides that he needs to go to paris to see his ex lover and he decides to go on the trip with of all people marcel do you know anyone who would bring his little brother along to go see a lover again totally unbelievable especially since marcel is not supposed to know either of his medical problems nor of his homosexuality if this is the way the family has decided to let him find out it is rather brutal and again unbelievable l o goes to find his lover aymeric at his work in a paris bar the owner says that aymeric will not be there until the early evening but why would l o want to see him at work why not phone and arrange to see him in some place more private where they can really talk why not go and see him at his home but no l o shows up later in the day with marcel in tow and is surprised when aymeric doesn t just drop everything to go walk with him for minutes aymeric tells him that he is no longer available that it was l o who left him and that l o hadn t replied to any of his letters l o says but i love you and then wanders off but if he really loved aymeric wouldn t he have at least told him about his hiv status to warn him to get tested and maybe get medication this would be the least he could do but not a peep he leaves and doesn t even warn aymeric that he might have contracted the aids virus this is totally irresponsible of him and of the film makers this film was apparently made for a french tv series for young people it is the perfect way to show kids how to be responsible well not here i guess every man for himself is still the french way of doing things another aspect of the film which was totally unbelievable was the touchy feely aspect everyone is always leaning against someone caressing someone or kissing someone inside the family and outside the family i have never seen anyone in france be this physical never mind an entire family seated at the breakfast table one year old brother has his leg perched on the lap of his elder brother and the elder brother is caressing his leg as everyone sits around discussing something how many brothers do you know who are that physically close in another scene the same year old comes into marcel s room asking what s the matter can t you sleep then takes off his clothes and completely naked gets into bed with his brother and snuggles up to him as if they were lovers this and another similar scene between l o and marcel gave a somewhat incestuous feel to the film sorry again i don t believe that this is regular behaviour between teenage brothers the only good thing i can say about the film is that the actors are all quite fine especially marcel in the main role but it wasn t really enough hiv and aids are far too serious to be presented in such a vague and irresponsible light at the end of the film the family has gone to the cemetery to bury l o but once again marcel has been left out of it he has been left in the care of a cousin i think nevertheless he sneaks out and watches the funeral from afar is this what such a close knit family would have done it is totally inconceivable that they would not have included him in his brother s funeral it was the last scene of the film and it was the last straw for this viewer
if you have beloved actors peter falk rip torn george segal and bill cobbs you don t need billy burke coolio or any other distractions massive talent is totally wasted in three days to vegas with the blame falling squarely on the script my neighbor s vacation films are about as interesting as this misguided road movie if you want to see how to utilize a veteran cast with a good script check out the crew there really are no redeeming factors here and watching these wonderful actors struggling with such weak material is a crime i wanted to like it but the shallow script cheats the audience by essentially giving the actors nothing to work with merk
ugh another one of those fooled by the cover dvds i expected some kind of action at least with bears cats such on the cover i got nothing bad movie i forced myself to watch this all the way through thinking that eventually something would happen no luck now the reason i gave this a is because of the scenery otherwise it sucked the kid was terrible talking to himself although i suppose they couldn t just run a movie with dumb music and no dialogue at all doing his lame karate stances to a tree stump threatening a raccoon munching on worms and what a dumbass kicking a porcupine and he wouldn t be pulling those quills out that easily either they stick like fishhooks at least he fought the bear weakly a couple of times what was up with the flashback thing it made a bad movie even worse i wanted to see a survival movie not some dramatic bs about a kid suffering thru divorce what else can i say well maybe they should have had the bear eat the kid or something at least that would have been more exciting people don t waste your time on this one
something that really does not go down right with al gore and his supporters s theory is the whole thing about concensus if there were such a consensus why is it that the believers in the almighty global warming feel the irrepressible need to try and bully anyone who questions them why is it that anyone who does not toe the line on global warming is met with smug accusations of being either stupid or on the payroll of the oil companies apparently being a professional global warming researcher does not mean you re on anyone s payroll in that wondrous world why is there such a need to tell everyone how the whole question is settled when it is the very nature of science to honestly question assumptions for some ideas on the answer to those questions read prey by the well know oil stooge michael crichton oh wait he is rich and not on the payroll of the oil companies he just took a huge career risk in not toeing the line of the greens and other kyoto worshippers and told the truth as he researched it by the way did you know that abiding to the kyoto protocol would result in almost no lowering of temperatures according to its own backers just a few questions that al gore made sure to stay away from lest he not get every penny of the environmental lobby in case he decides to run again so who s a stooge
welcome to our town welcome to your town as we are introduced into the worlds of its townsfolk of america this three act play is opened before us with the help of the stage manager a visual narrator if you like after his initial introductions we are lead into the homes of two particular families the webb s and the gibb s this is most definitely middle america at the turn of the century and the progressive way of life of the american dream and its saccharine overtones that can seem a little biased in this dream town here we see the everyday lives of some of its populace of grover s corners new hampshire even if there are too the migrant polish workers that add another to is numbers they never get a look in once the daily lives of these families have been introduced wives cooking children home working fathers working kids falling in love and the clean picket fences painted white the second act is started three years later after young george a young and unrecognisable william holden then aged and emily have fallen in love and intend to marry blossoming lovebirds reaching for the stars and reaching too a turning point in their own lives from the nest they lived and now into the anxieties and woes of young adulthood they nervously step the third act is slightly more sour and foreboding it is in this act that the movies intentions become apparent here we see not life not celebration but death and it is in this predicament that the dead as they return to revisit and reconcile their own life past are here to remind us to tell us that life and every last minute every precious breath is not to be wasted and squandered it is in this last third that the movies own political stance also seems more apparent too feeling more of a propaganda stunt on the moral lecturing on and by middle america and how it should direct its home and how it should also put it in order this isn t just about our town this is moral diction aimed at our souls and how america can better itself if its peoples excluding the poles the irish the native american and the freed ethnic minorities and minorities in general plus the supporting backbone of the americana s who still have not had a fair part in this narrative such as the middle classes can live up to the expectations of the american dream through honest decent living the purveyors of the american dream with special invitation only i was entertained slightly by this movie too but i felt that its narrative held a stronger impact than anything else that took part in it albeit the bland acting the musical score or how well or not it was made this was the movies intention to exclude other groups and to only include the likes of the webb s and the gibb s in the future of the developing country of the usa a good movie but also a slightly biased in its stance i thought taken from the play by us born thornton wilder this pulitzer prize winning play and six academy award nominated movie was the focal point on the perpetual motion of life and its three main attributes life love and death the plays translation onto celluloid comes across as a slightly to the right blurb of social consciousness our town starts off with what seems a lesson in pointlessness like other towns nothing too exciting ever happens here if anything at all this town only has the right sort of people you can still leave your back door unlocked here we are seeing the developing lives of these two families but it is their moral and social stance that is more important than them themselves our town may just have been any town just as long as you came from the right part of town that is
this movie is by far the worst movie ever made if you have to create a film costarring the guy who plays lars in heavyweights than don t make the damn film i have to say that i could watch leprechaun in space times before i could watch the trailer for this pos of a movie adam sandler should be restricted from any movie after this disgrace watching this movie is like a mix of listening to cher and willingly putting your dick in a blender anyone with half of a brain cell will realize that this movie is not worth a dime if i had an extra dollar and had to spend it i d give it to the support lorraina bobbitt foundation before buying this movie
beast wars is a show that is over hyped overpraised and overrated let s meet the characters of this obnoxious show whose creators must have been on acid to try and make a show like this cheetor seriously they need to have censor bars on this guy how come he dosen t creep out the viewers having the same voice as baby taz at least razzoff from rayman hoodlum havoc is voiced by slip slide action blast if you want a line of show that suck get g tranceformers cybertron a show that should go down in a toilet good job creators sarcasm show it self retarded boring at least the super mario games are better this show had a lot of followers sayin bring it back but i believe that it was cancelled for its own good
i think micheal ironsides acting career must be over if he has to star in this sort of low budge crap surely he could do better than waste his time in this rubbish this movie could be far better if it had a good budget but it shows repeatedly through out the movie there is one scene at a outpost which looks like its outside the front of a railway station and i bet it was there is one scene which made give this movie a and it shows the space craft landing and taking off over a lake surrounded by forests this was well done but the rest of the movie forget it there is another scene which looks like a engineering plant which i bet it and does not look like a space outpost as the character say it is this movie is stupid has a serious low budget makes no sense and god help micheal ironsides
this is one of the most atrocious rewrites i ve ever viewed if they want to make a movie with a lousy story they should refrain from giving it a title of a fine book there is hardly a relation between wolfe s book and this movie other than the title i don t mind changes if they help a story flow on screen at least the changes shouldn t hurt the final product the last scene in the movie is painfully unconvincing the actors are miscast the director and or screen writer obviously could not decide whether to make a lame comedy or preach an unconvincing sermon if you ve seen this movie and disliked it try the book if you ve seen this movie and liked it read the book
where is it written that sequels must suck scream didn t others didn t but this one sure did problems include horrible actors only christopher walken could act in the entire film bad writing you will never understand what s going on and i even have done research on the idea of nephilim before and just horrible choices for casting eric roberts makes the stupidest archangel michael that i have ever seen in my life avoid it like the plague unless you are desperate to see christopher walken in that case just fast forward to the parts where he is in the film and avoid the others yech
this debuted today on the scifi channel and all i can say is i am speechless i taped it today so i could watch it tonight after work i had high hopes now i am tearing apart the closets looking for a length of rope so i can hang myself possibly the worst movie i have ever seen i wish i could say something nice like it was fun to make fun of this movie but this movie is giving me nothing to work with i know you are not supposed to post spoilers here with out prior warning but i am going to anyway this movie sucks there i said it they should show this flick to film students to show them what not to do my nine year old niece could make a better film the only decent thing about this film is the sound and or sound track oh i just found a rusty c clamp in my old tool box i am going to put it on the thumb of my left hand and tighten it until the pain erases the memory of what my eyes have seen i could just tape over this vhs but i think i will burn it in the fire pit instead i could wash with soap but i fear i will never be clean again christmas is coming buy this movie and give it to people you hate mike
this film started out very promising with the story about a director who loses his sight and a blind woman who is bound to help him however somewhere in the middle it seemed like the script writers didn t know where to go from there one unbelievable event followed the next russia must be very small because they are all bumping into each other all the time the motivation of the female lead character comprehensible why does she still follow him after they got off the ship why doesn t she try to borrow a mobile phone on the ship to call somebody the side stories were completely ridiculous was the story with the mother and the boyfriend supposed to be funny and what was the story with the younger sister about still with all this seeming arbitrariness of the plot the movie managed to be completely predictable the saddest thing about it is that there was a lot of potential as i said the idea of the film was good the visuals and the score were very beautiful and the actors of the main characters were good too so this could have been a really good film but it wasn t
minor spoilers well i just sat up late and watched this film mainly because i enjoyed and rated some of singleton s earlier work like boyz n the hood however i have to say this was a major disappointment and is everything i hate about contrived clich d so called message movies the acting is mainly poor pop stars and models do not necessarily make good actors take note the situations hard to swallow rape victim becomes overnight lesbian please but worst of all it reinforces every screwed up stereotype you can think of by the second half of the film it has become cartoon like in its characterisation making you lose any shred of empathy you may have had for its one dimensional players not once is any valid point made about the inherent causes of racism and cultural sexual and political ignorance as a result it merely ends up sensationalising the results of these problems it s message is contradictory resulting in a sense of confusion and a general lack of plot cohesion as for the films conclusion i found it predictable embarrassing exploitative and mildly offensive for a film called higher learning i have to say all i learned is to avoid seeing this ever again if you want a true comment on some of the themes that this film completely fails to elaborate upon then go hire american history x unless you were just watching it for tyra banks then go hire a life
really bad movie maybe the worst i ve ever seen alien invasion a la the blob without the acting meteorite turns beautiful woman into a host body for nasty tongue bad plot bad fake tongue absurd comedy worth missing wash your hair or take out the trash
the storyline was okay akshay kumar was good as always and that was the only good thing about the movie kareena kapoor looked bad there was so hue and cry over her size zero but she did not looked good leaner i don t know why the hell did anil kapoor accepted such a bad role there was nothing much to do for him in the movie just because it is a yashraj film does not means that an actor should accept the role however bad it is said ali khan was alright i think that it is high time that indian directors and producers start thinking of indian customers as intelligent lot what are we fools what do they think they will show men taking on a swat squad to teeters and we will believe them is the indian police so stupid that they are trying to nab some criminals they take an entire squad of policemen and no one was there to surround the palace the action was crap and i have never seen such bad action akshay kumar was between a circle of policemen all shooting at him and he shooting back at them none of the policemen s bullet touched him but he killed all the policemen crap crap i think the fight director who thought of this scene should take retirement i strongly recommend not to see this movie
spoilers if such a thing is possible as a rabid robin williams fan i felt it necessary to buy this film as first on screen appearance wow i could not imagine a more mind numbing movie essentially the movie takes one bad joke after another that your uncle artie would tell you after dinner and dramatizes them robin williams plays a lawyer in a sec skit i m all for bawdy humor but this humor wasn t pleasantly vulgar or ribald it was just mind numbing there are no redeeming qualities to this film other than robin williams fanatics like me who simply have to own every piece of film
this should be a great film meryl streep and jack nicholson co starring as two newspaper writers mike nichols directing uh uh it s dull dull dull pointless and predictable slow and unfocused it s a cookie cutter boy meets girl boy marries girl boy has affair girl leaves boy story now theres an original concept after squirming through two hours was it only two it felt like six i wasn t sure whether it was a comedy a romance a tragedy or a soap opera it was done in i m sure all of us did things sixteen years ago that we rather would forget i hope the damage to the reputations of streep et al is beginning to heal and that the emulsion on the master is beginning to fade it s not that it s such a bad picture it s just that it s such an un good one
because that s all she does through out this whole movie is get naked for no good reason when tarzan is bitten by a snake she suddenly removes her clothes since when is a boa constrictor poisonous how did tarzan get poisoned by the way this whole movie is screwed up they couldn t get the species of animals for this movie right whats an orangutang doing hanging around those chimpanzees he must have wandered off the set of a much better film the group of cannibal tribe s men look caucasin why and why was bo and her dad painted if they were going to be eaten later it was probably just a lame excuse to show her breasts and curves again her dad while hunting approaches and acts stupidly around a bull elephant while standing too close to it any real african bull elephant that wasn t from the circus would ve stomped this moron s butt any smart hunter would ve started shooting the minute he saw it and i can t help but wonder if the camera was on lsd because it kept showing various scenes that went in slow motion for no good reason it didn t make good sense at all the boa constrictor that tarzan wrestled with in the water looks like one of those ft rubber snakes you can buy at a local spencer gifts tarzan was strangly speechless in this film maybe from bo flashing herself so much i m sorry but this is a rip off of a classic black and white tarzan movie with a similar but better story not to mention plotting there s one scene in that i saw that everyone forgot to mention spoilers alert the scene where he is trying to rescue jane and her dad has him standing too close to a running water spout it made it seem like he s urinating on someone below him eww also him and jane are fooling around on a beach with perverted monkeys jumping and clapping she sure did take her dad s death real well end of spoilers there should be a surgeon general s warning on this film that seeing bo naked too much in this movie will make you go blind
for a made for tv horror movie the movie started off very interesting i was really intrigued by the story and the mystery of the film but the ending was a total dissappointment the movie was going along fast paced and was building up to it seemed like anyway to a very climatic end but guess what there is no end the movie is just over and after almost one and a half hours the audience is just left wondering what happened why were all the unanswered questions in the film left unanswered there was no explanation at all about any of the key points in the plot this film is like watching a murder mystery and then never finding out who did it very dissappointed this film looks like the producers just ran out of money and never completed the film a real bomb
if you like the standard sly flicks that involve over the top action unbelievable stunts unbelievable is not intended to be complimentary here and retarded dialogue you will love this steaming pile of mountain goat dung i had high hopes based on the trailer i thought that stalone was going to be forced in his has been days to yield to smarter people and make an action film that would place a credible hero in a credible situation where the story setting and believable action would prevail i crave action that is at least close enough to reality that you can imagine the fear and excitement that would come from such an event my limited knowledge of hypothermia and its effects rendered at least one scene laughably ridiculous judge dredd is only better because you know going into the theater that you are going to see a comic book made into a movie the character setting and everything else are beyond comparison to anything we might encounter ourselves cliffhanger on the other hand turns a mountain climbing guide into rambo before you can say yo adrian
i simply could not finish this movie i tuned out after what i would say is my nomination for the most wretched attempt at sexual suggestion award a scene in which pia zadora at a picnic stands between two boys who want her one the good boy pleads for her to see the error of her ways the other the bad boy simply asks if she d like a hot dog which he then holds out for her at crotch level i hope i m not spoiling anything to say she turns and takes the hot dog with a smile just pathetic
the often reliable leonard maltin says this is a delightful romance and that sanders is superb maltin must have confused this movie with something else sanders is snide and droll and superb as usual you can imagine his delivery of the line regarding adultery sometimes the chains of matrimony are so heavy they have to be carried by three but dull wooden and dated describe this movie more accurately the storyline itself an autobiography with sanders as a suave jewel thief francois eugene vidocq who becomes chief of police but can hardly resist the lure of fine jewels is entertaining enough but it has the same kind of hollow historical hollywood treatment that marred such period epics as marie antoinette and certainly the deplorable forever amber which screams for a classy remake though in his defense sanders tries mightily to add some depth to his character it is all for naught i am an unabashed douglas sirk fan but this is and it is one of sirk s earliest american efforts lacking many of the signature touches that would define his florid breast heaving potboilers sirk is just getting his feet wet here and made a number of unmemorable films over the next ten years until he struck gold with magnificent obsession and hit his stride bombarding us with such estrogen fests as all that heaven allows written on the wind and imitation of life but scandal in paris is hardly his best work a relatively low budget affair with cheesy sets and ineffective costuming
this extremely low budget movie is compared to the great classic silent night deadly night since it is labeled as a slasher flick first let me say that i think that even silent night part is better than this that one was filled with flashbacks of the original for more than half of the movie christmas evil tries to get psychological by introducing the main character as someone who goes insane a strong word slowly very slowly he is irritated by people who do not get the true meaning of christmas and at work he can t stand how the fabricated toys are made with such lack of quality and love dressed up as santa he finally goes on a killing spree also a strong word since only people are killed without the real need for special effects no tension no thrills no gore no cast for one exception that is jeffrey demunn is in it he is best known for playing aside tom hanks as one of the guards in the classic the green mile he still must be kicking himself these days for ever accepting the role he truly is the only one who really can act his supporting role is better than the main lead who also isn t that bad but if you re overshadowed by a little supporting character you re not great either and what about that strange ending you have to see it to believe it christmas evil is downright boring nothing happens and the artwork is just misleading this is not a slasher you wanna see a real christmas slasher check out the all time greatest silent night deadly night
this is the biggest piece of crap ever it looks like they spent more time effort and money making the dvd cover than they did on the actual movie i really thought the dvd had been switched out with someone s homemade porno until i recognized one of the actors from the cover this movie looks like someone made it with a hundred bucks and a camcorder and they spent half of that on rats the picture is really clear but that along with the very unfortunate lighting cinematography if you can call it that production acting if that is actually what they are doing and script if they had one makes this movie look worse than an old porno at least the old porno has a point this just looks like some peta members got together and decided to make a really disturbing pointless psa about animals rights and feelings this is so not worth the money or the time it has nothing in common with the actual btk serial killer other than the name of the killer and that of some of the victims the people who made this movie should be glad he s not still free or he might have come after them just for screwing up this movie so bad
a scientist and his girl friend are out driving when his speeding causes a car crash he escapes unharmed but she is decapitated he saves her head brings it to his house and keeps it alive he then proceeds to search out models and strippers for the perfect body for the head his crippled assistant watches over the head which starts talking and has a telepathic or telepathetic link to a deformed monster kept in the closet as you can see this is pretty stupid stuff but i had a certain fondness for it when i grew up in the late s a local tv station showed this movie about times each year no exaggeration they showed it always on saturday afternoon tv uncut seeing this on tv back then was great explicit blood and gore along with a gruesome monster and sleazy sexploitation who cares if it was good seeing it now i realize how lousy this really is the acting is perfectly wretched the production values are nonexistent the script is pretty dumb and aside from the still pretty disgusting gore this is dull stuff there s also a mild cat fight between two women and the admittedly great monster at the end also add in an ending which leaves tons of loose ends on one hand this is an interesting example of a s exploitation film on the other its utter trash either way it s not a good movie but is a must see for one time only for horror and gore fans also the head s laugh is pretty creepy note the end credits which gets the title wrong calling it the head that wouldn t die
now i hired this movie because brad dourif was in it he is an excellent actor brilliant in everything except this movie and i think that was only because he realized how stupid this movie was and didn t bother with a good performance this movie is a unintentional comedy some of the lines just crack me up and them there are some lines that make no sense and it seems like tobe hooper just throw lines in without thinking about the plot oh btw the plot is bad but it one of those films that is taht bad that its actually painful to watch i recommend this only for big brad dourif fans or fans of any of the other actors because the plot is pathetic
this movie could have been so much better with a script rewrite not that i expect a great deal of plausibility in movies but you d think that even the homeless and urban dwelling jack mason would question why a group of experienced hunters would want to hire him as a hunting guide and upon reaching the hunting grounds poor ice t plays his part as if he is actually going to lead these men through woods he s never seen before and how does jack mason find thomas burns back in seattle i m assuming this movie was based on richard connell s short story the most dangerous game a few years ago i showed this movie to a class of th grade students after they read the story i reedited the movie cutting out all the pointless scenes and all the profanity it ended up being minutes long
i think i will make a movie next weekend oh wait i m working oh i m sure i can fit it in it looks like whoever made this film fit it in i hope the makers of this crap have day jobs because this film sucked it looks like someones home movie and i don t think more than was spent making it total crap who let s this stuff be released
in all my years of film going only once have i walked out on a film and that was the dreadful stay tuned fortunately the cinema refunded the ticket and i went to see buffy the vampire slayer instead a minor improvement that film is gone with the wind compared to dick a comedy so unfunny that it nearly became the second film i ever walked out of dick was so unfunny it was even impossible to laugh at it let alone laugh with it granted paying to see a movie with a title like dick suggests that it will be filled with inane dick jokes and wind up a huge letdown and yet i had high hopes because of the notable cast daniel hedaya bruce mccullough dave foley kristen dunst etc etc and a premise that at least promised something fresh what the film delivered was as portended four woefully predictable dick jokes comic timing suffering from jetlag and a premise that wore thin after the first five minutes in short it was the watergate scene from forrest gump stretched nay laid on a rack and mangled over excruciating minutes as soon as you understand that the two main characters airless insipid squealers who gasp and roll eyeballs incessantly will participate in every major watergate event you begin to mentally check off the plot as it progresses and a half minutes erased from the nixon tapes check the deep throat meetings with woodward and bernstein check john dean getting a change of heart and testifying check the process drags out more languidly and about as engaging as the real watergate affair with about as much laugh getting to boot and though it posits to be an amusing re deconstruction of the events leading to president nixon s resignation it turns into a paint by the numbers choose your own adventure fill in the blanks comedy that says very little and entertains even less even the film s strong point the aforementioned cast is bewilderingly unproductive here the most disappointing of all is harry shearer as g gordon liddy trapped as he is behind the thick liddy moustache and strait jacketed in this numbingly morose screenplay shearer mumbles a few lines tries desperately to leer from behind the prosthetic nose and eyebrows then disappears dave foley one of the comic masterminds from kids in the hall two others bruce mccullough and mark mckinney also appear in this film ah the blessings of nepotism fares badly as well his h r haldeman occasionally lends a much need lightening of the funeral plot but the funniest thing about him is the buzz cut he sports perhaps the films funniest bit of all and then there s daniel hedaya as richard nixon oops i mean dick ha ha how amusingly funny he manages to play a solid nixon avoiding the pitfalls such as overdone make up rubbery nose and false teeth a la anthony hopkins while preserving the essence the vacillations between human tenderness and coarseness i seem to be forgetting someone oh yes the two stars of the film those over bubbly teenagers can t remember their names perhaps because i have repressed their performances nothing could be farther from funny nothing could be more painful than having to endure their deliverly that ran the gamut of hyperactive and super hyperactive with an occasional pouty tossed in this film seemed to be a bad excuse to string together a s soundtrack and parade outrageous period clothing both of which seem to be the norm these days for films and tv shows set in the me decade but the clothes and the music wind up being an ersatz substitute for true characterization and plot a kind of extra plot shorthand that the producers hope will compensate for anemic writing the only possible use for this film is years down the road when any one of its talented cast appears on david letterman or conan o brien this dreadful cinematic excretion will be dragged out to embarrass and hopefully humble the stunned guest star the sad thing is that the real bad guys in all this the writers and producers will be far from the cameras gaze possibly cooking up another disaster such as this
and thats about all that is this thing is slow the actors have ability they just don t seem motivated to put forth the effort the plot isn t that great and is hampered further by the aforementioned slowness of it all the accents when there are any are british uh lots of these folks are supposed to be danes ok ok accents aren t that important but language is i don t think they used words like yeah and ok in beowulf s day and that supposedly way cool weapon his king gave him did he ever reload that thing did he ever sight it in or was beowulf just that bad an aim well his aim did at least match the computer graphics used in generating the monsters those were rather off too bad special effects bright spot just one that i can think of marina sirtis has held up well over the years
i saw this movie as a very young girl i m now and it scared me witless for years i had nightmares about every aspect of this film from the way it was drawn to the music to obviously the violence my parents still argue about who allowed me to watch it and both of them say that they would never let me watch such a movie i think they only say that knowing that i have such strong feelings about it i am currently reading the book out of morbid curiosity and the fact that it s a classic and it is really a great story however i don t think that it should have been made into a cartoon ever well maybe kids nowadays would find it quaint but it gave me nightmares for weeks and weeks and i still have a hard time seeing rabbits drawn in a similar way gives me a little heart palpitation every time yah i am a wuss but i strongly suggest that any parent looking to show this movie to their kids read them the book instead or watch it first to make certain that they approve of the content not everyone finds it as disturbing as i did but we are out there
show me your boobies is not funny and certainly not on a channel that shows cartoons if you understand where i m coming from i don t want my and years old daughters thinking like that or hearing that i find it sad that nick hyped this crap that much and then that s what we get stupid little kids acting like stupid adults i know it s meant to be humorous but consider we out there that have sweet little innocent girls in k and st grade who can t wait to see this i had to comment on how disappointed i was when i saw it my daughters won t be watching it i d love to block nick but don t have the heart at this point but if nick keeps putting out this kind of crap i ll have to
i love jamie foxx and i enjoy of all movies i see and i walked out of this one now i admit it may have had something to do with the two middle aged white women in the back of theatre who laughed at every little thing oh no jamie s knocking on a door hee hee hee but this was just so incredibly annoying there could be no sustained camera shot and no camera shot from a conventional angle everything had to be in your face loud and annoying the bad guy tried to be smooth and malkovich like but at this point it s just old and tired he brought nothing new or interesting from all the characters too many lines you saw coming too many you ve heard before and too many tough guy lines and i don t mind that sort of thing really as long as there s a bit of originality to it in fact pretty much the entire supporting cast just sucked i love jamie foxx and i think he s really funny and i thought he was funny in this movie but not nearly funny enough for me to endure everything else this movie needed less shoot em up less annoying camera shots more emotion more feeling and more jamie foxx i gave it a
oh dear the first time i heard of this bad show was when one of my friends was yelling like an idiot johny test while we were playing video games i thought he was confusing johny quest by the way one of the best cartoons i ve ever seen in my life and changing the quest with test its something weird that i m wrong but actually i was wrong he wasn t changing nothing he heard of this show one day while watching tv i heard that cartoon network was going to be released i wasn t sure of what was the plot of this show so i adventured myself to watch it and here is my answer i want my damn hour back because i watched this crap and my gym partner s a monkey this is one of the worst shows i ve ever seen first the beginning with the most stupid song in the world then the plot oh where are my manners i haven t said the plot of this show is about a boy who has to amazingly intelligent sisters that have a lab and make experiments with their own brother ohhh now i see why his name is johny test he is the test of his sisters experiments you know i honestly miss dexter s lab before it was transformed to the new dexter a total crap too this is a bad copy of that old good show except that this show is amazingly bad don t watch it make something more productive in that half hour than watch this crap
i am not one of those people who just go online after i see a movie and decide to call it the worst movie ever made if you doubt me please look at my other reviews however for the first time ever i have seen a movie so horrible that i wanted to write about how bad it was before it was even over i love bad movies to me ed wood is a genius i thought bloody murder jeepers creepers and most horrible horror movies were good however there is not a single good thing i can say about this film the plot is basically non existent if someone reading my review wastes their money to see it they can discern for themselves what the plot might be but i advise you that a nickel would be worth more than watching this movie the special effects are bad the acting is bad the two leads are attractive but that s all there is i am not the type to spoil a movie for anyone but i invite anyone to email me at foxbarking yahoo com to ask for my opinion on this movie before they waste a dime on it i will tell you anything i love bad movies and i love horror and i love new inventive movies i even love horror porn stuff like hostel which some reviewers claimed this was like but obviously they only thought so cause roger bart was in this and hostel but this may be the number most worthless and stupid and dumbass movie ever made and before you disregard this review this is coming from someone who not only sat through the entire premiere of house of the dead but actually bought a copy of it
i m not sure it was the language or the poor acting but everything about this movie feels and looks cheap and fake after seeing der untergang this is a huge disappointment there s no connection between different scenes and the acting is so incredibly poor i couldn t even believe people could make such a mess of something that had great potential and above all everyone in germany speaks english big mistake the german language has a certain sound to it and especially hitler himself only sounds like hitler when he s speaking yelling german the way the story is told made me believe it was improvised on the spot the characters were empty and the movie seems to be a collection of random events that could have happened whether it s the english or the fact that i ve already seen der untergang everything about this movie was fake and ridiculous
i can t say this is the worst film of all time but only because there are still some movies i haven t seen yet this has to be the most pretentious attempt at making a movie of all time the director suffers from the same issues he had with there will be blood though he wasn t quite as bad in that film the whole movie it feels like you re watching a guy trying to hard to impress beyond his abilities it s like he sits in his little director s chair and thinks how would a great filmmaker handle this scene he just doesn t have it in him i don t know if this film could be saved by a great filmmaker there were certainly some nuggets of greatness that could have been polished but nothing was brought to ripen the scene where all the characters are singing was the worst moment in cinema history one by one as we see the characters singing and i squirmed in my seat i kept saying please please just don t have the guy on the brink of death singing too sure enough massive failure
first off the title character is not even the main character of the movie he is the sidekick of the cult leader the actor who portrays igor believed that screaming loud laughing hysterically and having a crooked smile while bugging out your eyes would be an excellent way to scare people igor also had the annoying habit of yelling because he never actually just spoke in a high pitched voice he would also say idiotic one liners for example when the cult leader murders one of his followers with a buzz saw igor upon seeing this yells out paul no paul why d you do it i could have cut her clean so clean in another scene igor tells a victim that she would have to get her own tools for surgery because right now it was his time to operate aside from the bad acting the ending did not make sense because while the story builds up what little steam it has towards the climax which is igor getting a crossbow arrow to the head and the rest of his lunatic buddies being killed he shows up again two more times to kill the remaining good guys the movie offers no explanation of this only telling the viewer that igor escaped from the mental hospital what bottom line is do not waste your time watching this movie i wish i could get back the moments i lost watching this
i almost saw this at an actual movie theatre an art house theatre no less but couldn t make it there in the one whole week it played but yesterday i finally saw it on cable and well i wasn t disappointed that s for sure madonna has done it again yet another bomb when will this woman learn when will the studios learn or perhaps they already have since this film was largely dumped with little fanfare and deadly word of mouth one would hope that being directed by her talented husband who s created some interesting and or terribly entertaining work would bring out the same quality madonna showed in desperately seeking susan alas it just isn t meant to be for here she is at her very worst singularly convinced of her own greatness the smugness permeating every frame she s in made all the more unbearable by her wavering faux british accent an accent that only underscores the fact that her speaking voice is immature in quality and not especially pleasant this may sound unnecessarily cruel but listen to the woman and look at her films of say the past decade like a latter day bette davis there is an unmistakable brittleness to not only her carriage but to her very face and body which here despite the warm photography displayed throughout the film perhaps its only saving grace are done no favors to her credit the entire affair is so misbegotten that one wonders if the world s greatest actress on her best day could do anything with this mess no one involved escapes unharmed bruce greenwood actually seems pained to be on screen though poor jeanne tripplehorn seems to carry herself as if she s actually in something good which had me thinking all the while denial ain t just a river in egypt adriano giannini son of giancarlo giannini star of the italian original swept away is like his father before him immensely attractive and isn t altogether bad despite winning a razzie nomination for worst actor but like almost everything else about this production it all comes back to madonna on whose shoulders rest the blame why her why not her husband director guy ritchie just who do you think was behind this remake what actress wouldn t want nearly every shot of a movie to be centered on her with only a relative nobody sharing the screen oh sure ritchie deserves some blame surely he or someone anyone should have and could have taken his lead aside and insisted on something bordering on actual feeling in her line readings for her performance is so wooden it s a surprise the rest of the cast didn t get splinters or at least display a semblance of warmth but she seems resistant to be anything but a cinematic black hole above and beyond anything else this is strictly a vanity project for its star so she is ultimately accountable for it a film like this an odd couple ish war of the classes should be light and fun with leads who can bounce off one another with witty even romantic dialogue for what else can a film whose plot involves two disparate people stranded really be honestly i don t think anyone involved knew exactly the tone they were trying for it succeeds neither as comedy i defy you to laugh even once or romance madonna s ice princess routine precludes any chemistry it s not even bad enough for us bad movie lovers to enjoy a real shame
i have seen and liked the original film and expected more from a remake than this good effects and makeup are good no complaints about the score and visuals they are adequate and the performances were okay tim roth was excellent the other principals were fine and a handful of the supporting supporting actors did very well with extremely limited roles the action scenes were exciting and fun bad the escape from the ape city was terrible the characters are going in circles then suddenly someplace in the middle of town there are tunnels to escape plus what escape route leads through everybody s bedroom the story was pared down to include as much action as possible i like action scenes but the original film had more meat to it and deserved more respect finally the ending was completely nonsensical as presented without seeing the inevitable sequel there is no justification for it
to preface this review i must say that i was i suppose a little curious about this movie however i probably would not have seen it had i not had my arm slightly twisted in my opinion this movie shows just how depraved man can be in my eyes the worst thing about this whole springer phenomenon is not that type of people on the jerry springer show act as they do which in itself is eminently reproachable but that many people are so curious and excited to watch them and hear about their lives yes i suppose that includes me to whatever extent it is true if not glorifying that kind of behavior as some might say at the very least we may be subtly corrupting our minds and or desenstizing ourselves to this type of behavior but enough soapbox sort of here s the skinny the movie has an r rating and while it may deserve only that i did look away at some scenes so i m not completely sure i feel that an nc tip of the hat to the other reviewer might be a little more appropriate for the immense sexual content a cynic might comment that the movie was just one big excuse to show sex on the big screen the plot is very bizarre tying together the stories of an absolutely dysfunctional family and a group of stereotypical blacks upset who will appear on different springer shows at the end the movie leaves one with some resolvement and springer rhetoric about the need for us to see the real world evidently as seen through his show i agree with him there it is important to know how the world really is so that we can seek to effect positive change having said that let me just tell you the world s pretty bad glance in a newpaper or the news to see that but let s not shell out good money to support the kind of sensationalistic and perhaps formulaic titallition that springer seeks to give us
poor performances by sinatra martin and hyer grossly underdeveloped supporting characters annoying talky with no real plot ending leaves you flatter than a pancake with more loose ends than you could tie up in four sequels that is if you even cared about these wooden characters maclaine is the only real asset that penultimate sequence in which the chicago hood searches for the sinatra character is laughable the music in that sequence also is poor and in the final scene when martin s character removes his hat for the woman he called a pig almost made me go outside and find a stone to throw through my television screen
the movie is plain bad simply awful the string of bad movies from bollywood has no end they must be running out of excuses for making such awful movies or not the problem seems to be with mainly the directors this movie has good actors who have proved in the past that the have the ability to deliver great performance but they were directed so poorly the poor script did not help either this movie has plenty of ridiculous moments and very bad editing in the first half for instance after his st big concert ajay devgan meets up with om puri from whom he ran away some years ago and talked to again and all om puri finds to say is to beware of his friendship with salman what a load of crap seriously not to mention the baaad soundtrack whatever happened to shankar ehsaan loy ajay devgun is total miscast for portraying a rockstar only saving grace are the good performances in the second half ajay shines as his character shows his dark side so does salman as the drug addict watch it maybe only for the last half hour
note i couldn t force myself to actually write up a constructive review of prom night it just can t be done instead i went through what i thought about while watching the movie things that i thought about while watching prom night i m so tired of those dreams where these elaborate deaths will take place only for the main character to wake up right before she bites it of course when i say elaborate deaths i mean off screen throat slashes or stabs in the stomach didn t the whole it s just a dream thing get ruined by dallas speaking of which i wonder if a couple stabs in the gut will cause immediate death the film is only ten minutes into and i can already count the horror clich s on two hands not a good sign even after just meeting the protagonist s boyfriend i m convinced he will die anybody want to place bets the killer in this movie is a teacher that is obsessed with the main character donna by the way does anybody think that donna is a horrible name for a main character in a horror film he spends three years in a maximum security prison before breaking out and finds donna celebrating her high school prom while there is no accounting for taste i seriously wonder who would take all that time to stalk somebody as dull as donna high schools allow proms to take place at hotels and doesn t keep track of the students apparently students are perfectly able to buy a hotel room and go in and out as they please i suppose if this plot point wasn t in place the movie would be minutes of people being bored out of their mind and randomly biting the dust whenever they go to the bathroom i suppose the trade off for their excitement is my utter boredom with everything i ve already played count the pieces of chewed bubble gum under the seat and guess how much money i have in my wallet and i m only in the minute mark how else will i entertain myself note to self don t forget milk and bread on the way home dear screenwriter you ve used up enough false scares to get through this movie and every other horror remake this year the version of this film wasn t that good but compared to this remake it was like citizen kane or at least the godfather it had jamie lee curtis in one of her many post halloween horror flicks and it did have a little twist at the end i miss jamie lee i wish she d act more apparently at prom there isn t much dancing going on instead the girls get in fights with their boyfriends over where they plan to attend college i hear all these colleges being brought up by name and i can t help but wonder who these girls have to cheat off of on the entrance exam to get in the killer must carry a bag of really effective cleaning supplies and wipes up his mess between scenes that s the only logical explanation for why he could stab somebody to death on the carpet or in the bathroom and by the time somebody goes up to the hotel room there is no trace of a struggle on another side note this is a very lazy killer michael myers went hunting after his victims just saying it s official the entire audience in the theater is rooting on the killer what triggered it was it whenever donna went back up to her hotel room while sirens were going off ordering everybody to exit the building was it her constant dreams and how even after going through something dramatic in said dream she insisted on reenacting her steps to a tee or was it brittany snow s unconvincing performance i ll have to say it was all of the above okay who had he dies off screen in the third act you win the pot finally the movie is over my friend turns to me and says donna wasn t too smart that s the understatement of the week kind of like saying that a tornado is a small gust of wind or a week long power outage is a slight inconvenience i can t wait to get on rotten tomatoes and see if anybody gave this move a favoring review i can t recommend this i refuse to recommend this this is as lazy of a horror film as any and the only way to enjoy its cheese smelling plot is if you are under the influence of at least ten beers and unfortunately for theater patrons alcohol isn t served rating out of
i went to see this film with fairly low expectations figuring it would be a nice piece of fluff sadly it wasn t even that i could barely sit through the film without wanting to walk out i went with my two kids ages and and even they kept asking how much longer after lasting until the end i just kept wondering who would approve this script even the reliable fred willard couldn t save the trite dialogue the state jokes and the banal plot i d suggest that whoever wrote and directed this movie i use the term loosely should take an online screen writing class or drop by their local community college for a film class at the least there are many books on directing screen writing and producing movies that would teach them something about structure plot dialogue and pacing
nine minutes of psychedelic pulsating often symmetric abstract images are enough to drive anyone crazy i did spot a full frame eye at the start and later some birds silhouetted against other colors it was just not my cup of tea it s about minutes too long
first off let me say that this has to be on the top of my list of boring movies nothing and i mean nothing in this movie is even remotely thrilling most of it is very confusing and as it progresses you just wish it would end some people want a movie that makes them think through the entire thing to which i say more power to you i on the other hand just want to be entertained which brings me back to this stinker entertainment it is not this movie is stupid and a complete waste of time seems that most here agree also most of this didn t make any sense and by the time you think you have one scene figured out another lame scene comes around and well i guess you see where this is going avoid this one sucks bad
ripoff of a dozen better films particularly steven martin s la story which at least had the grace to be obviously fictional even though it starred his then girlfriend playing his girlfriend in the film yes naive boys and girls dates is a mockumentary although i am not absolutely certain that was myles berkowitz s intent when he started my impression is that he started the project semi seriously then quickly realized that it would be pathetic and not funny unless he made the situations more and more ridiculous as a result the whole thing has an uneasy cheap and insincere feeling about it as someone smartly pointed out the film has two of the dates suing and putting restraining orders on myles and yet they appear in the film which would be impossible as it would require a consent form it also appears to me that the majority of women who appear as the dates are professional actresses albiet not famous ones excepting tina carrere they are simply too obviously pretty polished thin and comfortable in front of the camera to be average civilians mr berkowitz makes a classic error in only casting this kind of very pretty thin actress instead of utilizing a variety of believable women which might have made the premise even in a mockumentary more believable and funnier he also skates over what is probably his real world problem and which is that both the movie character and the real world myles berkowitz appear to be functionally unemployed his real life imdb credits are practically non existent excepting this film even in the world of the movie his ex wife divorced him for never being employed i think the viewer let alone mr berkowitz s real life dates are deserving of an explanation of he manages to live in one of the most expensive urban environments in the us in a luxury apartment driving a fancy car and eating out at pricey restaurants when he doesn t seen to have any source of income whatsoever is he drug dealer living off his rich parents no clue you can get away with most anything in a film if the jokes are really funny dates is painfully embarrassingly un funny mr berkowitz s idea of a joke is to have his character while on restaurant dates announce to his companions how the food served is likely to give him either diarrhea or constipation the worst kind of childish potty humor it is not very surprising to discover that mr berkowitz never made a film before dates and in the last years has not made a single film appeared as an actor in anyone else s film or had a writing or producing credit of any kind my gut instinct tells me that this film was not financed by elie the gangster money man who appears off camera but more likely by mr berkowitz s affluent parents or perhaps represents a shocking abuse of credit cards whichever it was we can all rest easy that we are unlikely to have to see myles berkowitz or any of his creative efforts ever again hallelujah
this is one of the few episodes if not the only one with an indisputable error in its storytelling while handling the ralphie situation christopher states that he has heard about pie o my s death in the fire accident this is an important detail because in this context it is quite obvious that christopher knows from the beginning that tony is the one who must have killed ralphie there is however no way chris could have heard about the accident who should have told him and when by the time he is torn out of his delirium by tony s call nobody else was informed tony knows that which makes it even worse hearing christopher talk about pie o my s death could therefore only lead tony to the conclusion that chris himself has set the fire given the impressively elaborate writing process as told by the writers themselves on the dvd i really wonder none of them realized the problem there the story just doesn t work that way unnecessary to add that i m a huge fan of the sopranos otherwise i certainly wouldn t care
watching marlen brando on screen is like watching a master carpenter chiseling intricate details into a piece of mahogany brando s acting is the only thing that makes this movie watchable the plot is inane and laughable not comic the other big name actors seem to be making desperate attempts to give the characters they portray some modicum of humanity these characters have the humanity of wet cardboard everything about the technical side of this film is either mediocre or just plain awful the director throws freeze frame and slow motion shots about with impunity the incidental music is cartoonish and destroys any hint of dramatic effect it s not something i really look for in a movie but even the wardrobe was way off the venerable brando couldn t take focus away from the awful rags they had him decked out in i ve heard this movie called david lynch esquire and irreverently funny it is neither david lynch films are borne of wicked creativity this film was in no way creative and don t confuse irreverence with stupidity
oh my where to start this movie was just awful the writing was bad acting was bad special effects were bad i think the only good thing about this movie is that it made me laugh i was in the mood for a scary movie but certainly didn t get that i thought it would be decent enough since i m not picky i ve watched several bad horror movies in fact it is my goal to see all horror movies not matter how awful they may be at one point in the movie i made a comment about the corn syrup blood and in the special features they actually admit that it was karo syrup brand name corn syrup the movie had all the necessary things for a horror movie blood nudity crazy killer stupid moves but it was just completely lacking anything to really make it good the writer should either take some classes or just give up
this show is awful how is george wanting the death of his mother funny this show is terrible the parents are obviously horrible and the children should be taken to child services the daughter is a witch with a b and the son is just a complete brat george isn t funny especially when he speaks his loud and obnoxious brand of spanglish ernie is a loser but at least i ve chuckled at him a few times but mainly at how pathetic he is george s mother benny in an awful despicable character sure her husband left her but how anyone can laugh at the way she treated george as a baby is beyond me can someone explain to me how george s head being big is funny it s not even that big i ve moved on from characters because they re too awful and it would take hours for me to write and i frankly don t care enough i do care enough to tell anyone looking at this and wondering whether or not they want to watch this show that this show is an abysmal excuse for a sitcom and is not worth your time i give it starts because the wife is extremely attractive
i didn t expect a movie as good as in the line of fire or an episode of but it looked like this movie was made for tv and did a mediocre job at best the good cast couldn t disguise the fact that the plot was all too predictable and actors had to struggle they really try their best i think through their lines of bad script giving their rather flat characters any extras when i watched the movie i got the feeling that i had seen most of this in other better movies in it you had car chases big shootouts romance plot twists etc etc this movie has none spoiler as soon as you see another woman talking into the phone to cuba s character you know who s behind all this and all the hints you re being given you stand too close to the president see it from my perspective sound silly if it were up to me and maybe it s a good thing that it isn t i would rewrite the plot like this first lady orders the murder of her husband because she is sick and tired of writing checks to cuba all the time
the reason i intended to give this movie a chance to take hours of my life actually it was only minutes was my wish to try to understand and hopefully appreciate indian cinema all i have ever seen were few older movies of s ray browsing through imdb i came across this one and after seeing rating of i concluded this must be the one which will open the doors of unknown and bring artistic enjoyment oh my how wrong i was the only logical explanation for this rating of is that most of people who voted are indian and their only venture outside bolliwood production were adam sandler movies with this rating this movie would be ranked on th place on imdb list of best movies above citizen cane goodfellas of psycho i am really not in a mood to review and criticize because there is simply nothing that i find worth remembering from this painful experience my only hope is that there is a lot of hindu who like me find this movie as is plain stupid with abundance of kitsch and cheesy music
i feel the movie did not portray smith historically the goal of this movie was to tell smith s life in a way that would be comfortable to the lds church leaders historical accuracy seems to have been of little concern the movie was designed to be a faith promoting experience not a balanced view of smith as a man i have taken it upon myself to study smith s life and have read both lds works and none lds works the movie like most lds projects was beautifully filmed and well acted however this was not a realistic portrayal of either the beginnings of mormonism or smith s relatively short life a significant period of time was given to reenacting an accident that smith had when he was seven while this event was no doubt important in forming his mental outlook it appears that the main reason for including it in the film is to help establish a sympathetic view of joseph smith another point is in portraying smith s teen years the film is silent regarding the smith family s involvement in magical practices during the s another problem is while the movie shows joseph smith good naturedly entering into wrestling contests it fails to show how he sometimes lost his temper and became violent i could go on and on this movie was not historical in any way and should be considered a fictional movie about a man i would not recommend seeing this movie for any other purpose other then entertainment
stupid mindless drivel about a jet assembled within hours by mechanics who have never worked on airplanes piloted by burgess meredith chasing a porsche race car which runs on decades old gasoline sludge driven by lee majors with chris makepeace as the runaway techno wiz who can mcgyver spare parts into a radio receiver which can pick up all frequencies simultaneously and who somehow learned how to acquire and use chemicals to make high explosives in a perfectly peaceful society as moronic as it sounds terrible waste of burgess meredith but chris makepeace may at least be forgiven on the grounds that this was only his second film
okay it seems like so far only the barman fans have commented on this film time for a counterpoint beware this writeup is long for those not in the knowing mostly the non belgians tom barman director of this film is the frontman of deus one of the better known rock bands of the late s here in belgium basically they made a couple of very adventurous and innovative albums and quickly rose to fame on the national scale then egos started hurting and the band basically fell apart with barman and a couple of others remaining to go on making albums under the deus monicker the way it always happens in such cases the post breakdown deus was a lot tamer and less interesting than the original they tried to go for an international breakthrough with their album the ideal crash in presenting a much diluted form of their earlier style of songwriting they didn t quite make it however egos were still pretty big it seems big enough for barman to consider himself enough of an artist to try on movies more often than not this sort of thing is a very big mistake and this film does not make the exception and barman clearly went for art on this one another very big mistake for one thing he s a musician not a movie director for another deus at it s best made fun and provoking music but never anything close to what i would consider art it shows so what s this movie about basically it tells the story of a bunch of completely uninteresting people doing equally uninteresting things over the course of a totally uninteresting friday in antwerp as even more uninteresting stuff happens to them in the act of being uninteresting the characters are shallow the plot totally pointless and the film just doesn t have any other redeeming qualities to make up for these shortcomings humor the whole film made me smile slightly about times and actually managed to provoke a single second laugh not quite loud mood the film just doesn t seem to show any kind of emotion or feeling at all mystery well minor spoiler the idea of the wind man inspiring the name of the film is as enthralling as a banana pepper pizza not very and has been done a thousand times before anyone remember johny destiny one of tarantino s worst appearances on film to date end minor spoiler and well its artistic so don t expect any kind of real action to make up for all the previous in other words except for the few smiles it bored me out of my shorts so what remains well the soundtrack is pretty good though it suffers from some of the same problems that other ost s have shown lately first it makes the movie seem like nothing more than a commercial for the cd second it gives the impression that barman is trying to hide the weaknesses and lack of emotional content in the film behind the content quality of the songs which simply doesn t work in the end it makes the film look like nothing more than an illustration to the songs and sadly it s barmans own contribution to the soundtrack which gets the most attention though it is the weakest part of the whole soundtrack as far as i m concerned all in all it just stands to show that barman knows more about music than movies camera work is okay as well though not anything that would make you scream out with joy the only thing about this movie that kept me watching was the sight seeing factor since i originate from antwerp it was fun to play a kind of guess the location game i would hardly consider this as a quality though all in all another chance lost for flemmish film i keep on noticing that lately the best belgian movies have been coming from the french part of the country this is mostly because at least they have something to tell and manage to tell it in way that is both sharp and emotional the brothers daerden come to mind maybe the flemmish art house filmmakers should try that too
wow i thought this might be insipid but it was even worse than i imagined sometimes i like to watch a good car crash movie those that are so bad that you can t look away because you want to see how bad they can possibly get this is really the only reason i could leave the television on morbid fascination it wasn t so much the acting which was only mediocre or slightly worse than one would expect from this cast but the premise and the plot which never should have seen the light of day the script too is groan inducing as for cinematography did anyone else notice that they used a curtains drawing segue device like in an old s tv show but without irony at first i thought they must be kidding but the movie takes itself too seriously to have used this in a tongue in cheek manner don t even ask me about the score the only high point is the final song by morcheeba i guess they wanted to leave people with something for their glad i saw it on tv just silly i wonder if this is why timothy hutton has had trouble finding much work recently i guess if you don t expect much and want to watch a mindless thriller it would be better than spending an evening clipping your toenails which is why it merits a
i watched this film version of r d blackmore s classic novel as a substitute until the a e version was released on video and what a poor substitution it proved to be this version does not have the authentic i feel like i m there aspect of the a e movie the actors are for the most part wooden with sean bean the exception and the romance seems forced and contrived in fact there is no kissing until the end of the movie the triangle between john ridd lorna doone or lady lorna dugal whichever you prefer and the evil carver doone isn t mentioned or expanded upon we don t get much insight into carver here or as to why he has some if any romantic feelings for lorna this movie cuts out many of the key and interesting characters of the novel such as counsellor doone and john s sharp tongued youngest sister lizzie which were crucial to the plot the screenplay itself is lacking in conviction the political intrigue also doesn t figure in the script the way lorna came into being with the doones isn t true to the original story now don t get me wrong clive owen is a handsome and talented actor watch gosford park and king arthur for confirmation but he comes across as bland and stoic throughout and long hair it may have been a bad wig just doesn t suit him polly walker is a lovely and accomplished actress see enchanted april and patriot games in which she also costarred with sean bean but she appears colorless and lackluster she has a cold sore on her lip that make up can t hide and the costumes don t seem authentic the late robert stephens does a respectable turn as sir ensor doone although he only refers to lorna as his favorite rather than his granddaughter which she was reputed to be in the book also it seems to me that owen and walker are too old for their roles maybe it s the make up and the scenery is brown cold gray and barren without so much of a hint of a sunny sky i understand that it is set in southwest england but it is green there and they do get their sunshine the portrayal of tom faggus character and his death which doesn t happen in the novel depresses the film even more the one positive note is sean bean s performance as carver although it doesn t even come close to matching aidan gillen s portrayal in the a e movie bean does make one mean villain in short watch this only if you ve got a few hours to kill but don t expect anything exciting or for it to be true to the novel see any other version but i highly recommend a e s film over this tired adaptation
a disappointing film the story established our protagonist as chrissy a young rather sullen individual drifting not doing much actually she does very little to move the narrative along so it didn t surprise me to see the focus shifting on her relatives it s a pity though chrissy seem like interesting character story was predictable and at times felt quite formulated so the question now is when are we going to see the campions jacksons and the tamahori s breaking ground with compelling cinematically told stories that will inspire rather than entertain for the toll of two hours technically a disgusting shot film
from the decrepit ranks of the already over saturated hillybilly horror sub genre comes this woeful tale of a vacationing family terrorized by inbred rednecks sound familiar well it most definitely should to anyone with even a cursory knowledge of the horror genre there is absolutely new here the film seems content to recycle all thee old worn out clich s deformed hicks a peaceful family turned gun toting killers when push comes to show the rebellious daughter the one freak who s good at heart etcetera but does even that half heartedly enough to make this an utter waste of time this is forgettable dreck but humorously enough lead j d hart once starred in a movie called films that suck earlier in his career quite an ironic omen indeed my grade d
from the acting direction scriptwriting and art direction this film is just entirely ill conceived and the money would have been better spent on shoes for land mine victims when did we get so sad that they have to fill a a children s movie with sexual innuendo to keep the parents attention dr suess is rolling in his grave right now what with the dirty ho s h i t and fake erection scenes etc etc etc its shameful how they trade on the name of suess to get the parents to bring their kids throw in the profanities to try for the teens and a few sad parents who won t watch a a film with their child if there is no t a greed greed and more greed compare this to the classic children s films and we can get a disturbing view of world is turning into these guys should stick to making mtv videos how on earth this movie got votes as a perfect is beyond me unless its the directors family
being a fan of movies like fire sale where s poppa airplane i saw this because it was mentioned favorably in the context of real comedies and satires like the aforementioned well wrong conclusion not only is this not funny it makes you angry because it isn t bad in a schlocky likable way but in a really bad way it s bad bad the script does not contain a single funny line which is rather in the way when you re trying to entertain your audience with humour adam arkin s speech impediment is probably the single most annoying thing in this movie still this cruelty of nature doesn t prevent him from being smug throughout the movie and he has a hard time not looking into the camera this amateur without charisma fits in nicely with the constant continuity errors and bumbling along of the story if you can find one ed mcmahon i had to think of jay leno another late night talk show person who always refuses to call himself an actor well i ve seen a few leno movies and he s laurence olivier compared to mcmahon kenneth mars is good though in the few lines that he s given i m not easily frightened by bad comedies so i kept watching and looking for all the quasi jokes every minutes or so the movie actually becomes sort of a comedy as soon as alan arkin takes over he literally does starting minutes into the movie he s in every scene but it s too little too late when movies try to fool you into believing their lack of professionalism is the reason you re supposed to like them because they have the right intentions they remind me of pupils that haven t prepared for an exam in those cases you have to remain strict and the grade has to be an f but please don t assume i m a teacher that is a profession with a respectability somewhere between politician and child molester if you actually look for a likable schlocky horror scifi movie that is fun to watch and does contain jokes try man with the screaming brain by bruce campbell or watch sunshine core if you prefer modern loud shallow scifi schlock those are equally funny albeit involuntarily
i just loved watching it though and having fun with it s total badness of a film i saw this film through the helpful sarcasm of mystery science theater and i have the dvd if you flip the to the other side of the dvd they show the actual movie so i gave it a chance seriously folks this is grilled cheese the acting special effects and plot in general is very cheesy and unrealistic doesn t she need lungs said crow noticing how the head can still talk while it doesn t have a body and tom servo just wistfully remarks no she s got neck juice the ending is just classic and no one can touch this soundtrack with k porn i loved the cat fight between the two strippers that meow after the fight or scene whatever was classic so in some ways this was a fun movie i think for horror fans you ll probably enjoy it for a good time watch the mstk version you ll get a great laugh mst k version the brain that would die
if you re a fan of the late gram parsons then this movie is definitely going to divide you part comedy part road movie but mostly a bad fictionalization of one of rock history s oddest tales spoilers basically the story concerns a well known roadie named phil kaufman played by johnny knoxville who supposedly made a pact with cult rock country folk music hero gram parsons that stated when one of them died first it didn t matter which one it was that the other living one was to take the deceased out to the desert joshua tree national park in california to be exact and set the body ablaze so as to free the spirit and become one with the earth and so on sure to keep his word the barely sober kaufman with the assistance of a self hating pot headed buddy jacks the body of the late parsons whom had fatally overdosed from a drug and booze bender a day prior from the airport and shortly after that what ensues is a cringe worthy combination of fiction and truth where the late parsons girlfriend kaufman s girlfriend parsons stone faced father and a gaggle of police officers and other pointless idiotic characters all try to beat the clock so to speak in trying to catch kaufman and his pal before they get the chance to torch parsons body the film s incompetent direction bad acting and lame offbeat tone in general all sink this movie faster than the titanic and not to mention the huge fact that this movie is not even halfway telling the truth of the actual events that took place the accuracies that should have replaced the inaccuracies as far as i ve heard them include number parsons was married at the time of his death and even had a child so what the hell was that all about with the girlfriend s and the chasing and whatnot number kaufman s drugged out buddy was a known willing participant unlike what the movie attempts to portray in the disposing of parson s body and finally number gram parsons real life father died when he was just a boy and so it was parson s step father who could have honestly cared less about gram parsons when he was still alive in real life that took care of the body after it was torched altogether though what probably disturbs me the most about this movie is that the real phil kaufman was actually on set to help assist with the facts of the story and yet still the movie ended up becoming so untrue and so bad that it really boggles my mind frankly also as the mediocre aforementioned acting in the film is concerned it s lead character played by the ultra grating johnny knoxville phil kaufman is not only a bad actor but it actually seems as if he were asleep throughout most of the movie and the rest of the pathetic cast are for the most part either hysterical brain dead or seem utterly clueless as to what they re actually doing there in the first place overall if you like johnny knoxville and or really dig the so bad they re not even good buddy flicks then i suppose you just might get a kick out of this movie but if you re like me and are a fan of the late gram parsons enjoy films that attempt to tell the truth as much as they can especially if they re based on an actual real life story and or you just like good films be them road movies or fictional slice of life stuff you will truly loathe this film and advise others to do likewise i obviously hated this movie and wished it had never been made in the first place but since it was made i would have preferred it to have turned out differently than what it did unfortunately maybe some day the real facts of the story will come through and be made into a really great biopic on all of gram parsons life not just what happened to his body after his spirit left it but until that time comes all we as an audience and or fans of the late performer get is this sad waste of film and an all around terrible memorial of sorts to the musical legacy that gram parsons was known to have left behind it should also be noted that they did actually use parsons music and a few others as well in the flick but not surprisingly though you never get to hear enough of it to really enjoy it even in the slightest bit turkey zero stars
what can possibly said about this movie other than viewer beware christmas evil should come with a warning label like cigarettes do because this was harmful to my eyes and ears i am rarely this unsatisfied with a b horror flick but this movie couldn t even bring a little scare to a five year old the point of a relentless lunatic that has a thirst for blood in a film is that he she should seem almost god like like nothing can stop their maniacal rage but in this film the resident psychopath gets himself stuck in a chimney in a bizarre attempt to surprise his next victim and of course follow along with the all to popular legend of santa claus it s a reminder to the viewer that this man is in no way dangerous because he s far too stupid to be dangerous all in all a total waste of film
this is the worst thing the tmnt franchise has ever spawned i was a kid when this came out and i still thought it was deuce even though i liked the original cartoon there s this one scene i remember when the mafia ape guy explains to his minions what rhetorical questions are it s atrocious many fans hate on the series for including a female turtle but that didn t bother me so much so that i didn t even remember her until i read about the show recently all in all it s miserably forgettable the only okay thing was the theme song guilty pleasure they call it nananana ninja
utter dreck i got to the minute second point and gave up i d have given it a negative number review if that were possible although pissible is a more fitting word unlike the sizzle you could see and practically feel between macmurray and stanwyck in the original the chemistry between dumb ol dicky crenna and whats her face here is just non existent the anklet becomes an unattractive chunky bracelet there s no ciggy lighting by fingertip and i thought i d be sick when they have a mortified looking and rightly so believe you me lee j cobb as keyes practically burping upchucking his way through the explanation of his little man to mr garloupis no offence to the non sighted but it looks as though a posse of blind men ran amuck with the set design of both the dietrichson and neff houses the same goes for those horrid plaid pants that phyllis wears and crikey how much does neff make that he lives overlooking a huge marina this folks again all takes place in the first and a half minutes if you can get through more of it you have a much stronger constitution than me or you are a masochist but please take some alka seltzer first or you will develop a little man of your own that may never go away proceed with caution obviously
this movie had the potential to be far more than it was but it not only fails to deliver it brings up nauseous self righteous preaching at the same time john cusack is even flatter than he was in midnight of the garden of good and evil the difference is that this time he is supposed to have an southern accent which he noticeably loses several times each scene al pacino does his shtick but seems to be walking through this film and collecting a paycheck he s good as usual but hardly standout supporting cast throw in female romantic interest which added little if anything to the story speaking of the story a convoluted who really cares tale where cusack is the self righteous mayor s boy who just has to search for the right thing to be done people don t act this way cusack s character loses all credibility at the end of which without revealing it is preach and nauseous the final scene makes the penultimate silliness seem profound it s also completely inaccurate but i won t get into law this is a bad by the numbers movie it seems interesting for the first minutes and then it s really a preachy proselytizing self righteous film for the last hour better off with mindless crap than this pile of junk
humm an italian movie starred by david hasselhoff and linda blair i wasn t expecting very much to be honest and in fact i took even less than i was expecting it doesn t mean this movie is the worst i have seen because i have watched worse things than this but the plot was most of the times confusing and uninteresting and some good gore scenes are the only thing saving this apart from that you are going to love some special effects they are really cheesy and bad now i only want to watch troll by this same director sure it is not going to be worse than that
at first look of the plot tagline i figured it could have been a decent film could i have ever been more wrong the beginning of the film makes it look like a bunch of freaks got together and decided to make a low budget film for the first minutes you don t notice the cheesy acting horrible sound and god awful special effects but then it gets worse just about minutes into it i was asking myself what was the plot again i could only ask that question when i wasn t busted out laughing from the sheer lameness of this film the main actor has one setting for emotions and he sticks to it throughout the entire film even though he was supposed to go through love and hate and everything in between the flashback scene almost made me vomit because it made me re live one extra minute of footage from earlier in the movie now we hit the middle of the film where they are obviously trying to rip off morpheus from the matrix although he is doing just a horrible job the actor s talking about star wars and fortune cookie phrases is almost unbearable now at the end of the movie you don t realize that it s the end of the movie because you actually think the plot is finally developing the morpheus character dies the only good thing about the movie he utters a couple words and the credits roll what is this no plot bad acting cheesy everything it couldn t get any worse please if you value human decency do not watch this movie
i m in iraq right now doing a job that gives plenty of time for watching movies we also have access to plenty of pirated movies this gem came along with other movies and this is easily the worst i ve seen in a long time i ve seen a few other reviews that claim this movie doesn t take itself too seriously but really i think that s a cover up for the fact that its horrible it s not tongue in cheek the writers really thought they were improving on the movie blade this movie is just one notch above vampire assassin which if you haven t seen i recommend at least that movie is so unbelievably bad that you ll laugh harder than you thought possible this is right at that cusp of no redeeming qualities what so ever from the bad acting to clich visual ie opening credits to the adobe premier special effects they couldn t even get blanks for the guns which may have to do with where the movie was filmed but if you re going to use effects make them close to accurate as for the cast it seems like they just went to a tae bo class and picked up the first not to ugly chick that walked out once again like ron hall in vampire assassin don t let stunt folk act they can t also the comment about this being a return of old vampire movies no it s not this is exactly what all new vampire movies are about buffy the vampire slayer blade underworld they re all about some super star fighting the vampires this is the newest vampire genre with bad blood fake screams and cheesy over acting obviously anyone who wrote a good review about this is somehow connected to the movie or friends of the cast but what do i care i paid cents for it anyway to wrap this up someone in their first semester of film school decided to make a movie i give them credit because it s better than i could do of course i also know i can t make movies so i don t try i do know how to watch movies though i work hour nights days a week i ve seen several thousand in the year i ve been out here and this was so bad that half way through i was hoping for a mortar attack
i simply cant understand why all these relics from the ceausescu era refuse to let go one can see clearly how frustrated they were during the commie censorship that forbade them so many things to show in their movies and now they imagine its dunno what big deal of artsy fartsy freedom so fill the screen with people defecating urinating vomiting swearing and any other kinds of hideousness imaginable this is not cinema friends and neighbors this is simply visual perversion forget about bunuels chien andalou about david lynch about forman and neorealism and other movie makers who were able to work with an aesthetics of ugliness those people were mastering their jobs well you don t do us a favor all you daneliucs and nicolaescus and saizescus and muresans and marinescus and margineanus and other obsolete old timers and leave us alone its bit time to see some romanian movies on screen enough with your immature terribilisms you are not directors you are illiterate
a scientist john carradine sadly finds out how to bring the dead back to life however they come back with faces of marble eventually this all leads to disaster boring totally predictable s outing this scared me silly when i was a kid but just bores me now i had to struggle to stay awake with one exception the acting is horrible such expressionless boring actors hopeless there are some good things about this carradine despite the script actually gives a very good performance and there are a few mildly creepy moments involving a ghost of a great dane walking through walls there s also one of the worst looking knockouts in cinema history still none of this is fun enough to sit through this avoid
this movie wasn t that bad when compared to the first two sequels to the original it s directed by martin kitrosser of friday the th fame the acting is very bad indeed but the gore and special effects help make it interesting thats one thing i like about screaming mad george make up effects artist for the film his effects are so off the wall and bizarre that they will keep you watching a bad movie just to find out how crazy they re gonna get the movie isn t really all that gory but there is an extremely nasty eyeball munching scene in the middle involving a toy maggot what mickey rooney makes a guest appearance that he probably wasn t too enthusiastic about but needed the money at the time possibly if you liked the weirdo th installment my favorite of all you ll probably like this one i liked it better than the matrix enjoy
if you are planning to rent or buy this movie don t it s the worst thing i have ever seen i would comment on it more but it has been years since i saw it and have blanked all of it from my mind save yourself some time money and well being and stay far far away
this one features all the bad effect of prior s cheap o movies but is so overtly racist nasty and unpleasant that it is difficult to give this piece of dreck any redeeming feature unless you plan to enlist in the marines skip this one oh and even if you do avoid it at all costs
even in a bad film there is usually some redeeming feature something that you can say yes it was terrible but there was that performance or that part of the script or that special effect this was just simply terrible all over the acting was laughable the script terrible complete with many inexplicable breakfast at tiffany s references and even the special effects were shoddy at best this was a very bad film and one that even drew barrymore wishes was expunged from history watch it if you want to a suffer harsh self inflicted pain b see just how bad a film can be this is one film where i can use the clich there s ninety minutes of my life i will never get back with some justification
most of the episodes on season are awful there is no comparison to twilight zone or outer limits as they programs actually had decent story lines most of amazing stories are well dull not amazing in the least go rent or buy the twilight zone series i have heard season of this series is much better also for some reason on the dvd s they cut out the ray walston parts which further diminishes this compilation the one cool thing is to see actors and actresses when they were younger in most of the story lines are very predictable though and the series could of been better with twists and turns that left you wondering
a pretty average scifi film the plot was more or less obvious from the start although the acting was reasonably good the writing seemed very cliched using ideas taken from numerous films the basic plot scientists working on a deep space research platform rescue a fighter from crashing into the red dwarf that they have been orbitting onboard they find a stasis pod which coincidently malfunctions at that very moment after or minutes of the man in the pod waking up you realise that he is a complete lunatic something which totally escapes the person crew of the research ship after that it becomes a rip off every other film involving a psychotic madman terrorising innocent victims overall i think speed was a better exploration of the subject matter which i didn t consider to be a good film either not a good film get aliens out and watch that again
oh god what an idiotic movie incredibly cheap with fake special effects the creature is played by one guy in lame costume and stupid plot all dialogues are unbelievably bad and these actors ha ha ha they re simply ludicrous for example i have never seen so annoying characters like in this junk these dumb kids or pregnant woman with his husband and many more all in all this is a great entertainment if you re drunk avoid it like the plague am i drunk i don t think so
when i say doctor who you might conjure up an image of tom baker or jon pertwee or maybe peter davison when i say james bond you ll almost certainly conjure up an image of sean connery while a small handful of people may think of roger moore or pierce brosnan but when i say sgt bilko absolutely everyone will think of phil silvers unlike doctor who or james bond the role belongs exclusively to one actor and that s the problem with this film version you ll continually wish you were watching the old black and white show in fact the whole idea of making a film version of bilko without silvers in the title role comes close to sacrilage
the genre of suspense films really takes a dive in this one the big problem is implausability i realize that you need to create difficult situations which would cause suspense and the tense feeling of whats going to happen next but this movie was so predictable and is just not believable i find that the more i watch this kind of movie the more i am continually saying things to actors to direct them away from danger continually making bad decisions just borders on being plain stupid if they took the time to make it more realistic i might have enjoyed it a little having said that you might be better off staying away from this one
anna lives with her family in a new housing estate just outside the city she has been with her husband sebastiaan for years and they don t talk so much anymore while on a working visit abroad a female colleague commits suicide anna is deeply impressed by her death even though she hardly knew her nobody seems to know why she took her own life for the first time anna realizes that one can be an unknown among your most dearest anna doesn t mention the incident back home and starts observing her husband and child guernsey is the story of a woman who suddenly starts looking at her own life and she wonders how she got so drifted apart from the people closest to her this is my translation of the dvd cover text synopsis i hope you find it useful as this movie doesn t have an imdb plot summary yet at this date
how did mike hammer live in a penthouse with a golf bag stashed in the corner next to a big screen cathode ray tube tv and a snazzy fireplace nah he d knock back a bottle of rye and twenty unfiltered camels on the couch or floor of his fly specked office or in the stink of a lousy downtown la flop house wiping the dried red crust and oil smeared mud off his face that s how spillane wrote trash paperbacks for sure but how do you make it worse give some desperate scheming producer a blank check because he thinks any film noir titled crap will sell at the box office add some over the hill hot tomatoes and just generally screw up the story line by some retard drugged out screen writer that s how
it is pretty surreal what these flies can do eh well this is a cartoon so anything can happen in it at first i must tell you that i love animated movies unfortunately this year s repertoire is very weak this cartoon is nothing but a list of flaws i quoted the tag line it suggests that this movie has great d effects well i did not see any at least not something special i never saw before the flies in this movie look nothing like real flies at least they could ve make them black but cyan flies seriously with giant heads and slim torsos the story i guess it was written for year old kids i could tell it in two sentences it is so over simplified excessive patriotism for example they are american files after all oh give me a break
what this movie fails from answering is how wrong this war is and most us wars recently made only to get some oil how many innocent civilian casualties there has been how many lives perished and how blatantly stupid the perpetrators are so let me ask you if american soldier kills women and children apart from enemy its ok but if government accidentally kills their own forces by deadly chemicals while killing many civilians as well it is not your logic fails gentleman i ll give it for the solid performance and to everything else in total
lady in cement pi spoof with ole blue eyes frank sinatra is a shamus on a houseboat in miami in this rarely funny comedy burdened by an annoying and repetitious hugo montenegro score and bunch of misfiring punchlines this flick just never rises above slightly too bawdy to be on tv made for television movie status dan blocker is effective in the mike mazurski ted de corsia big galoot role and raquel welch should thank her personal trainer the only thing that makes the dvd worth keeping or seeing is the collection of cheesy trailers for welch flicks like bandolero fantastic voyage mother jugs speed and myra breckinridge even if you get the dvd skip the predictable movie and go for the trailer library in the special features besides tons of mysoginistic asides sinatra lisps the homosexual owners of the local go go bar a relic that needs to be put back in the time capsule d
this is the worst movie i have ever seen everyone involved should be embarrassed everyone ice t is pitiful the dialogue is absolutely awful and hokie does not begin to describe the performances by every single actor in this movie the plot steals heavily from executive decision but compared to air rage executive decision is academy award material i have never been so disappointed when watching a movie air rage should be burned with its ashes locked in a vault never to see the light of day again anyone who has seen it should take a shower and wash the stink of horrible movie off of them the best part of this movie probably comes from the ending when the credits rolled this was easily the worst movie i have ever seen ice t should stick to law and order and the other people in this film should retire early or commit suicide either way they should never attempt to be in a movie again
from this awful movie there are so many things wrong with this film acting writing direction editing etc that it s amazing that something rises to the top and proves itself to be the absolute worst the music i noted that the film has two composers listed this must be the reason why every single frame has music of the absolute worst d movie style drivel they have never heard of the expression less is more it got so painful to listen to i muted the sound every time there was no dialogue not that the dialogue was that good you have to feel sorry for robert wagner and tom bosley i m sure they didn t see roles like this in the twilight of their careers see it at your own risk
spoilers i shoulda figured the dvd didn t even show the time or how long it was i thought wild cardz was the worst anime movie i d ever seen this one is much worse makes no sense thrown together plot all so we can see oversized breasts on a figure that doesn t support them it had to of been a student film that musta gotten a c grade quality entertainment until i found out it wasn t going to end the ending made no darn sensereplayable
i have watched some pretty poor films in the past but what the hell were they thinking of when they made this movie had the production crew turned into zombies when they came up with the idea of making it because you sure have to be brain dead to find any enjoyment in it i am a fan of most genres and enjoy shoot em up games but merging the daft scenes from the game just made this ridiculous and unwatchable as most have already said there was hardly any script and the acting was weak i won t waste my time describing it anyone who rates this film above has to be part of the production company or sega or else they have a very warped concept of entertainment i must say i was more annoyed with the video shop who gave this a thumbs up which led me to rent it thank god i had a second film to watch to restore some of my faith in movies comic book guy would be right if he said worst movie ever
this movie is a vehicle for schwarzenegger clone alexander nevsky his charisma however is insufficient to lift this movie above the level of its poor script he has little to add to his arnie act michael york is quite pathetic as the begging diplomat watching him revisit his d artagnan act from the time that he was a better actor made me feel uneasy come on you can do better than that the story is full of holes and unexplained relations top of this bill is the informer of vlad who sounds like an american woman but from the context appears to be working for a russian government department although the story takes place well after the end of the communist regime all the russian characters are still very communist like in contradiction to that vlad is allowed to drive a pimped up all utility vehicle as police car the action scenes are poorly shot and therefore lack dynamics not a must see movie
this film was terrible i have given it the high score of as i have seen worse but very few from the clich d start of having the end of the film at the start and going back to the start at the end this film used everything in the box of tricks used in film making just for the sake of it like a kid with too many toys there was the endless boring repetitive narration slow motion freeze frame flashbacks and merged images etc none of which made a dull film any better it is called years of alcohol but there was little drinking or drunkeness and no depiction of withdrawal with the film jumping about all over the place with no coherent sense the story was badly written and extremely pretentious and the direction was equally poor and it is a shame that people have put up further money for more films by mr jobson previously know for being in a rubbish group and on tv making as much sense as this film does i found it a major struggle to see this to the end but in the hope of it getting better i carried on to the bitter but it really was a waste of time and i would have been better off not bothering
if you are one of the people who finds according to jim great television comedy this is going to rock your world and might i add kudos for proving that good talent good writing and a charismatic star are all you really need on any network other than abc which prefers to air crap like jim belushi s show year after year k is a big steaming brown german shepherd sized thank you for all of the geniuses who loved the first movie it s exactly what fans of that film and the lesser belushi deserve jim s comedic chops and choice in projects are never far behind his ability to butcher a blues standard look for him to try to showcase all of his diverse lacks of talent into every project he hurls at the public like a surly zoo chimpanzee if you enjoy jim s work this movie is your reward
warning contains many spoilers let me start by saying i have a huge respect for gillian anderson s incredible talent as a varied and versatile actress which is why i cannot comprehend her reasons for agreeing to make this film once she saw the script or lack thereof the premise of the film was in my opinion a great idea and there were some genuinely thought provoking themes in there but it ended up like a collapsed souffl it exemplifies why i hate of british cinema it feels too long it s tedious for the most part and not a lot happens after the first twenty minutes just when you think there s a chance of it picking up some speed it disappoints like paula radcliffe running a marathon with little imaginative directing and a minimalist plot there isn t much to keep the audience from nodding off into their popcorn as for the script i can only surmise that the writer was trying to save a few trees with the average scene reading something along the lines of alice f off adam stares adam runs off into woods alice follows alice adam adam i suspect that word for word the actors probably got paid more than kate moss did for her virgin mobile adverts what few lines there were didn t have a lot of variation with a frequent use of the f word that would make bridget jones s friend shazza proud there is little establishment of the main characters before the main sordid event which leaves the audience lacking much sympathy for the characters beyond an automatic oh that s terrible reaction alice isn t the kind of woman who courts sympathy either she s got a great job an expensive london apartment with roof space to die for yet she comes across on screen as conceited bitter and dissatisfied before her life takes a turn for the worst after the attack a few layers are peeled back which sort of explain why she is this way to start with she grew up with a tough as old boots soldier who thought that teaching her how to shoot his gun was the ultimate expression of love so instead of following in his footsteps she ran away to the big city in search of something to make her feel like her life is worth living instead she found a group of stereotypical middle class toffs who look down on anyone not rich enough to drive a lexus and the luxuries that come with an integrated security entertainment system i e becoming mrs robinson to a wanna be cockney wide boy electrician someone pass me a tissue the one saving grace of this character is that she is played by gillian anderson in the hands of a lesser actress she would ve been intolerably one dimensional but ms anderson actually manages to inject a few fleeting moments of humanity into this otherwise lifeless human being most notably when she s sincerely apologising for her road rage in a vain attempt to stop her attackers from continuing their assault i can t say that adam fared much better either danny dyer played him well as a fish out of water jack the lad but a good performance couldn t save him from both the lack of a script and the total absence of any character background this film relied mostly on shock value but the timing was off and it felt far too engineered from beginning to end as for the shock the most shocking thing about this film is the unashamed demonstration of how painfully thin ms anderson has become it was almost as unsettling to see as the brutal attack scenes on a side note only in a british film would a gang of violent sex attackers take the time to offer each other contraception before continuing to cheer their mates on talk about stiff upper lip taken to the extreme if this is the kind of film that the national lottery is donating money to make then i m not surprised that fewer and fewer people are choosing to spend their pound each week saying that i hated this film is giving it too much credit i didn t care enough about any of the characters to warrant that strong an emotion i want that one and a bit hours of my life back please
this rubbish excuse for television is the single most god awful piece of trash ever to hit australian television the house mates are dull uninteresting ridiculously unintelligent and are picked on the basis that you would be likely to attempt to murder them if you had to live with them as far as i am concerned big brother is the decline of western society showing how us as a society are on a steep slope to becoming brain dead morons whatever happened to television that didn t target the lowest common denominator of society as an audience this cannot be classified as entertainment i think that it true that channel ten can remove your soul it happened to rove mcmanus who was once a respectable comedian and once moving to channel become horribly unfunny with the exception of the simpsons which is highly intelligently made
i watched this movie after seeing other comments on imdb even convincing my wife that it was a unique horror movie i wanted to like this movie but was unable to the love story was good but the horror aspect was quite bad if the story was just about a young man who fell in love with a girl suffering from parasomnia then it would have been a better movie the care centre stretched credulity well past the limits in fact it was quite ridiculous the doctor happily ignors privacy laws and professionalism a nurse goes into a room for a routine feeding of a dangerous patient without security escort and drops the tray and runs out of the room screaming for no apparent reason the forensic patient and the film s villain is tied up in a standing position fully clothed apparently for years none of it makes much sense the movie even had some actors that i ve liked in other things such as the detectives but still i can t recommend this movie
completely ridiculous period film is only a thin excuse for its extensive graphic depiction of the heroine s affair with the beast a monster who supposedly appears every century to rape some women that s pretty much what he does and the film s depiction of the beast is really really awful it s basically a tall guy in a fur suit with a mask and a huge pvc tube for a hard on that squirts copious amounts of white liquid for fans of fake animal porn i guess maybe this is a real turn on i was amused however by the opening shots of horses having sex in a public square
this film is about a group of five friends who rent a cabin in the woods one of the friends catches a horrifying flesh eating virus suddenly the friends turn on one another in a desperate attempt to keep from contracting the disease themselves cabin fever is a horrible film for one it tries to be many genres at once is it supposed to be a homage a slasher a black comedy or a scary movie with unintentional comedy nobody can tell there s a serious scene at first and a second alter it turns funny when the film tries to be funny the humor is quite bland excluding the ending i liked the ending a lot but apart from the ending i was pretty disappointed and disgusted the violence is cringe worthy more looking away from the screen than being scared the tone changes within each scene sometimes funny sometimes scary and sometimes quite random in fact you see a girl doing karate in slo motion what are we supposed to get from that this same girl would bite one of the characters was that supposed to be funny i don t know some of the performances were decent and many were quite amateurish i didn t care for most of the characters i liked the plot but the execution was done horribly as a horror film i didn t know what it was trying to be i didn t find it funny tense nor scary by the end you re left indifferent thinking what have i just been through unfortunately you ll never know the answer to that question
i was really really disappointed with this movie it started really well and built up some great atmosphere and suspense but when it finally got round to revealing the monster it turned out to be just some psycho with skin problems again whoop de do yet another nutjob movie like we don t already have enough of them to be fair the creep is genuinely unsettling to look at and the way he moves and the strange sounds he makes are pretty creepy but i m sick of renting film like this only to discover that the monster is human albeit a twisted demented freakish one when i saw all the tell tale rats early on i was hoping for some kind of freaky rat monster hybrid thing it was such a let down when the creep was revealed on top of this some of the stuff in this movie makes no sense spoiler why the hell does the creep kill the security guard whats the point apart from sticking a great honking sign up that says hi i m a psycho and i live down here its stupid and only seems to happen to prevent franka potente s character from getting help what the hells he been eating down there i got the impression he was effectively walled in and only the unexpected opening into that tunnel section let him loose so has he been munching rats all that time and if so why do they hang around him so much why is he so damn hard to kill he s thin malnourished and not exactly at peak performance but seems to keep going despite injuries that are equivalent to those that cripple the non psycho characters in the film the dvd commentary says we are intended to empathise with creep but i just find him loathsome its an effective enough movie but it wasted so many opportunities that it makes me sick
okay as a long time disney fan i really hate direct to video disney sequels walt himself didn t believe in them he believed in and they lived happily ever after being the end of it but this one really ticked the taco there were so many ripoffs of other disney films in this it wasn t funny quick summary if you don t already know melody the daughter of ariel and prince eric is born ursula s sister morganna who basically looks like ursula if she were to dye herself green and go on the ally macbeal starvation diet shows up and after trying to do the newborn tyke in and failing prophesizes doom for the characters after that ordeal ariel goes into a lapse of being like her father and refuses to tell melody about her mermaid heritage and later on forbids her to go near the sea well surprise surprise melody finds out being the stubborn brat she is and runs away then makes a deal with morgana to become a mermaid in exchange for something gee does that sound familiar she becomes one but in her half of the bargain has to retrieve her granddaddy s trident and bring it back to the sea witch while doing this she runs into a couple of outcast animals a penguin and a walrus named timon and pumb huh wait no that s not timon and pumbaa or is it could of fooled me anyway i d like to reveal more but pretty much anything that could be guessed to happen does ok so long story short this movie borrows too much from other better disney films and does it horribly come on tip and dash why not just make dash obscenely flatulent and make it an even more obvious ripoff ugh not to mention the total character butchery of ariel s persona she s gone from being a freespirited headstrong woman to a clone of her father not good at all they re basically telling us the sweet firey little mermaid we ve known to grow and love is dead plus melody herself isn t such a great character either she s damned annoying and bratty not to mention what they ve done to flounder ugh anyway if you decide to see this piece of created mainly for profit reasons no imagination eisner sponsored c t i suggest maybe waiting till its on the disney channel or some other tv station because it s not even worth the price of a rental out of stars
you know you re in trouble when the opening narration basically tells you who survives it all goes downhill from there unnecessary matrix influenced bullet time camera work pointless cuts to video game footage crusty old sea captains and wacky seamen ravers who become skilled combatants in the blink of an eye even the zombies are boring i was hoping for at least a so bad it s good zombie movie but this one is so bad those involved with its creation should be barred from ever making a movie again
i had high expectations of this movie the title translated is how we get rid of the others after all the concept is great a near future in which the ruling elite has taken the consequence of the right wing government s constant verbal and legislative persecution of so called freeloaders and the left wing in general and decided to just kill off everyone who cannot prove that they re contributing something to the establishment the establishment being called the common good but actually meaning the interests of the ruling capitalist ideology very cool idea ideal for biting satire only this movie completely blows its chance the satire comes out only in a few scenes and performances of absurdity but this satire is not sustained it is neither sharp nor witty and for an alleged comedy the movie has nearly no funny scenes the comedy i assume is supposed to be in the absurdity of the situations but the situations are largely uncomfortable and over serious rather than evoking either laughter or thought the script is rife with grave errors in disposition the action should have focused on the political aspects and how wrong it would be to do such a thing but instead oodles of time are spent on a young woman who was the one that wrote the new laws for fun and who s trying to save everybody by organizing a resistance that ships people to africa all this is beside the point a movie like this should not pretend to be so serious it s a satire a political statement but it doesn t even begin to actually address the problem it s supposed to be about maybe it was afraid of going too far how cowardly that s not art it s not even real satire s ren pilmark a very serious and by now one of denmark s absolutely senior actors was very good he largely carried what little entertainment value the movie had everybody else nothing special well perhaps except for lene poulsen who did supply a convincing performance in fact a problem with most danish movies is that the language never sounds natural neither the formulation nor the delivery why is it so difficult to make it sound right why must it be so stilted and artificial i hope when people look at these movies fifty years from now they don t think that this was how people talked in general danish society out of
encompassing virtual reality the potential of computers communication with the past the ongoing struggle to express your identity in a constraining society and the fascinating ada byron lovelace portrayed by the fascinating tilda swinton this film should have been great but it is lousy terrible if you consider the potential the acting aside from tilda swinton and karen black veers from tolerable to atrocious the plot construction is awkward to say the least the modern day programmer is a dull one note character but half the movie is spent setting up her character and then when ada finally appears it is to narrate the events of her life not to present an engaging story swinton almost pulls this off though you never fully get to know her as a real person just an icon from a grad student s history paper the digital effects such as a digital dog and bird are lousy and distracting considering it was and not and finally the script is just bad bad often pretentious dialog especially the fights between the programmer and her boyfriend which made me squirm cold and distant characters and zero attempt to create a sense of wonder the programmer successfully contacts a person in the past astonishing but it hardly seems to surprise anyone and her boyfriend says well be careful although we re given no clue then or later why it might be dangerous and it never seems to actually be dangerous also despite being about computers and ada lovelace and her love of mathematics it is clear no one involved with the script had any knowledge of mathematics or computers any references to these subjects come across as complete mumbo jumbo that defies any suspension of disbelief one scene towards the end of the movie is quite good a monolog by tilda swinton expressing her sadness at the fragility of life but her joy in that life poignant passionate and insightful it seems to be dropped in from another movie so i am disappointed in this movie because it is a missed opportunity for a fascinating little cult film if you find the subject matter interesting you might want to rent it but be forewarned see orlando for another much much better examination of gender roles in history with a great tilda swinton performance spoiler question at the end of the movie ada asks that her memories not be preserved in what i thought was the best scene in the movie but then the modern day programmer seems to do it anyway transferring the memories into her little girl hence the title of the movie am i correct that the programmer violated ada s wishes without even struggling over it or is this another confusing plot point that i m misinterpreting
i found a dvd of i dream of jeanie in the bin at wal mart when i saw that it was the story of stephen foster being a musician and music educator i had to see it i had no idea what year it was made for it did not say on the cover just that it was a remake of s sewanee river bill shirley s portrayal of the composer is sometimes painful sometimes laughable the man has no testosterone and is a wimp all the way through i have a difficult time believing stephen foster thought music publishers were doing him a favor by publishing his songs without paying him for them in addition to that ridiculous notion there is a nearly minute segment of ray middleton and his black faced christy minstrels performing stephen foster s songs that was difficult to watch to say the least i can hardly believe anyone would consider this movie appropriate to resurrect in our current time it is an embarrassment and should remain forgotten fortunately stephen foster s songs will never be forgotten also eileen christy s portrayal of jeanie was certainly the highest point in this lowest point of hollywood history
though frank loesser s songs are some of the finest that broadway has to offer they re bollixed by joseph l mankiewicz lethargic staging and uninspired presentation when it s over it barely feels like you ve watched a musical mankiewicz doesn t seem to know how to present loesser s challenging but tuneful melodies for maximum effect for example one of the best numbers the showstopping adelaide s lament concludes by having adelaide vivian blaine belt out the finale while sitting on a chaise lounge and stubby kaye s faux spiritual sit down you re rockin the boat has his backing choir sitting in folding chairs while he simply stands there mankiewicz zaps all the fun out of everything by letting static scenes go on too long and his dialogue adapted from abe burrows stage book has none of the wit that his films like all about eve have part of the blame has to go to the leads just about all of whom are miscast marlon brando looks bewildered as to why he s in a musical frank sinatra plays way too nice a guy and has none of the edge which makes him so essential the songs are not tailored to his style and jean simmons barely registers the way a shirley jones might only blaine as the lovelorn showgirl adelaide commands our attention like a broadway pro should the colorful art direction is by joseph wright and howard bristol created the flashy sets
scary yes scary jam packed with nudity from fat people to skinny people maslin beach takes place on a nudist beach in s a i first saw this film two years ago it s safe to say it made a bizarre topic of discussion at school the next day this film was horrible hardly a romantic comedy just a showcase of nudity this movie hit its lowpoint with one of the new age characters staring down between a girls legs girl you re not going to find god in there guy nah but i think i found heaven steer clear of this one unless you want to hear amateur actors discuss topics such as farting adultery and the process of superlguing one s genitals together avoid
ok so i hear about this new justin timberlake movie coming out which features some pretty big names i mean great actors like the freeman aka morgan freeman an asset to hollywood however completely wasted in this film then we got kevin spacey who i ve been a great fan of ever since i watched american beauty and the usual suspects both of these great actors probably signed on to the movie thinking it was going to be a great movie as i did when i heard the story then enter a fresh faced justin timberlake i say fresh faced because this is his first movie and those rotten tomatoes haven t hit him yet well the reason for that i might add is because no one will ever see this movie or even bother reading this review the movie is so terrible that when i got into the first minutes of it the characters were so one dimensional that it makes some bible characters look like the don corleone they got the one liners and sound bite worthy stuff the token troubled black guy ll cool j who is with a gorgeous woman who he otherwise would not even belong with in real life the captain is this short whiny guy who speaks in such a high tone and what crappy movie would be complete without the hero becoming richer because of an experience oh and lots of gun fire i mean a whole lot spoiler not the kind of gun fire that leaves everyone in the police force who s crooked dead and the hero prevails they got flame throwers and rocket launchers really no kidding bottom line if you want to see edison its because you are a great fan of one of the actors or a great fan of justin timberlake to all the year old girls out there enjoy i wish i had more hands because then i would have more thumbs because this movie is so terrible because then i could give it so many thumbs down that thumbs down would no longer mean anything because this movie is so terrible because it sucks so badly that it made me laugh out of frustration about the story line because it just would not end because the firing and yelling just kept happening may g d have mercy on us all and save us from these terrible movies well it could be worst another rnb terrible actor turned singer turned terrible actor is usher hehe check out in the mix lol or even get rich or die trying now the special thing about that movie is that its got year old men playing or even younger teens i could go on with these
this movie joshua is extremely disturbing and downright pointless it actually makes me shudder to think there are people who would enjoy watching it without giving away the story it is about a young boy s reaction to his newborn sister and that is just the tip of the iceberg during the entirety of this movie the viewer is subjected to some of the most unsettling child behavior imaginable adding insult to injury by the end of this movie there is absolutely no real outcome except the fruition of pure evil at the hands of a child no less who outsmarted a whole group of dumb adults there is no redemption no justice served and a whole group of adults who are not smart enough to see what is going on around them frankly i did not enjoy watching this movie it was extremely unsettling even for those who might enjoy horror movies this movie could be too much despite the fact this movie was well acted the story itself is so disturbing that watching it was equivalent to a minute wait in a dentist s waiting room in anticipation of some painful dental procedure
final score out of possible scene specific spoilers but who the hell cares yes that s right zero and i rarely give s even for the lamest of movies i look for things like music cinematography imagination it s humor even a good pace to be as objective about the score as possible looking at it within it s own genera or subgenera but there is absolutely nothing redeeming here i can t remember another time a movie actually sent me pacing up and down the room when it was over the only reason i made it to the end was because i couldn t seem to change the channel i sat there simply aghast watching to see what insultingly stupid bit it would come up with next it was like watching a snake digest a rat but let s have some fun and pull this baby apart shall we first of all there is nothing technical about whipped that works the visuals are all sitcom style the cut scenes all just pictures of the street traffic going by at night over and over the music and score not only doesn t contribute anything to the movie it s obnoxious not to mention it doesn t have anything to contribute to anyway the acting is as cardboard as it comes all around and that goes for amanda peet clearly the star that got this train wreck green lighted too these guys supposedly good friends have no more chemistry or sense of purpose then if director peter m cohen had rounded them up at a bus station minutes before shooting on the creative side there isn t an original bone in it s body it has no imagination it shows us nothing we haven t seen a thousand times before the whole premise or twist of this movie is based on male bashing and the idea that an empowered women can play men just as they get played anybody that thinks this is somehow a twist or is in any way original has obviously never turned on a tv before twisted shallow women are common male bashing is the norm it s not stealing from anything specifically it s worse it s stealing from clich s i can t imagine a women making a movie that depicted other women based so much on stereotypes and with this sense of contempt makes me want to go rent in the company of men or better yet there s something about mary this movie wants to be a edgier version of there s something about mary so bad you can see the sweat the movie has no insights into women men dating sex or really anything cohen is simply content to regurgitate myths he has been indoctrinated with from other sexist movies on the other end the movie doesn t work as a satire either because even though it is ripe with exaggerations one could view as satirical it doesn t have that grounding in reality that satires need it doesn t even know what it s satirizing then there s the dialogue which is little more then the characters screaming obscenities at each other example character f k you character oh yeah well f k you repeat and the bottom line the thing that could excuse all the other discretions there are a lot of movies without plots without good acting with morally repulsive characters and obscenity laced dialogue that have been funny and thus been good whipped ain t funny not for a second it has no comic skills or timing the situations are all completely phony not based in any shred of truth especially enough to wring laughs out of us the characters all broadly drawn so they will seem relatable to the lowest of the lowest common denominator just look at the marquee scene cult classic hair gel scene one of our bumbling anti heroes opens the medicine cabinet and sees mena peet s vibrator for some reason light shines down on it as if he s found the holy grail why cohen thinks men react this way to vibrators i do not know while he rubs it on himself he drops it in the toilet and then attempts to fish it out with his bare hands when oh my mena walks in on him oh my sides but strangely enough people actually like this movie of course people also like friends and reality dating shows so i shouldn t be surprised all of this has a common thread however whipped is big evidence to me that there is just a huge pocket of people in america that will laugh at any joke just because it is about sex they will like any show or movie or think they like it just because it is about dating or relationships it s lack of any quality has no baring on these people just as people are indoctrinated to want whiter teeth and thinner bodies to sell toothbrushes and weight loss programs they are also indoctrinated to blindly lap up anything dating relationship related to sell them cheap empty effortless tv movies and any number of products the only consilation will be that when i die because i saw this movie i ve got a credit to get minutes of my life back
watching this movie is like eating a banquet of nothing but meringue it initially looks great but ultimately provides no satisfaction none the plot is a muddled mess about a toy factory and the forces of evil so how is it possible that with this basic plot and robin williams that the movie still turns out so badly it s because the picture is all appearance with no substance whatsoever much like the terrible popeye picture williams did at the beginning of his film career the film must have cost a fortune but perhaps there wasn t enough money left over to hire writers who had graduated grade school the film is one unfunny joke that goes on and on and on and on i really am unsure why it was made in the first place it certainly wasn t made to provide any sort of entertainment
this must be one of the worst movies i ve ever seen the graphics are ridiculous and the script pathetic and the biggest question is how this rather low brow script got trough the selection process i like all sorts of movies from deep dramas to the more male oriented kill everything you see type of movie so i can t say i m picky i have been struggling to find something to compare it to but i just can t think of anything that matches this maybe starship troopers witch in my opinion makes the movie gods cry and me thinking about throwing out my dvd player but compared to this its effects are great the acting superb and the script should be awarded you know when a movie is bad in a funny way well folks this isn t one of those this kills your soul minute by minute
what an empty and lack lustre rendition of the classic novel i do wish people would stop messing about with classics when they clearly have no idea of the real intention or point of the original this version is no different i felt that the ralph fiennes version is much worse though as the casting of juliette brioche as kathy has got to be the worst casting decision ever anyway back to this version it aims to make the story relevant to a contemporary setting and in a musical style it succeeds in both but high art it is nit throwaway viewing for a rainy day maybe the direction was average and the editing abysmal worse than the old quincy deepak verma does a great turn as hindley and is in fact one of britains wasted talents the part of heath was played with great charm and belief and i think that the casting is the strongest point of this project although a more talented director would have made better use of the facilities he had its clear that he was a director for hire and didn t instill the project with the passion that it deserved
i have been a fervent hal hartley supporter since i saw his short surviving desire in high school and even then was still completely unmoored by his searingly brilliant henry fool but this year later sequel is not only unnecessary it s disgraceful after a choppy and expeditious start fay grim devolves into pseudo intellectualism flat out boredom and finally unwarranted and unwanted nihilism and that s just the plot the majority of the new faces are as frivolous and poorly developed as the movie one particularly flat character ends up hogging half the time we spend with the infamous henry fool himself and it s his only spoken scene in the film jeff goldblum s agent fulbright it seems is the only bright character a pun surely intended by hartley as well how then is he left spoiler dead via a car bombing easily making this the gentle natured hartley s most violent film to date and tonally all wrong in a film that s already all wrong from the word go as for the other new characters angus james ned fool or is it grim not to mention fay herself well i won t spoil their fates as the movie does a good enough job of that all on its own when it isn t busying itself with yet another godawful canted angle which gives the disconcerting impression that hartley is moving backwards from auteur to crappy film student this piece is a complete disaster a dreadful mess that isn t even good humored enough to revel in its messiness instead it self indulgently crams the typically fun hipster pretenses of its director into the real world one uglier and meaner than it need be but not nearly ugly or mean enough to come close to having anything to say in doing so hartley tracks sh t all over my memories of these people and the marvelous world he originally created for them i have rarely been so depressed at the movies and i m counting leaving las vegas which at least developed fresh new characters we grew to love before destroying them instead of immediately disregarding characters already beloved grim indeed
i like the cast pretty much however the story sort of unfolds rather slowly danny glover does a good job making you wonder if he s the bad guy meanwhile the other characters are just part of the story dennis quaid didn t have as much room in the story as he could have had i thought the first scene was a bit over the top grim compared to how the story unfolded i d watch it again though i rated it a wish i could rate it a
after eight moto films the series had run its course as this last entry demonstrates peter lorre was clearly weary of trying to pump some sort of human interest and entertainment value into the wispy character of moto and the dreadful idea of pairing him with a funny british sidekick utterly defeats all his efforts here
the movie confuses religious ethics and ideals so much that it fails to create coherent argument against the death penalty on any level by presenting the lawful execution of a convicted murder as the catalyst for the apocalyptic end of mankind the movie elevates a parent killer to the status of martyr for christ somehow according to the plot god is outraged that society has chosen to rid it s self of a fanatic who killed his own parents by starting them on fire while they slept defenselessly in their beds yet this same god has no indignation for the acts of the killer the lead character an nonreligious pregnant suicidal woman ultimately gives her own life in a defiant but implausible attempt to unsuccessfully save this convicted killer in other threads of the underdeveloped plot jesus comes back as a powerless and frustrated vagabond to symbolically unleash the wrath of god the modern lackluster incarnation of christ not just dehumanizes him but mocks the messianic ideal of all religions as well he is unable to affect humanity for good and unemotionally skates the edges of life waiting for mankind to destroy it s self meanwhile with little help from jesus the mentally unstable pregnant woman finds herself with the ability to reincarnate herself into her newly born soulless child which somehow saves all of mankind from the wrath of the almighty i also interpreted that as a statement in support of abortion on some levels this movie which attempts to weave many religious themes into a thriller fails to make any religious point that i could clearly interpret except to mock people s beliefs it raises many questions that it never even attempts to answer it disregards the religious values of its audience while attempting to portray an asinine version of their fulfillment silly
believe it or not this movie is worse than number three it s slower the acting is worse and the story is very weak there isn t a lot of good to say about this movie even the fight scenes are more dull than number three and i would have thought that impossible this is a very slow minutes painful in fact i stuck it through hoping it would get better if you really want to see this movie you should try to find a cheap rental of it it is hard to find for purchase that is and probably for good reason like number three this movie has nothing to do with the first two it is the same in name only anyway the most i can give best of the best without warning is
stereotypical send up of slasher flicks falls far short as supposed entertainment gerrit graham michael lerner zane busby and in fact the entire cast are totally wasted lame jokes abound and every punch line is well telegraphed the dumb one liners come at a fast pace and almost every one falls flat as a squashed grape the musical numbers only contribute to the boredom that sets in and lingers for the entire movie another negative is the claustrophobic setting entirely within the walls of an abandoned high school avoid this and seek out one of lampoon s truly funny films like national lampoon s golddiggers merk
this post contains spoiler s i m not a big fan of chuck norris as an actor but i worship him in all other ways he also have his own fan web site with chuck norris facts that is really entertaining but this movie looks like someone was joking with the audience putting all those facts into one movie i really don t remember when i wasted my time more than with this action i don t know what s the worst this movie can offer you unoriginal and thousand times made plot of terrorists who are trying to nuke us by smuggling nuke on us soil or perhaps that great dialogs and chucks words of wisdom about life and everything else someone may find the worst that terrorists actually speak english in everyday life it s a never ending list of crap not to mention huge amount of archive footage used in film that is kinda annoying the chief terrorist send his comrades message through the media when he is captured and the only guy smart enough to see the treat is chuck norris of course no one else in america is not smart enough to see that and the whole action in capturing chief is just ridiculous one man is sent to walk through a whole terrorist camp unarmed i m lying he had a knife escapes his stalkers with jet pack and then para glides for few hundred maybe even thousand kilometers to nearest shore afganistan border is km far away from nearest shore where he is rescued by submarine i hoped that at least fighting scenes will be good but that s even more funny than the plot if you didn t know of terrorist are masters of some martial art but chuck and co beat the sh t out of them not only they kill them easily they can kick and throw them away by a single move and the bad guys fly few meters like dolls you may ask me did i watch this movie to the end i did why because i just wanted to see who of these two super heroes will defuse the nuclear bomb of few hundred megatons and size of a microwave and then i realized what fool i am of course it s chuck s movie after all and not only he singlehandedly defuse nuke with tweezers but he do it twice i could write a book about all the stupid things in this movie but i would spend my life spawn so makers of this movie made another chuck norris fact to be added on his web site can chuck norris defuse nuclear bomb yes and he can do it twice
i saw this hot movie when it came out in it had a x rating for a brief scene involving oral sex but played in mainstream theatres it was an art film supposedly it s the first film to ever show a respected actress in an explicit sex scene what i saw was a boring tale about a high school boy federico pitzalis in love understandably with an older woman maruschka detmers as has been mentioned before detmers is very beautiful with a good body but she also gave a very good performance pitzalis was to put it mildly pretty poor it s no wonder he never made another movie still despite the infamous sex scene which is explicit but pretty brief this a slow moving dull story which bored me silly the good acting by detmers only helped to a certain point mostly i was looking at my watch waiting patiently for it to end if it didn t have that sequence this movie would have been forgotten long ago dull and slow you can skip this one
this film is pretty awful the only thing stopping me from giving it a rating of was the fact that i unfortunately have seen worse the jungle music juttering demons and fluorescent uv style blood teeth eyes give it that awful look and the script is dire this film is more like a test to see how long you can last before giving up on it it s also predictable but not in a good way nothing this film does is in a good way i watched it minutes ago and thought i would rant a bit so there you are oh and the acting doesn t let the film down it s also terrible
this movie is awful at the end of it you will realize that several hours have been stolen from your life that you can t get back the twist ending is very contrived the character development leading up to this ending is not consistent with their final actions at the conclusion ninety minutes of preparation with the premise that the rob lowe character will die on christmas eve is explained away in literally ninety seconds of no we were just tricking you then the rob lowe character is not even upset about it i will forgive you if you can forgive me is as upset as he gets if someone took weeks to convince me i was about to die and then said no sorry just fooling you i would raise some serious hell i don t feel bad about giving away the spoiler because i might be able to save some of you out there from watching please save yourself and don t watch this movie
i went to see this a few days ago and it s hard to forget that film for the wrong reasons this film is supposed to be funny it s not not a single laugh in the theatre perhaps for jos garcia and g rard depardieu and it s boring boring boring it was even hard sometimes to understand what they were saying they just talk to fast and don t open their enough for us to understand i was with a friend and more than or times i caught myself saying after a line that was supposed to be funny what what did he say and i m french i hate to say that given the fact that i think good films are made here but i apologise in advance for all foreigners who will go see the film if ever shown outside of france we re deeply sorry for that cr p
maiden voyage is just that i d like to say straight away that i watched mins of this before i just couldn t stand it anymore as already stated in another comment this film doesn t fall into the whole so bad it s good thing it s just bad the acting is awful the sfx are poor and the story is bland and stupid even the extras suck the bag guy guards and such appear to hold their weapons like water pistols don t even bother watching this film the only thing special about it is that no matter how low your expectations are you will still be disappointed
up until this new season i have been a big little mosque fan however the new season had absolutely ruined it the new christian vicar has destroyed the entire intent of the show it has always been about living together to overcome prejudice the new vicar ruins that premise and shows christians in a very bad light i am neither christian or muslim but loved watching the show and seeing the camaraderie between amar and the reverend not any more just cancel it and be done with it it s not worth watching any more it might still be saved but a lot of change would need to be made bring back the old format
a rating of does not begin to express how dull depressing and relentlessly bad this movie is
what is left of planet earth is populated by a few poor and starving rag tag survivors they must eat bugs and insects or whatever after a poison war or something has nearly wiped out all human civilization in these dark times one of the few people on earth still able to live in comfort we will call him the all knowing big boss has a great quest to prevent some secret spore seeds from being released into the air it seems that the all knowing big boss is the last person on earth that knows that these spores even exist the spores are located far away from any living soul and they are highly protected by many layers of deadly defense systems the all knowing big boss wants the secret spores to remain in their secret protected containers so he makes a plan to send in a macho action team to remove the spore containers from all of the protective systems and secret location sending people to the location of secret spores makes them no longer a secret sending people to disable all of the protective systems makes it possible for the spores to be easily released into the air how about letting sleeping dogs lie the one pleasant feature of encrypt is the radiant and elegant vivian wu as the unremarkable macho action team members drop off with mechanically paced predictable timing engaging vivian wu s charm makes acceptable the plot idea of her old employer wanting her so much she is an object of love an object of desire a very believable concept fans of vivian wu may want to check out an outstanding b movie she is in from a couple years back called dinner rush dinner rush is highly recommended encrypt is not
i have never understood the appeal of this show the acting is poor debra jo rupp being a notable exception the plots of most episodes are trite and uninspiring the dialogue is weak the jokes unfunny and it is painful to try and sit through even half an episode furthermore the link between this show and the s is extremely tenuous beyond the style of dress and the scenery and background used for the show it seems to be nothing more than a modern sitcom with the same old unfunny clich d scripts that modern sitcoms have dressed up as depicting a show from twenty years ago in the hope that it will gain some nostalgic viewers or something like that both happy days and the wonder years employ the same technique much more effectively and are actually a pleasure to watch in contrast to this horrible pathetic excuse for a show
i actually have a fondness for christopher lee but this just wasn t up to his other performances and he was one of the better actors the film does not live up to its premise it s not that scary it s overly melodramatic and it draaaaaags every time i thought oh here comes the good part the good part never quite arrived the evil ones aren t at all convincing most of the other characters were also lacking in depth perhaps if i d been in the proper frame of mind i might have enjoyed some mstie fication at this film s expense but naaahhh didn t really seem to be worth the effort it wasn t really very good it wasn t really very bad it was just mediocre
a man discovers that his parents were part of a nuclear experiment in the s and that he now has the power to burst into flames i was really geared up for this film what with being directed by the great toby hooper and staring wild card brad dourif unfortunately it didn t rise above the average individual with violent powers movie spontaneous combustion has an interesting premise behind it unfortunately it never seems to live up to its potential and prolongs its plot too much the special effects aren t bad though and help to carry the movie to the finale the cast isn t bad dourif does steal the show all around no classic but it s not the worst of its kind either out of
first let s all agree that lorenzo lamas could never be considered a skilled actor barely even decent sometimes just plain lousy however in this piece of called snakeeater the film industry as a whole sank first let s start with the plot a vietnam vet named jack kelly aka soldier who is supposed to be as tough as a strap of leather and then some which you can believe when he shoves a palate of nails through guys feet and pins them to the floor gets word that his family has been killed and his sister kidnapped therefore he goes on a solo mission to save his sister had some potential but still pretty thin to begin with now the acting being an actor myself i am qualified to say that this was some of the worst acting in the history of the art lamas is well himself the jackasses playing the clampets deliverance rejects should be strung up and shot for their so called performances which are insulting to actors everywhere especially talented ones who never get their big break finally the action the gunfighting is so so at best and the fist fighting is deplorable i ve seen more real looking fights at the renaissance festival and those were pretty fake looking readers listen to me avoid this piece of caca at all costs if it were the only film in existence you still would want to avoid it for the sake of your brain cell count do not watch this thing
let me start out by saying that i used to really like betty grable particularly from down argentine way but by the time she got around to this disaster she had also got round and frankly the whole film was an embarrassment costarred with douglas fairbanks jnr who must have been fairly desperate the story was bad the colours good and the film far too long it had some of the old standbys in it like harry davenport and reginald gardiner to try and stimulate interest but with no success the music score was woeful and i have to say not one tune was memorable in any way as i was such a fan of miss grable i always wish i had never seen this one
tyson aspect ratio sound format stereoreverent though scrupulously fair account of the life and times of champion boxer mike tyson given his conviction on a rape charge the film is careful not to portray him as hero or villain but paints a warts and all portrait of his rise to fame the pressures of success and the people who shaped his destiny for good or bad constrained by time limits the script gallops through a succession of relevant details alighting briefly on significant events culminating with tyson s temporary downfall in novices will be enlightened by the chronology while boxing fans will be entertained by director uli edel s straight arrow approach to the material he portrays tyson s life as a circus in which he was ultimately led astray by the circumstances of his own success in fact the script reserves most of its venom for tyson s ex wife robin givens characterising her as an ungrateful gold digger who took advantage of his naivety production values are uniformly solid and the cast is superb michael jai white does a fair imitation of the title character george c scott plays tyson s mentor cus d amato through acres of gritted teeth and paul winfield was surely born to play don king
sorry my fellow nevada city neighbors but this one is bad brian must have had too much botox because he had very little facial expressions through out the entire movie alice looked like she had a board strapped to her backside she was stiff throughout the movie i looked up both alice and brian and was surprised to see the extensive bio of work i would have guessed that they were first year students ed asner and peter jason carried the movie frankly with their banter and ease with every line ed certainly has not lost his charisma i wish i d taken the time to meet him while he was here i love the snow scenes and scenes of stores and the church because i ve been there i make nevada city my home and was anxiously awaiting the premiere i was sadly disappointed sorry
tom is listening to one of those old time radio broadcasts something kids from the s to today would watch on tv however they didn t television when this cartoon was made so people got their entertainment from comedies to music to scary stories from the radio tom is literally shaking in his boots listening to some story about the phantom he s actually literally doing everything the narrator is saying such as hair standing on end icy chills race down her spine her heart beats in her throat etc jerry meanwhile is watching tom and laughing his butt off at his scaredy cat antics we then get a taste of what we will see for many years after this cartoon in which jerry tortures tom for no reason other than sadistic pleasure if the cat asks for trouble that s one thing but when he s minding own business and jerry is physically and in this case mentally abusing him i have a hard time rooting for the little guy these early t m efforts also were a minute longer than all that followed sometimes that one minute makes a difference it did here as this actually dragged for awhile it could have been cut to five minutes without missing anything because the sketches went on too long that s usual for tom and jerry s usually they are much faster paced
the only redeeming quality of this overlong miscast melodrama is the scenery of southern france and the voice of nana mascouri singing the theme song stephanie powers is miscast and betrayed by a phony accent as has been pointed out she is too old to play an year old and looks far too young as a grandmother with a college age granddaughter lee remick is good although she also is ageless in her later years the talented joanna lumley is under utilized and also manages to look forever young when her middle aged son robert urich finally marries grandma stephanie powers stacey keach s ceaseless arrogance makes you wonder what these women saw in him don t know how any viewer could relate to his excessive portrayal the most credible performance is given by ian richardson who makes the rest of the cast look like rank amateurs it strains credulity that the handsome male suitors in this epic would remain ever single while they patiently await the subject of their affections to finally consent to accept them can anybody believe that handsome robert urich would remain single for decades waiting for stephanie powers to finally accept his endless marriage proposals the ww engagement between the wehrmacht and the marquis is laughable to begin with the germans did not occupy the provence section of france until late in the war it was controlled by the vichy french puppet government we see the french resistance staging a daylight raid on mistral s villa to steal sheets after which they all lounge under a bridge waiting for a lumbering truckload of nazi troops to surprise and annihilate them if you want to see a well acted mini series set in a foreign country don t watch mistral s daughter a far better alternative would be the thorn birds
seeing a photo of a man being attacked by zombies gave me hope that lucio zombi fulci might be up to his old tricks unfortunately other than the close ups of a rotting corpse there s little to recommend in this story of the murder of a wealthy man and his daughter s quest to figure out who killed him none of the characters are appealing and by the time you find out how they did it that twist at least was cool you stop caring the only good thing i can say is that it made more sense than nightmare concert
look carefully at the wonderful assortment of talent put together to make this movie connery fishburne capshaw harris underwood beatty thigpen even cameos by slezak lange and plimpton they prove in spades the adage that a good cast cannot save a bad script the story line requires so many leaps of faith from the audience that its implausibility should have exceeded even hollywood standards it s not particularly original and the twists are downright cruel
the greatest sin in life is being dull and this movie is crashingly boring its funny its left out of his a life in film documentary he goes from a long piece on stardust memories and then fast forwards to zelig this little piece of cubic zirconia just isn t worth the effort
after sitting through this pile of dung my husband and i wondered whether it was actually the product of an experiment to see whether a computer program could produce a movie it was that listless and formulaic but the u s propaganda thrown in your face throughout the film proves disappointingly that it s the work of humans call me a conspiracy theorist but quotes like we have to steal the declaration of independence to protect it seem like ways to justify actions like the invasion of iraq etc the fact that nicholas cage spews lines like i would never use the declaration of independence as a bargaining chip with a straight face made me and my husband wonder whether the entire cast took valium before shooting each scene the reasoning behind each plot turn and new clue is truly ridiculous and impossible to follow and there s also a bonus side plot of misogyny with dr whatever her name was being chided by all involved for never shutting up she s clearly in the movie only for looks but they felt the need to slap a dr title on her character to give her some gravity at one point cage s character says don t you ever shut up and the camera pans to her looking poutily down at her hands like she s a child truly grotesque the only benefit to this movie was that it s so astonishingly bad you do get a few laughs out of it the really scary thing is that a majority of the people watching the movie with us seemed to enjoy it creepy
deceptive advertising i saw a commercial for carlitos way rise to power that states from the producer of scarface and carlito s way lets get it straight michael bergman did not produce scarface in fact he was editing room assistant for scarface not to take away from bergman s talent but in my opinion he should of had a little more class i think i can speak for the masses when i say we hate being blatantly lied to as far as the movie goes it was poor at best i did think puff daddy did a good job although luis guzman should be ashamed for working on this film overall this film did not do a good job filling in the blanks for carlito s way it s obvious this project was an attempt to make a quick buck rather a good film
labored comedy has i r s agent tony randall investigating eccentric farm family in maryland who have never paid their taxes debbie reynolds is the tomboy farmer s daughter who puts the squeeze on the not so disinterested tax man debbie certainly made her share of inferior theatrical sitcoms during this period and this one s no better or worse than the rest picture begins brightly but flags at the halfway point becoming frantic and witless randall isn t a bad match for reynolds but the vehicle itself defeats the chemistry based on the novel the darling buds of may by h e bates with a poor sound mix causing all the actors to sound as if they re stuck in an echo chamber from
this program is really overrated a detective like danny pino s hot headed character would have been transferred to the rubber gun squad years ago the whole squad is made up of sanctimonious egomaniacs who judge people whose actions go back decades by the standards of every vietnam veteran character they ve ever had has turned out to be the killer unless it was another vietnam veteran there has only been one black murderer and he was put up to it by his white boss the only hispanic killer was a race traitor who killed another hispanic to frame a hispanic street kid for a crime that naturally two rich white kids committed what a bunch of propaganda hey screenwriters minorities and poor people commit murder too only on this show are most murderers upper class whites what s more the arrests of people in their s s and s for crimes they committed years ago are a joke no real life da will push for murder one because it means the state will be stuck with their humongous medical bills until they finally kick the state would be doing their families and insurance companies a favor the prosecutor will just plead them to involuntary manslaughter and they won t serve a day the only really old criminals who go to prison are either organized crime figures or ex nazis whose high profile convictions boost da s careers
well i just gave away minutes and seconds that i ll never get back on this piece of trash i heard someone online describe this movie s villains as subhuman cannibals and i thought it was promising because i thought it would be like the descent wrong the descent was a psychological thriller with dynamic characters and strong storyline these villains are totally unrealistic and no part of their performance is enjoyable to watch this movie isn t so controversial i ve seen this level of gore in many films this movie plain sucks synopsis a blonde who thinks she s real hot but she isn t her admirer and her admirer s friend no i don t remember their names go into the woods their car breaks down they are warned to leave by a man named mark the blonde gets unreasonably hysterical and the next morning they can t find the admirer s friend admirer impales his foot whoops don t worry he is much more upset when his car won t start than when he gets impaled by nails after a nanosecond of coaxing the blond leaves to find help events ensue that i cannot remember during this and throughout the movie we are shown grotesque torture scenes with no substance including one that made me gag blonde goes to save admirer from house of cannibals even though all they are seen eating is intestines which would logically be the last choice for real cannibals to eat since they contain actual food blonde finds admirer hurt and works very hard unsuccessfully to work up tears then you get a good laugh when the blonde is in the house and announces she can out think them mark the man who warned them to leave has a remarkable change of character when he reveals the cannibals are his family then there is some shooting they leave the house the shooting continues then a random guy shows up and says he s been watching them before he is shot we are shown an acid trip inspired scene of more killing the blonde or her admirer shoots him because he did not help them there s more killing the admirer professes his love for the blonde then a mysterious hand covers the camera what does that imply i don t know hopefully not a sequel
this kind of storytelling is unacceptable the only reason this film is anywhere above the stars out of line is because it s got george lucas behind it and it has the words star and wars in its title that is an insult to aspiring filmmakers and many others out there who have made clearly superior films with superior story writing and acting but did not get the credit this is a travesty first things first the story anakin s evolution there is none apart from a little make up around the eyes and a little yelling there is none he becomes young stupid cocky anakin skywalker to darth vader in a single blow the only thing consistent about darth vader in the original series was his intelligence how good he was at almost everything he did planning fighting you name it the only consistent thing about anakin that is perceived in the prequel trilogy is his consistent stupidity he even loses his body because of a bout of stupid cockiness what part of the emperor palpatine telling him legends of the sith does not point to the emperor being a sith unacceptable the fight scenes used too many digital doubles everyone s flying all over the place like teddy bears in a make believe doll house count dooku emperor palpatine anakin obi wan almost every fighter had a rubbery digital double jumping around in one specific fight scene obi wan and anakin in the climactic battle they both actually stop in the middle of parries and ripostes to twirl their sabers a few times while inches apart i realize the fights are choreographed but that just got me shaking my head in disbelief and disgust the writing was awful all the dialogue was of tremendously low quality the good actors like ewan mcgregor and natalie portman did the best they could with their lines but that just wasn t enough i can t say enough bad things about this film too much special effects plot holes bigger than the centre of the universe and absolutely no insights into any of the characters this is the biggest mistake of this film nothing new is offered we know the rough picture of everything all lucas did was colour it in we knew anakin lost his limbs we knew luke and leia are brother and sister we knew luke is anakin s son we knew obi wan and yoda go to exile we knew everything nothing new is offered in this film if that s all the fans wanted then that s fine lucas couldn t have gone wrong but when anakin finally becomes darth vader and he asks after padme and hears she is dead he reaches out his arms awkwardly and screams nooooooooooooooooooooo that scene screamed b movie all the way and i was half expecting darth vader to go danger will robinson danger at any time that is what this is a b movie disguised by a huge budget and a ultra loyalist fan base that will settle with anything now that the first two movies have pulled their standards down to the pits of the earth
ghost of dragstrip hollow is a typical s teens in turmoil movie it is not a horror or science fiction movie plot concerns a group of teens who are about to get kicked out of their hot rod club because they cannot meet the rent once kicked out they decide to try an old haunted house the only saving grace for the film is that the ghost paul blaisdell in the she creature suit turns out to be an out of work movie monster played by blaisdell
for the record this film is intriguing but its hardly original back in a movie starring talia shire called the landlady had almost the exact same plot but with younger characters the story is amanda lear has had a bad life abusive father horny doctor mental homes etc she s finally released from the happy home under the guidance of her perverted doctor who she anally abuses and kills the poor guy now that was original the doctor had financed a mansion for her before she killed him and buried the sucker in the backyard after moving in she falls in love with a stud named richard who just happens to be married to a blues singer if you ve seen the landlady you know the rest she kills or tries to kill anyone that gets in between her and richard including a roadie much of the idea s came from the previous movie same idiot sidekick that sticks his nose in same spying on the guy with a bowl of popcorn same flying a bodypress it did have some original material the beer bottle thing was brutal the highlight of the movie was amanda s beautiful breasts in the hot top scene somewhat of a ripoff but not a total waste of time out of
this movie is spoofed in an episode of mystery science theater i think mst k was at its best when they ripped this movie terrible acting bad makeup poor effects chick in skimpy s underwear i give it a the villain is hard to understand due to the makeup the assistant says things like not you that sound like nachoo think sneezing it s just poor oration the long eyebrows are hilarious on one of the characters i still don t know what the projected man means in terms of the plot i missed some of the beginning though what is up with this line minimum on posting
one missed call another asian horror based on the cell phone i recently rented a korean horror film based on a cell phone called pon one missed call was just as boring as that one maybe phones just aren t scary or something but this move was dull and drab no tension or thrills for me and the final monster was disappointingly cheesy and unscary the movie dragged quite a bit in different parts and felt too long didn t keep my attention it seems phones are hard to make frightening it s kind of like trying to make a pop vending machine eerie and it is ridiculous to compare this with the ring it seems every asian horror movie is compared to it and so far i haven t seen any that measure up in the least to horror directors take the phone off the hook as a horror device
i was aware of rohmer s admiration for the late works of the ones he considered like great cineasts and that normal spectators generally considered as artistic failures as renoir s or chaplin s very last movies yes the politique des auteurs also has its dark side but with les amours d astr e et de c ladon it s as if rohmer himself wanted for what may be his last movie to perpetuate this tradition of great directors who made a last senile movie by adapting urf s l astr e with ridiculous aesthetic codes witch just look like a parody of rosselini s last movies the ones he made for tv from descartes or marx s lives in his version of perceval rohmer refused to film real landscapes in order to give a re transcription of what may have been a middle age classical representation of things the director apparently changed his mind when the xvii century is involved and films actors dressed like s peasants reciting their antic text surrounded by contemporary trees and landscapes but the all thing looks even more ridiculous than luchini and its fake trees it s not that the story itself is stupid but the way rohmer mixes naturalism with artifices seems so childish and amateurism that it rapidly becomes involuntarily funny and i m not even talking about the irritating pronunciation of the actors the annoying and sad humorist tries by rodolphe pauly the ridiculous soft erotic tone the poor musical tentatives or the strange fascination for trasvestisment the radical aesthetic of the film ultimately makes it looks like a joke which mixes a soft erotic movie made for tv with theological scholastic discussions sic at the beginning of the movie rohmer teaches us that the original french region of the story is now disfigured by modernity and that s why he had to film l astr e in other parts of the country however i m sure the movie would have look more modern and interesting if rohmer would have actually still filmed the same story in a modern area with same narrative codes and artistically decisions this film may interest a few historians but most of the cinephiles may laugh at this last and sad rohmer s movie
this is a badly made poor remake of bimalda s classic parineeta the story is based on sarat chandra s book of the same name and it is a distortion of the original well one can appreciate some degree of creativity but not sham creativity the acting by everyone is affected and the entire movie is a sham shekar s father s choice of words in abusing lolita balan sounds cheap and morbid and destroys the spirit of the original story again the scene where shekhar saif slaps lolita is quite out of place with the flow of the movie and the characters is quite jarring to the senses and could have been easily avoided similarly the sex scene between saif and balan is quite unbecoming the movie and a cheap gimmick to attract the audience when a creative work is not faithful to the original and destroys it s spirit the work falls apart the song piyu bole is quite ok another silver lining in the dark cloud of this movie is the scene where saif stands up for himself and rebels against his father this is a positive departure from the original and deserves credit on these counts this movie deserves stars the song and dance by rekha smacks of artifice and it is a put on the song is tuneful but i remember having heard it somewhere before and if iam not mistaken the tune appears to have been plagiarized well agreed the times have changed from then to now but then this movie is not even reflective of the modern times this is what happens when the modern bollywood film makers get increasingly obsessed with impressing the nris and grabbing the lucrative nri entertainment market such movies end up neither belonging to india nor to any other part of the world
i have just watched the movie for the first time i wanted to watch it as i like drew barrymore and wanted to see one of her early movies the movie is about a girl played by young and beautiful drew barrymore who moves from nyc to la in order to get over her recently troubled loss short after moving to a guy who falls in love with her it becomes obvious that she has an evil twin doppelganger who haunts her the movie is quite poor and lousy both the dialogs and the acting make the film not really worth seeing it summing up it is just something for the fans of drew barrymore
i didn t even bother finishing the movie because i was so bored i thought i was going to pass out i was watching it in the movie theaters and me and my friends just got tired so we got up and left to another movie if i ever have to sit through min of that movie again i think i m going to shoot myself and i do know the whole entire movie because my friend told me what happened at the end and i wasn t surprised at all i mean who didn t know she was going to do the right thing and let him be happy i mean for real you would have to be a complete idiot not to know that i know i didn t miss anything and if somebody ask s me to see that movie i would say over my dead body
no just kidding it was god awful i was watching my local sci fi station last night which plays movies every night within a monthly theme this month it s space turkeys or how i learned to stop worrying and love the bombs movies so bad they should never have been made this was a good selection everything about this movie is thoroughly horrible with two exceptions the gore make up which showed potential and the editing which slightly out did the rest of the movie in terms of being horrible the acting is horrible all around the dialog is horrible the script the direction it s not a good movie it consists of two forms of special effects gore and stock footage of space i ll focus on the gore watching this movie i thought to myself what was the motivation behind the making of this movie people like making stuff sure but i was hesitant to think anything good could have come of it for anyone involved i came to the conclusion that this movie was made as a means to increase the make up effects guy s demo reel he rick baker actually went on to a pretty nice career he s worked on star wars king kong men in black and even the incredible shrinking woman plus a number of other notable flicks other than that i can t say i ve ever actually seen a real live melting man incredible or otherwise but i d have to say this seemed to be a fair representation of one now when i think of bad editing i usually think of maybe a scene where someone s talking on the phone and then in the middle of the scene the phone jumps down to his shoulder or something to that effect this movie really serves to highlighted the fact that bad editing can take many forms specifically over long and utterly useless scenes just about every scene dragged on longer than it should have from a little bit of dead air to that crazy long screaming scene with cleaver girl and that severed head in the river the head gets thrown into a river in slow motion the movie carries on for a couple minutes and then we cut back to the floating head and watch it fall down a waterfall while i m sure they were all very proud of their severed head what the hell lastly i ll mention the running fat lady slow motion scene right near the beginning the jerky slow motion tells me that they didn t shoot the scene in slow motion originally but later decided that it wasn t working like that and then slowed it down oy vey in any event if you should ever see another movie in which a hysterical fat woman runs down a hall and then directly through a closed glass door all in slow motion mind you remember the incredible melting man for this is where it all started movies like this are best viewed at home with a bunch of friends this one s a little slow most of the time but that s just all the more time to come up with your own one liners it s not the worst of the worst but it s pretty freaking bad
ivan valeri nikolayev is a bitter cynical journalist who investigates the unexplained he travels to this small town where it s said that a witch ita ever is terrorizing the community his car stalls and he takes refuge in a small building and meets a beautiful mysterious girl suddenly she turns into a demon and he kills her and the town is wondering who murdered this woman who i guess was the witch but i am not entirely sure ivan is now being pursued by her spirit or something and he has to have faith or something to beat it i really hate christian films they are usually filled with lame actors stupid storyline and minimal effects not to mention that this isn t just a christian film but a foreign one as well the voice over actor for ivan made the movie more comical than terrorizing because it is so high pitched and whiny you won t miss much by missing out on this film
the people who are praising this film are the real disappointments i am hoping at least that leonard will see some good out of this as his life savings were embezzled away by a manager a couple of years ago and he s over now but this film is simply terrible at the beginning leonard himself says he is not sentimental about his past and then for the next hour and a half the film emphasizes all the worst sentimental elements of leonard s songs it is so bloody precious with its endless close ups of over emoting singers cohen s interview is all done in lo fi video closeups and i so wanted to see a medium or a long shot of his whole body i couldn t care less about the comments of the performers especially those overblown ego boys edge and bono none of the performers in this film have done even one song as good as leonard s own music and if you are thinking about seeing this and you have any doubts at all heed them this would be an acceptable pbs special maybe for a one time showing but i will even hesitate at getting a dvd of this when the film finally shows leonard semi performing tower of song it s ruined by bono taking a verse even the occasional good performances antony rufus first number martha s the traitor are spoiled by the context of the rest of this turgid blabla forget this one and go buy leonard s most recent album if you want to pay tribute to him
there have been so many many films based on the same theme single cute girl needs handsome boy to impress ex pays him and then guess what she falls in love with him there s a bit of fumbling followed by a row before everyone makes up before the happy ending this has been done many times the thing is i knew this before starting to watch but despite this i was still looking forward to it in the right hands with a good cast and a bright script it can still be a pleasant way to pass a couple of hours this was none of these this was dire a female lead lacking in charm or wit who totally failed to light even the slightest spark in me i truly did not care if she got her man or remained single and unhappy a male lead who after a few of his endless words of wisdom i wanted to kill just to remove that smug look i had no idea that leading a life of a male whore was the path to all seeing all knowing enlightenment a totally unrealistic film filled with unrealistic characters none of them seemed to have jobs all of them had more money than sense a bridegroom who still goes ahead with his wedding after learning that his bride slept with his best friend plus i would miss you even if we had never met i could go on but i have just realised that i am wasting even more time on this dross i could rant about introducing a character just to have a very cheap laugh at the name woody but in truth that was the only remotely humorous thing that happened in the film
i ve seen about movies released between and the informer is the worst major release i ve seen from that time span awful despicable unpleasant unhappy unredeemable saga of a complete loser watch a b western instead
spoilers galore this is an absolutely awful film first of all it has that guy from medium i guess he s made a career out of playing super doting dads it was ok the first time he tried to scare his son by pretending to be a monster but then minutes later they cloyingly did it again and so it goes this film moves in excruciating real time at one point i started imaging it was days later until i was reminded that the story line was only at the next day in the early afternoon still i m not really sure who this couple is supposed to be in real life first of all they are presented as sort of a manhattan yuppie couple who grew up and had a kid but they drive an old blue volvo those types stopped driving volvos decades ago today they drive priuses but in i m sure they still weren t driving volvos ok then there s wendigo a mysterious indian man gives the boy a little magic wendigo statue and tells him of its powerful magic c mon are we still doing ancient indian mysteries just to drive it home they pan across every indian statue in their tourist trap upstate new york town american indians are portrayed in a manner not seen for decades in this film oh and about wendigo he is not actually the cause of the horror he doesn t kill the kid s dad which is the most horrible thing in the film he s just killed by an ordinary hick with a grudge and a high powered rifle the wendigo only comes out late in the film to avenge the guy who killed the dad oh but wait it seemed earlier that wendigo was kind of mad at the dad maybe because he killed a deer so then wendigo must have been happy that the dad was killed but and so it goes insulting boring and nonsensical there is no reason to watch this film at all
a surprising misfire from the usually reliable larry cohen god told me too q etc full moon high tries so hard to be funny and fails miserably even with decent turns by ed mcmahon and kenneth mars alan arkin looks embarrassed throughout his performance and son adam simply looks numb this makes teen wolf look like a comedy classic
this norwegian movie is so crap the actors can not act cause they seems to be reading from a book and the story is so wannabe hollywood the only actor who did a ok job was haavard lilleheie if you want a really good norwegian movie watch buddy great actors and a feelgood story
think a darker version of one of those kid shows such as power rangers and you have this film from robot jox a movie where you fight with giant robots two men enter the arena and whoever comes out their country wins the robots are huge and look like slightly better versions of the ones from said shows mainly because they are less colorful so while this movie is not good it isn t all bad to watch there are as i recall two robot fights in this one one that ends badly and the final showdown there is a plot twist part way through as a traitor is revealed but in the end the plot is nothing that is going to stick with you for any amount of time after the picture is done the fights themselves look like giant toys on the rampage but still somewhat fun to watch this movie would also spawn a couple of other films with similar plot devices such as the giant robots and the tournament so it is worth checking out once but probably not more than that
spoilers in this rosenstra e is a movie about heroic women in german nazi time but it is way too long it is not touching and sometimes even boring there are too many clich s and not enough good acting the storytelling storyline is bad like in james cameron s titanic an old woman remembers events of her live good now we ve got a point of view than there is another woman introduced who does the same confusing is that they both are recalling events of lifes of other people come on this is a lack of knowledge of basic story telling how can riemann know about the fate of the little girl s mother and her interrogation for example the scenes are shown in the wrong order and you rarely know when it took place for example the scene when riemann is proposing to fabian when did that happen the scene looks like it is set in the twenties riemann s character is of course a talented pianist well she is even a baroness wow her brother comes back from the eastern front he has received a ritterkreuz which he is showing in some scenes so he is a war hero and still a fine man who preserved his conscience and he gained knowledge of massacres committed by germans he even made some photographs and so it goes clich after clich is piling up and this is why the movie does not work basically von trotta made a chick flick out of something what could have been a decent movie and in the end it s all very simple riemann finds a way to get goebbels into bed and ta da everyone is free which is not a historical fact but pure imagination despite the true story claim at the beginning like sass it is vaguely based on a true event it is sad but true this is the typical german movie these days it is bad macaulay j connor
i sought out this film for one reason al adamson he is among the worst directors of all time right up there with ed wood jr and ray dennis steckler and the pantheon of awfulness however i was a tad disappointed because although the film was indeed bad it never approached the levels of awfulness of some of his earlier schlocky movies because of that this film wasn t particularly fun to watch for us bad movie fans now i was wary about watching this film as the title naughty stewardesses makes the film sound like a pornographic film something i wouldn t be reviewing on imdb however this film appeared to be this at times particularly the first minutes but you could tell that the script underwent many changes as for much of the film there isn t any titillation at all and towards the end of the movie there is a plot that comes out of no where that is violent and certainly not sexy the result of all this is total confusion sadly none of the many parts are even good for example as a porn video it shows surprisingly little and it s incomprehensible why they would put a year old guy in some of the love scenes sure for a year old mr livingston looked pretty good but he was still an old man and no one would want to see him getting it on with young nymphet then when the final minutes becomes very violent as livingston became a rambo like guy talk about weird and inappropriate overall there is little to recommend this sad movie it s not bad enough or sexy enough to care about and the film manages to be rather boring even with such a crazy title like naughty stewardesses
i was very disappointed in this movie plotwise it was weak bordering on silly souls who can affect reality in the way they do a mission apparently critical to the soul hunters entrusted to one of their younger members and the whole b story with the holobrothel and the lawsuit against the station was so awful that at one point i blurted out to the television why are you wasting my time with this thematically river of souls didn t really go into the question of the soul in any more depth than the original episode soul hunter did we see that soul hunters can make mistakes but we still don t get a feeling for their culture are there any female soul hunters the acting was okay given the material they had to work with and the special effects especially the planetscapes in the first act were very impressive but overall i d say give this one a miss
ok how s this for original this mean rich old geezer leaves his estate to his adult children all of them ungrateful losers and two creepy servants provided they spend the week in his spooky old house what happens that night will surprise only those who haven t seen a movie or television show before after a string of murders in which the victims look like they re bleeding restaurant ketchup we have a painfully obvious twist ending the cast is lead by some once respectable actors must have been desperate for their paychecks there are also a few second tier actors who were rising at the time but long forgotten now as a result the film generates all the drama and mystery of an episode of matlock i will give credit where it s due the closing scene is clever and amusing if you re still awake
here s a movie with a good cast and nice looking location work but it just don t have it director richard brooks must have been a little bit tired at this stage of the game how much better his the professionals was the horses and the rest of the action seemed to be in slow motion even during the non slow motion scenes this film needed to be sped up if anything that horse lather sure looked awful phony to me and the obvious tire tracks in those desert tracking moments just lazy sloppy work too bad the actors did ok but i ve certainly seen all of them do better ben johnson s always a joy though i first saw this flick almost years ago was disappointed then and remained so upon second viewing years later
ok this movie was really unique shall we say carrie fisher was by far the most talented in the movie even though it is said she had a coke problem during the movie but she said that she can t remember to much of it well thats her excuse but whats everyone else s i can t imagine they all had a coke problem whatever it wasn t all that bad i mean i guess the plot was ok and it had some pretty funny moments although the part where the guy gets that thing shoved in his head was a little too violent for my taste oh well i guess i was disappointed cause carrie fisher is like so awesome and this movie did nothing for her
this movie starts slow then tapers off after watching for about an hour and seeing absolutely nothing happen i walked out i mean nothing happened zero zip nada there is no story the characters are vague representations of the most boring people any of us know the producers of this film could be sued in a court of law if they try to sell it as a motion picture there is no motion i could have told the same story with a couple still pictures with captions the script is a joke it s just awful i doubt that any script doctor in the world could save it my biggest regret is not that i wasted minutes of my life watching love in the time of money but that i missed a great opportunity to be a leader i could have been the first to walk out but i waited a bit too long instead i watched about people walk out before me
the acting other reviews notwithstanding was remarkably well done brad pitt handles the role of an annoying obnoxious austrian climber quite well other acting is fine the story could have been riveting but somehow it misses one never really understands or cares for the characters shown and so the story which could have been quite dramatic fails to draw in this audience beautiful scenery and cinematography a remarkably dramatic true story important events that shaped the world that we live in but i could not try as i might involve myself in this story as an unabashed brad pitt fan i consider him one of the top actors of his generation i expected to love this flick and yet it left me cold it could be a failing within myself but i tend to point toward the creative end of this movie direction scriptwriting production editing somehow they lost me it s a shame because it could have been wonderful good acting dramatic story beautifully shot it should have been magnificent it wasn t probably worth watching just to make your own mind up on it but don t expect too much and perhaps you won t be as disappointed as i was mostly it bored me
oh the hilarity oh the joy another film that is so bad it s good or so i thought in actual fact this one misses the so bad its good phase and goes sadly straight to the could have been so bad its good but they screwed it up and made it plain bad for a start its way too long cut half an hour and it might have been more endurable then put in such ludicrous plots as the man who is sabotaging the mission to save the earth because he has all the food stockpiled and he ll be rich if the mission fails duh or the talking bomb plot device last seen in dark star guess what just like in dark star the bomb has a malfunction hmmmm add in a dash of we can t act our way out of a kindergarten play and you have solar crisis in a nutshell light relief is to be had in the form of jack palance or jack pants as we called him in this flick whose sole purpose in the film is to drive a kid around the desert and telephone the kid s dad to come pick him up eventually between driving and phoning jack dispenses pointless drivel and leers and cackles a lot but contributes little to the story such as it is in short he s the best bit of the movie my award for the most ironic line delivered straight faced goes to charlton heston who when meeting his eldest son for the first time in ages comments that his son looks a little out of shape whilst he himself is standing there with his gut bulging over his waistband and in dire need of a captain kirk corset also amusing is the bad guy s top henchman who has a bright white hairstyle that kept making me think of andy warhol for some reason apart from these hilarities there s little to recommend this movie the ending is a sequence copied from but mercifully shorter than the end sequence from tips for enjoying this movie more if you are foolish enough to watch it like i did any time the bomb speaks imagine it s called tarquin trust me it works whenever chuck heston is on screen and about to speak pre empt him by reciting a line from planet of the apes such as get your filthy paws off me or similar whenever the female lead is looking stressed this is most of the time keep hoping against hope that she s having an aneurism and will die soon during the interminable the ship s broke again scenes keep hoping the tech engineer guys will spout a scotty ism like you cannae change the laws of physics or some such crap other than that do what it takes to get you through this one i dozed off half way through and woke to realise i hadn t missed anything nor had the plot laughable though it is advanced any so don t worry about tuning out for a few you won t miss anything
there are moments in this unique cartoon of pure beauty but overall it s not very good limited animation as well as sub standard character and background design will limit its mass market appeal the character design looks like a cross between the original star wars clone wars and disney s kim possible brendan the main character in this also bares an uncanny similarity to ron stoppable in kim possible background design ranges as far and wide as going from being bland and depressing to stylish and stark yet by today s standards overall it is still poor and cheap looking many of the backgrounds bare resemblances to eastern european or nordic animation from the mid s nice in its own way but for modern child audiences used to cg slug fests and talking dogs with every piece of fur on their body swaying in the wind is sure to disappoint the story is also not overly engaging and many of the voice actors aren t overly impressive noticeably the usually brilliant brendan gleeson who appears to be phoning in his part there are also a few secondary characters who come across as slightly clich and stereotypically racist however some of the characters are good the viking villains although underused are well done and are specifically foreboding in both look and sound there is one moment involving the main character and his mentor being saved by wolves from a viking attack that is very nicely put together the look and feel also seemed to be very inspired by the film watership down including a blatant rip off homage to the ghost rabbit of inlay the look is also clearly and obviously inspired by gaelic celtic anglo saxon art so if you are into these subjects you may be drawn towards its look the film also does have moments of very nicely structured shots leading the eye in a very artistic manner including a pretty match cut and a large scale viking attack that is very moody and impressive best of all though is the music much of the background music is melodic and moving specifically the song by the spirit girl which is truly beautiful and haunting and works very well with the images it covers if the whole film was as poetic as this moment and it tries then this would be a very beautiful and poetic film that would sadly still not reach a wide audience but instead it isn t a shame it wont reach a wider audience because most of it is average and cheap looking and doesn t stand up to modern animation standards overall a film that clearly split my opinion in many ways but all together not great but worth watching for the music and song and the occasional pretty or scary moment oh yeah and the cat seemed to live for a long time not sure how that was possible
olivier gruner stars as jacques a foreign exchange college student who takes on and single handedly wipes out a mexican street gang in this obnoxious and racist film which is so horrible that it s laughable bad acting bad plot and bad fight choreography make angel town a turkey
oh my god please for the love of all that is holy do not watch this movie it it minutes of my life i will never get back sure i could have stopped watching half way through but i thought it might get better it didn t anyone who actually enjoyed this movie is one seriously sick and twisted individual no wonder us australians new zealanders have a terrible reputation when it comes to making movies everything about this movie is horrible from the acting to the editing i don t even normally write reviews on here but in this case i ll make an exception i only wish someone had of warned me before i hired this catastrophe
the eternal jew der ewige jude does not have what we today would call the markings of a scholarly document rather than naming experts or sources to support what it says it simply says without opposition what it wants us to believe one will concede that american newsreels of that period were also much less regulated than would seem ethical to a modern audience often inserting dramatized scenes and passing them off as actual news footage add to this directed propaganda the fact that filmmaker hippler was preaching to the converted not so much asking gentile europeans to hate the jews as validating the feelings so many of them must have held already in order to have allowed the holocaust that followed the weakest link in the film s logic shows in its rat analogy wherein it goes on to explain the behavior of rats and then adds something to the effect of well jewish people are like that too similarly it characterizes jewish people as ugly by showing ugly jewish people in comparison to attractive gentiles the accompanying leap of faith is that ugly is bad the film appears to contradict itself a few times for example by attacking western painters who portrayed old testament characters as light skinned europeans thereby the text admits that so called hebrew ethnicity is in fact an ingrained aspect of christian culture it also shows ghetto jews willingly living in roach infested filth despite the supposed treasure they ve hoarded and then flip flops by saying that these same undesirables live in wealth and luxury as soon as they leave the ghetto incidentally who wouldn t the use of scenes from a well known american film house of rothschild shows an equally blurry deployment of logic first the film is denounced as having been made by jews then it is apparently used by hippler to verify the deceptiveness of jews the aforementioned pretense of poverty by ghetto jews shown as a means of avoiding taxation although the rothschild character s spin is that jews are taxed excessively finally the rothschild film is once again execrated for implying that the famed banking family invented the checking account this apparent indecisiveness in whether the american footage is shown positively or negatively might become clearer with repeated viewings but at first sight it makes for some murky moviewatching for all of eternal jew s imperfections i was at first surprised that the imdb viewer rating for this film is as high as it is just shy of a to date i d say the reason is that ej s documentary value has exceeded its original purpose offering us unintentionally a look into the lives of european jews as they would not be seen a few years hence needless to say the film s very badness also provides an historical insight into bad or simply evil filmmaking as a propagandist s tool about this time i should expect director hippler to flip flop once again springing forward to say that s what i meant to do all along the scenes depicting animal slaughter are particularly gruesome and show same as decidedly inhumane contrary to the intent of kosher law to prevent animal suffering i would like for someone who has seen the film and has some knowledge of these procedures to comment on whether the portrayal is accurate
first of all when i saw the teaser trailer for wendy wu i was definitely excited brenda song one of the hottest girls on disney channel would be doing martial arts and i was fine with that until i saw the movie the action was poorly constructed the movie couldn t have realated to anyone the fighting was unrealistic and it sucked along with the plot if you really think about it s a wannabe buffy the vampire slayer a girl who is the descendant of other warriors who were women a girl wants to ignore her calling and wants to become homecoming queen the watcher who bug s her to prepare for a big fight against some ancient evil the idea just wasn t all that original the movie is waste of time
i was one of the few non liberals who showed up to see steve s video it was quite an experience in propaganda film making and boredom i was hoping the film might be an actual documentary of michael moore s visit to my local school uvsc but it turned out to be another liberal slash and burn effort to slam conservatives and the local religious community it sure seems self serving for a filmmaker to make a documentary that only reflects his preconceptions on issues what s more surprising is to see all the votes his homeys have posted here did they even see the video golly gee batman this must rank with all the president s men their ratings are as obvious as the bias in this film yeah like stacking the votes at imdb will help a lame movie maybe my vote will help balance this out
i am ashamed to have this movie in my collection the most redeeming factor to owning the dvd is the short film in the bonus features my vote for this movie is a big fat zero don t misunderstand i m a horror girl but i want some meat behind the story not to mention i prefer the evil to happen to humans not to be tricked in to watching what seemed like forever clips of animal snuff acts of brutality interrupt achingly long silence and poor acting if i was forced to make a comparison to another film the only one that comes to mind is cannibal holocaust bad boring pointless and a wholly uncomfortable watch
in a far away galaxy is a planet called ceta it s native people worship cats but the dog people wage war upon these feline loving people and they have no choice but to go to earth and grind people up for food this is one of the stupidest f k ng ideas for a movie i ve seen leave it to ted mikels to make a movie more incompetent than the already low standard he set in previous films it s like he enjoying playing in a celluloid game of limbo how low can he go the only losers in the scenario are us the viewer mr mikels and his silly little handlebar mustache actually has people who still buy this crap my grade f dvd extras commentary by ted mikels the story behind the making of and a half minutes minutes seconds of behind the scenes footage ted mikels filmography and trailers for the worm eaters girl in gold boots the doll squad ten violent women featuring nudity blood orgy of the she devils the corpse grinders
you know you re in trouble when john cassavetes is operating at half speed instead of full throttle in a movie and the incubus is a dreadful worst case scenario of a great actor going through the motions to pay the bills actually observing the hammy script and john hough s baroque art direction one can hardly blame him the movie has something to do with a series of rape murders going on in a small town with a lot of supernatural hokum mixed in somehow the direction manages to suck tension and interest out of every scene and cassavetes seems visibly p o ed at times the incubus itself which doesn t show up until the last scene is a well done creation but it s not worth waiting for
from director barbet schroder reversal of fortune i think i saw a bit of this in my media studies class and i recognised the leading actress so i tried it despite the rating by the critics basically cool kid richard haywood half nelson s ryan gosling and justin pendleton bully s michael pitt team up to murder a random girl to challenge themselves and see if they can get away with it without the police finding them investigating the murder is homicide detective cassie the hyena mayweather sandra bullock with new partner sam kennedy ben chaplin who are pretty baffled by the evidence found on the scene e g non relating hairs the plan doesn t seem to be completely going well because cassie and sam do quite quickly have richard or justin as suspects it is just a question of if they can sway them away also starring agnes bruckner as lisa mills chris penn as ray feathers r d call as captain rod cody and tom verica as asst d a al swanson i can see now the same concept as sir alfred hitchcock s rope with the murdering for a challenge thing but this film does it in a very silly way and not even a reasonably good bullock can save it from being dull and predictable adequate
i wanted to love this movie how could i not love it cary grant jayne mansfield stanley donen all icons in their own way however the train wreck that was suzy parker ruined the entire experience for me her acting was so appalling that i sat there with my jaw hanging open not believing my eyes or ears i could barely make it through one viewing that s how hideous she is in this cary gorgeous and in fine dramatic form jayne adorable endearing and obviously having a ball the supporting cast does alright and the city of san francisco is captured in all its stunning retro elegance then you see suzy parker attempting to speak her lines with a woodenness a deadness a cluelessness that simply defies belief who told this creature she could act oy vey people
this absolute trash is based so closely on the friday the th series that is practically a carbon copy accept for it being an australian film with people who can t act once upon a time a young boy got burnt up accidentally during the filming of a music video at lake eildon now a number of years later the boy is all grown up and taking revenge on anybody who comes to the lake to film a music video it is cliche ridden and a waste of time and money see it only out of curiosity or if you re an aspiring actor trying to learn how not to not be able to act lead role alan dale used to star in the television soap opera neighbours but ended up in the x files how did that happen
checking the spoiler alert just in case perhaps one of the most horrendous movies i have ever seen mazes and monsters felt like i wasted minutes of my life the only redeeming quality of the movie were scenes that tried to be serious but just ended up being funny since they were so bad evil dead anyone unfortunately for m m fortunately for us it did not develop a cult following and result in a trilogy this movie tried to address a series of problems that the main character robbie played by hanks encountered throughout the film it ended up being a fear mongering video about stereotypes that helped fuel the d d is the devil movement in the s if you want to avoid wasting your time and money steer clear of this junk p s even though the cover looks kinda interesting which is why i guess my brother bought it it in no way takes place in a fantasy realm unless you consider new england or new york city to be such a place
i wouldn t say this totally sucked but if it wasn t for netflix i wouldn t even have this in my house steve martin s eccentric president of a chain of health food stores falls flat he s just not funny he s another in a long slew of snl rejects that can only find work whoring themselves to the next snl movie the birthing coach with the elmer fudd lisp is about as funny as it is original amy poehler simply goes through the same motions she would for a minute snl skit which is about as funny as snl lately the only thing going for this movie is that tina fey is easy on the eyes the ending was predictable as soon as you heard her character couldn t get pregnant the subject matter could have opened up to other comedic attempts but it seems to simple simmer along not really entertaining or creating laughs
been lurking for a couple of years or so i have never been moved to post on here before so perhaps this movie is worth a star for that but i doubt it i just watched it on dvd having missed it in the movies due to illness and never got around to watching it till now i had not read extensively about it certainly not even thought about the movie in some months it was just what the buddy picked up in the store so it got watched bad mistake the shot i spoke of in the the summary up top is in the trailer and on the poster right from the off jason statham has hair like in no other gr movie or any js movie that i ve seen at least not in the quantities on display here and ray liotta in underpants should be advance warned it s scary and funny but not in a ha ha humour way its more in an almost theoffice but slightly mutated and so failing sort of humour way they each say the same thing this movie is not like anything you expect this movie to be now based on previous extensive movie watching experience i expected this movie to be a few things like coherent interesting or engaging not a complete and utter farrago of navel gazing something more substantive than a motley bunch of badly realised fables from what is just a standard eastern mystic ideology dressed up as a cool modern self aware art form hopefully better than the idiots as you may have guessed by my tone it thoroughly failed to check any box above instead it was x badly edited pace all over the shop s amateur high style jump cuts incomprehensible plot twists delivered through hackneyed flash back montages i could go on x shot as if by a depressed yr old goth who d just spent the weekend watching truffaut and godard with the drapes drawn x so up its own behind with the whole i m really smart me motif message that it feels determined to repeat it every minutes or so just to make sure the dumb people ie everyone who doesn t like it in the audience make sure they get the point x a genuine waste of my time as for the undoubted ability of some people to get something from this fine i m glad you enjoyed it one poster said something that caught my attention under s probably understood it better because of the editing maybe but editing is supposed to make your work more accessible not less as for the genius is only recognised by the enlightened brigade out there go suck an onion and grow up there is nothing more presumptuous and self serving than people who say the reason another person doesn t know great art is because they don t understand the craft materials moon cycle filaments of supreme rational thought which the auteur poet artist palm reader idiot savant is using to explain his or her vision grand scheme oneness with gaea great big bucket of dog sick for me and many many more people its garbage movies art stories poetry anything designed to be viewed by another human is supposed to be engaging and moving in some direction be it metaphorical spiritual emotional or whatever you re having yourself the only way this moved me was forward in time two hours closer to my own inevitable demise the greatest trick he ever pulled was making you believe any part of this movie meant anything at all and now please by all means toast my buns for me
this movie is horrible it rivals ishtar in the number of embarrassingly bad moments i would have rated it lower than a save for a couple of funny lines but overall this film was crap it looked like they made it over a weekend at some bankrupt resort somewhere joe roth should join elaine may on the directing sidelines forever
with this cast and budget you will expect more john cusack has made a number movies that border on the strange yet still work neither he his sister nor sir ben could do anything to save this travesty of trite poorly written garbage the movie is nothing more than a series of sight gags and poor ones at that the plot goes nowhere the writing is contrived senseless and the characters paper thin if you think of a movie as being three dimensional where the story and characters bring a depth to the imagery this stinker comes across as flat as steamboat mickey dan akroyd s appearance in this brought back memories of another truly awful movie s nothing but trouble frankly this movie is the type of project that kills careers and gets agents fired
i m in awe wow prepare to be blown away by the uncanny ways of the ninja watch them as they pounce crawl along the ground on their backs or stomachs like a caterpillar fly through the sky climb buildings hide and spring from trees throw about ninja stars role out blue welcome mats disappear in smoke bombs make a lot of swoosh noises with their blades and quickly sneaking or trotting about on their toes what a sight really i could go on about the many traditional actions but i ll be here all day oh not to forget we even get the legendary chuck connors popping up now and again and watch him dispatch some ninjas with his shotgun with little ease what class what a badass anyhow the ultra cheap sakura killers is some stupid but cheesy ninja action fun that only fanatics of the genre would get anything out of this shonky b grade debacle a genetic lab in america has a very important video that s stolen by a couple of ninjas two americans are sent to japan by the colonel chuck connors to retrieve it the opening of the feature sets it up nicely get ready for the laughs afterwards it slows down but soon after the two main protagonists learns about the ninja and goes through the training it gets a head of steam as they break in costumes and fled after the stolen beta tape that contains a very important formula this is when the violently swift action and aerobic marital arts really come in to play it s not too shoddy either like the moronic script and daft performances the final climatic showdown is very well done in the slow stretches it has the two americans mike kelly and george nicholas looking in to the case sharing brainless conversations and encountering some minor problems what made me laugh was how the ninjas were put off by how brave and clever these two were these were supposed to be professional killers director dusty nelson effects does an earnest job with what he had and plays it for what it is he centres the on screen activities around striking taiwan locations the score is a chintzy arrangement
as a gamer i can t say i like this film fact is i down right hate it i tried to watch it as open minded as possible but when it gets down to it it feels rather insulting to my social group to me there are several reasons why the characters seem unnatural i ve met lots of players of all different walks of life i don t know any who act like any of the characters in the film it s like the producers of the film have taken the worst aspects of the worst stereotypes and put them all into people most gamers are rather social people some with rather active lives the style doesn t work the mockumentary style is ill suited to the subject matter of the film an actual documentary on gamers would actually work better while it is good looking i e cleanly put together it isn t very good the dialogue feels forced unnatural it also seems to lack any real world context gamers swear i ll admit that but we don t have tourette s syndrome the humor is lacking while self deprecating humor is a mainstay of my group and several other groups i ve encountered this is less self deprecation and more like toilet humor likewise a large part of gamer humor is full of in jokes and anecdotes not toilet humor most gamers would balk at and shun anybody who made such jokes the biggest problem to me is basically this accuracy i don t mean rules but instead dynamics invariably this film is going to be compared to the even lower budget films the gamers and the gamers dorkness rising both of which portray the players as actual people playing an actual game the difference is gamers the movie presents a situation where you want to beat the players senseless vs the gamers where you can say something like huh i know a guy like that yep that s definitely like gary
hood of the living dead and all of the other movies these guys directed look like they got together and filmed this with their buddies who have zero talent one afternoon when they were bored lines are completely unrehearsed and unconvincing i find that of amateur movies and of home video footage is better than this film although the similarities between them warrant the comparison hey lets see if anyone is dumb enough to buy our movies hopefully nobody else wasn t my apologies to those involved in the flic as this review is somewhat harsh but i was the dope who read your fake reviews and purchased the movie
it s been close to ten years since i ve seen either of the last two sequels to phantasm surely due to my still vivid remembrance of them not being very good that being acknowledged to this day i m still a huge fan of the first two installments so i thought i d go back and re experience the final chapters part three is definitely the worst of the series since it obviously takes itself less seriously and throws in a bunch of confusing stuff that doesn t make much sense again kicking off right where the previous movie left us reggie saves mike from the tall man who vows to come back for him later but things aren t safe for long when they come across jody who is inexplicably able to the take the form of a sphere apparently his soul is held prisoner by the tall man so mike is then dragged into the sinister double pronged netherworld and reg has to find him along the way he meets up with a ten year old kid and a nun chuck wielding black chick named rocky who assist him throughout his journey there s really nothing memorable about phantasm iii other than how stupid and forcefully humorous it tries to be only one positive aspect that didn t even help the movie and that was the return of a michael baldwin and bill thornbury who reprise their roles for the first time since the original classic the problem is they pretty much make cameo appearances reggie banister is of course back in his starring role but his bumbling love sick attitude makes his presence far too annoying to like angus scrimm also just didn t seem entirely into his role he talks too much here and is nowhere near as menacing and creepy in contrast with the quirkiness that the movie seemed to carelessly resort to most people s opinion on this flick seem pretty impassive and tend to think it s still entertaining maybe i m just too much of a nit picker but i just couldn t get into this one i remember disliking it when i was a kid and after re watching it i can safely say nothing has changed don coscarelli rocked the scene with his original low budget nightmarish legendary film phantasm which i still rank as my top favorite horror flick and his respectable sequel kept things moving and darkly surreal and gory but lord of the dead stupid title just looked too rushed and slapped together to me the inclusion of the two new characters tim and rocky the only thing missing was scrappy doo was a strong indication of coscarelli running out of ideas and seeing how far he could ride the franchise so it s a phantasm movie with very little gore nudity and quadruple barrel shot guns need i say more
i like billy crystal and i thought it would be fun to watch this film since i know he admired alan king and they would be funny together i thought i had seen all billy s movies but couldn t remember this one and now i know why it s so full of clich s and phony emotion you can smell each scene coming and going billy doesn t even get to be funny very often he s too busy trying to cry fake tears or show his angst at how badly his father let him down alan king himself is fairly likable as is the subplot about being an extra in the movies but what a coincidence that billy just happens to visit his father just as a major health crisis takes place etc etc or that two busy doctors can just shut down their practices to moon around in la and when the end comes boy does it come quickly almost as though the writers realized they had painted themselves into a corner and the only way out was to do a death scene mostly disappointing with a few glimmers of good humor
this film was done in really poor taste the script was really bad i feel really sad for the late gregory peck who took on the title role of this b movie adaptation of one of history s greatest generals the movie was politically incorrect and downright insensitive to the others who fought the japanese in world war there was a scene where i almost vomited it showed macarthur in a bunker in corregidor island talking to the troops like a seasoned politician when he comes across a wounded one legged filipino soldier the soldier bleeding and dying manages to sit up straight upon seeing the general and says no papa no mama no uncle sam and macarthur gives his little pep talk that americans would never abandon the philippines the scene ends with the soldier being invigorated by macarthur s words and gives him a smart salute i mean if there was a more condescending scene portraying the u s as the great white savior of the world please tell me because this one takes the cake it showed that filipinos are damsels in distress incapable of honor and have to rely on the great americans solely for redemption it blatantly and purposely overshadowed the contributions of the members of the usaffe united states armed forces of the far east these are filipino volunteers that were integrated in the us military during world war who died side by side with the americans fighting the japanese who walked side by side with americans in the death march of bataan and defended corregidor island by launching a guerilla offensive after macarthur left for australia with his famous i shall return speech my late grandfather a filipino world war veteran and usaffe soldier was one of the many who fought the japanese with honor and love for the home country i think this movie does not give honor to them and to the thousands of others that macarthur relied on for intelligence preparations for his famous return in the leyte gulf landing
i can t believe that people thought this stinking heap of trash was funny shifting the attempts at humor among cruelty disgust and stupidity there s something about mary leaves little reason to stay until the end sure cameron diaz is very pretty but that is never going to be enough to save a movie ben stiller tries hard to work within the plot and is obviously very talented but the movie is a loser not once were any of the scenes believable the shots were badly timed and poorly framed the farreley brothers should be kept away from making films at all costs i check imdb to see what they are working on just so i know what to avoid the bonus is from the one time i smiled it s not like i m immune to humor or alone in my opinion my wife hated it too the next day we saw rush hour and laughed ourselves silly this movie just stunk
i ve heard about this movie for many years and finally got a chance to see it a massive murdering of cheerleaders back in and eventually cause a cheerleading camp to close up fast forward to and bambi a former student opens it back up with new recruits among them candy carol kane glenn judge reinhold and sandy debralee scott one by one they are murdered by the killer until only one remains it is then when we find out who did it and why also in the movie are tom smothers doing a terrible accent as a canadian mountie and paul reubens doing his pee wee herman schtick the plot overall isn t very well developed and quite lame but some funny scenes do occur namely the house of bad pies and the strip poker scene the ending seems like it s thrown together which is a shame overall good for about ten or fifteen minutes total the rest you can just fast forward through maybe catch it on tv but it s not worth buying
i see what the director was trying to do but he missed the mark the main actor was really good but the editing around his moments takes you out of it the camera work ie lighting and exposer is kind of amateur which i could forgive if the direction was more fluent but it wasn t the sound was a bit off and that takes you out of the film as well i see could see this director doing a little bit better in the future so not a total right off but don t expect a dv movie nearly as good as days later or anything keep your expectations low and you ll get more out of it at least it was only an hour and a half oh yeah and other than the lead the acting was pretty bad if you ask me but i m a movie snob so take that for what that s worth
i saw not so fabulous rating on imdb but i went to see it anyway because i am a big fan of bible related material first thing that bothered me was a little too much indiana jones wannabe movie but it also looked like casper van dien didn t see those jones movies through but he should i believe he tried his best but script just stunk music tried to be kinda jones style too great work but for such movie it seemed like too much work like the video part did t deserve all that great music robert wagner gave his best acting skills he did a good job but somehow the script was bringing everything down jokes are old school somewhere years old they brought only cynic smile to my face there are some really bad camera angels sfx looks like homemade and unrealistic kevin vanhook had probably a good idea on the story in my opinion but i love such stories but things just didn t work out in the end maybe he should put it on a paper when it was still fresh in his head when i in first minutes saw that movie was going to be one of those low budget movies i hoped that i will at least hear a good story but sometimes movies just disappoint
since i had loved the inspector gadget cartoon in the s i went to see this movie i wasted my money the plot was very thin also the movie could not keep me interested for long i was glad it was over if you want to see inspector gadget watch the cartoon instead it was much better than the movie
this is hands down the worst movie of all time a combination of whoopie goldberg the worst actress person in history and a talking dinosaur ala jar jar binks add up to a painfully bad movie that was an understatement this movie is unwatchable for the love of god do not watch this movie
i watched this film along with every other adaptation i could get my hands on including seeing plays in preparation for some academic research the cinematography is very moving as is the music unfortunately all of the life was taken out of the story i have never seen such an awful portrayal of mr rochester all of his most fundamental traits are gone where is his wit where is his passion scott s rochester more closely resembles rochester s foil st john than the character from the novel in fact the actor playing st john in this adaptation played a passionate st john while scott is content to smash things or just stare at the ceiling which he does all the time i have no idea what they were thinking i would like to give this film a slightly higher vote based on the wonderful music and cinematography but i honestly can t bear to see this film for too long because of george c scott s performance
sleeping with the enemy is a predictable been there before thriller that never seems to find any inspiration no matter how desperately cast and crew try i can t believe a bunch of my friends talked me into seeing this at the movies some sixteen years ago the complete lack of originality from the ronald bass screenplay based upon the nancy price novel does not help nor does the stale direction of joseph ruben or the very average performance from julia roberts the supporting cast including patrick bergin and kevin anderson do little to help there really isn t a lot to say just give it a miss sunday april hoyts cinema centre melbourne
a famous show master enters the elevator with his girlfriend suddenly she kills him and runs away while an old lady gets a heart attack the name of the female assassin is sawa she is still going to school and works for an vicious criminal akai who is sleeping with her one day sawa finds out he killed her parents even the biggest anime fans will have to admit that this vicious action thriller is an disappointing gore fest kite has style but it is still trash the weird plot about a teenage girl that kills people as an assassin tried to be scary and touching at the same time only causing the story to fall flat on it s face one of the highlights is an action sequence in which the good bad heroine sawa is falling together with a bodyguard from a building yet the dramatic structure isn t nearly as good orchestrated and the director yasoumi umetsu s weird and grotesque animation of the character s faces is awful not only that the intercourse sequences are just simply creepy grade
what s written on the poster is at birth he was given years to live at he takes the journey of a lifetime ami is an american born israeli who was diagnosed with muscular dystrophy disease at the age of one at age of after the love toward his years old care giver didn t go well he decided to come to the us to face the doctor who said that he would have only years to live he wanted to show the doctor that he is still alive and weights pounds why your guess is as good as mine even i have seen this film obviously it s courageous to live when all he can move is his left index finger but why does he have so much anger toward the doctor who diagnosed his disease years ago his doctor just told his mom that based on the medical history people with his disease won t live long what s the point of him showing up at old doctor s door for why is tracking down this old doctor in the us is a journey of his lifetime there are so many things we might be interested in ami s life how can he make those animations with the movement of only one finger how can he go through daily lives while totally depending on others how did he out lived his doctor s prediction how does he deal emotionally when other people look at him like looking at a strange creature the movie told us none of that instead the filmmaker got a van and set up a trip to let ami to show up at his old doctor s door in order to show him that he is still alive i thought it was a joke
st watched out of dir ewald andre dupont fairly lame account of the titanic disaster is the first filmed version of this much heralded event the replication of the disaster is not bad but the drama around it is at some times silly badly acted and way too soap opera like the story is very much the same as the most recent oscar winning one except that we are shown how the crew tried to hide the actual disaster that was occurring until almost too late good for nostalgia purposes only and to get a feel for what james cameron was competing against barely in his recreation
my friends and i rented this for bad movie night with high hopes but the brain was something of a letdown the brain itself is gloriously goofy looking but it mostly just sits on its little platform who thought that it would be cool that the brain only gets to munch on three people throughout drawn out minutes this movie has a number of things going for it at first including an estevez knockoff lead playing a rebellious genius we re told that his enormous intellect is misdirected into his elaborate pranks and school stunts which include putting krazy glue on someone s chair it also has some great lines a hilariously out of shape and out of breath henchman who just barely manages to be everywhere and yeah some chick gets naked however the director desperately needs some schooling in the art of pacing during the last half things just start to drag on and on with at least or pointless boring chase scenes making up the middle third of the plot the scenes inside the pri complex are especially bad at least minutes of this movie are people running up and down the same stairwell i could ve fixed the screenplay to this thing in half an hour more cheese more gore more nudity more brain action if you re going to make a bad horror movie at least give me something cool to look at while my superego shuts down maybe the director was trying to really bring the audience into his movie i started feeling like one of the zombified townsfolk by the end of this crapfest
this film ends with a speech in which the narrator tells us the fates of two of the lead characters and that the names of people and places have been changed before telling us that relation to actual people and events are purely coincidental this ending line actually sums up everything that has gone before it as rino di silvestro s messy film completely lacks vision and if there is any point to the plot it wasn t put there on purpose werewolf woman is often seen as a guilty pleasure or a so bad it s good film but i completely disagree normally i enjoy films like this but werewolf woman is indeed a bad film and despite all the sex and savagery on display it doesn t even make for a fun watch and that really is unforgivable the film really doesn t have much plot but the thin sliver we are given involves a young woman who also happens to dream that she is a werewolf she dreams of going out and finding men having sex with them and eventually killing them back in the real world she falls in love but her lover is killed and she goes out for revenge the film is made up of scenes of sex and gore which are padded out with extremely dull talking sequences in which various characters mull over the recent events these scenes are probably there to forward the plot and build characters but they really don t do that and succeed only in turning what could have been a passable exploitation romp into an extremely underwhelming film it would seem that the director was more interested in style and atmosphere than the plot and this is shown by the fact that the film looks and sounds nice the sex scenes are often overlong and not very erotic but the gore works well the premise is ripe for giving way to a very sexy slice of exploitation as there s plenty of naked women and the fact that the central character has a werewolf origin means that there could be plenty of erotica but this isn t capitalised on and while i can stomach huge doses of bad acting and poorly done plot lines i really can t stand watching films and being bored overall i wouldn t even recommend this film to big exploitation fans there s plenty of better stuff than this out there and while the title may sound intriguing the film isn t
american movies about war and nazis simply cannot be good they can not refrain from becoming idiot and following an agenda all nazis are bad crazy too proud and americans are so modest yet so capable and sensible and human come on stop this bullshit the main character says something like by this trial we have to make aggressive war a crime is america a peaceful nation with its world billion defense budget china with just b is it simply spent in this without any roi why portray america as a peaceful nation when it isn t i deeply dislike movies with an agenda they throw art to hell and try to persuade us into believing something hollywood should put a label on movies just as record companies have that parental advisory label we should have a bullshit advisory propaganda advisory or a politically correct advisory label on some movies this is one of them
i recently decided to revisit the omen trilogy only to discover that insert demonic music here there is a fourth i didn t expect much from it and in that respect it certainly lived up to my expectations if you re into watching bad movies for a laugh then this just may be the movie for you oh where do we start from the onset the made for tv look and feel of the movie was obvious the music was often inappropriately matched with what was happening in the movie and therefore at best distracting the script had all the suspense of an year olds work of fiction but one thing that must be said is that the lacking script was very well matched up with the appalling acting numerous scenes left me contemplating whether it was the script or the acting that was the source of ridiculousness the story itself is quite thin centering on all the crazy antics of the daughter of damien thorn adopted out by wrong doing and badly acted nuns there is the usual lot of mysterious and convoluted deaths that personally made me yawn as the drama unfolded and the usual third party investigator into the whole affair later via some medical phenomena damien thorn jnr is born and that pretty much wraps up the plot the whole thing is executed rather badly right from the beginning with the lack of suspense making the movie one monotonous and or ridiculous scene after another there were many wtf moments too that provides the unintended comedy relief for example what s with the major over reaction at the beginning of the movie when the baby scratches the mother s cheek hardly a degree head turning omen i also laughed at the over reaction at the baptism the baby cries and everyone looks very concerned the distressed mother runs out of the church and the priest is left looking very alarmed while crossing himself huh then there is the new age nanny that seems to have carte blanche on exposing an year old to all kind of alternative spiritualism i laughed when the nanny suggested bringing the troubled delia to a psychic fair to meet the nanny s hippie friends and the mother just shrugs her shoulders and allows it yeah that s groovy fill my troubled year old daughter s head with all this mysticism stuff that s cool i don t need to be there of course this would be expected from a mother who allows her daughter to adopt a fully grown rottweiler they encounter on the street that could bite the little girls head off as a snack the entire scene at the psychic fair is quite comical in a slapstick kinda way from the horrified reactionary stares of the psychics to delia to the ensuing inferno i also laughed at how the nun s death is considered a freak accident here we have a religious zealot who is described as being part of a cult who is fanatically preaching in a pit full of rattlesnakes to prove how god s glory will protect them she antagonizes the snakes by handling them and somehow she is bitten several times hardly a freak accident more like a successful suicide attempt the snakes vs nun scene wasn t the only comical death there is the slow speed car accident resulting in decapitation in a school parking lot then there is the slow motion demolition ball headed straight for the detective i believe i may have gone and made a coffee when the slow motion started only to come back to see the demolition ball still headed straight for the concerned detective then there is the quintessential who shot who clich death where a gun goes off and both act as if they have been shot for several seconds while exchanging horrified glances then someone goes tumbling down the stairs revealing who the real victim was additionally the death of the priest at the beginning of the movie seemed a little strange and pointless to me he runs around looking at the architecture of the church obviously finding this quite distressing he eventually collapses clutching his chest and dies apparently something demonic was happening as this is what the music was suggesting ummm ok i am surprised that others have reviewed this film favorably and in particularly as a worthy sequel it is difficult not to notice the non sensical script the unrealistic acting and the inappropriate musical score the movie lacks any suspense relying heavily on delia s demonic stare to provide a sense of horror which becomes rather annoying after a short time bottom line this is a bad movie with the only redeeming feature being it s unintended potential for being a comedy
i m not sure if users ought to be allowed to review films after only sitting through half but i m afraid i just couldn t stand another minute if this abject excuse for a film doesn t have the late great gp spinning like a wheel in his grave then i doubt anything will the excellent review above not a film for parsons fans sums up most of my feelings how dare a second rate director and writer attempt something to which they re so clearly incapable of delivering what were they thinking where to start the script i thought i d be getting a slice of bittersweet americana what i got was poorly executed slapstick with no clich left unturned stupid hippy check stupid fat cop check awful plot contrivances check embarrassingly written female characters double check total disregard for the story which you re trying to portray check after a while you realize that what you re watching is a soap and not a very well written one at that scene with knoxville scene with ex girlfriend scene with knoxville which hasn t moved on much scene with ex girlfriend which was a bit like the last one and so on the direction my friends and i decided after some consideration that watching this was like watching a bad episode of quincy or maybe a particularly poor dukes of hazzard that s how bad the direction was terrible jump cuts awful camera work clunky ins and outs to scenes god it was cringeworthy and then i discovered the director was an irishman who s most noteworthy recent work is a really lousy bbc sunday night drama called monarch of the glen trust me it s lowest common denominator tv and then it all made sense the acting are we now so critical that when some random guy from the tv decides to give acting a go if he s not so bad he stinks we applaud his efforts knoxville just about manages to get through every scene poor christina a has no such luck her performance is a car crash though what you do with those lines i don t know the hippy in the hearse oh dear oh dear oh dear have we not moved on since cheech and chong i could go on but i think you get my drift what i would say is that as other reviews have mentioned no one on this film clearly gives a flying damn for the byrds the flying burrito brothers or gram s solo work they knew nothing about the american road movie and they certainly give a damn about trying to do anything with an admittedly decent story from rock mythology this film was shallow failed to explore anything and was jaw droppingly unfunny from beginning to oh wait i didn t quite make the end and i suggest you stay away too
the premise of the movie has been explained and if you ve gotten this far you don t me to pretend that i m a movie critic with that being said my own opinion of the movie is quite low i m a fan of takashi miike but this goes down in the category of his not so great work along with doa and and some others many the movie seems to get a free pass because it is a takashi film and nothing takashi does can be wrong this is a highschoolers approach to cinema for the rest of us we ll find and hour and a half of a kid screaming for no real reason completely annoying and yes this does take away from the film the pace of the film almost reaching levels of rigomortis and the acting well hmmm if one is a takashi fan you ll see it regardless to peak your interests it lacks any originality see the neverending story or any character development from the lead character in the face of conflict other then a quite superficial one as it has been pointed out this is the first film miike has been credited with co writing but that doesn t mean much as non of what we d hope would be miike s personality would spill over into the screen all we get are some of the token miike shots vis the director of photography the movie had the potential to be something great the premise is not a difficult one to run wild with but this one seemed to have been run into the ground my suggestion is if you re just getting into miike is go with some of the standards like gozu ichi and audition then movie into his works like blue s harp fudoh rainy dog bird people of china
this was a painful example of a cheap boring and unoriginal show produced by australian tv stations to fulfil local content quotas the writing was truly terrible and i m not surprised that the writers are those responsible for the worst australian film in recent memory the honerable wally norman nothing about this tv series was funny ever not even mildly amusing it was just tired and bad and worst of all it really thought it was funny it was simply embarrassing to watch there is something very suss about this show being given out of on imdb try to find a real review by a real australian viewer of the show there weren t many and it is impossible or crazy there are loafs of bread that are funnier than this show avoid the show at all cost and if it does come out on dvd remember that the laughter that deserves was unintentional
well they say nymphomania leaves you unsatisfied i don t know if stella james sean young qualifies as a clinical nymphomaniac but she certainly is in to sexual relations with men she s still exploring trying to find more data so she can see what she wants from life and the men in it though it seems like at her age she should have a pretty good idea by now i can t agree however with anyone who says young is too old for the role if she is we should all age so nicely for the most part this film left me cold though it s by no means the worst of its type you ll ever see and unlike the recent eyes wide shut at least something happens in this one
ok admittedly as an orthodox woman who lives in boro park i m going to be a little biased against this film however it seemed that boaz yakin s sole purpose in making this film was orthodox bashing with our wigs modest attire and separate seating we re a pretty easy target already yakin never made it past the surface the result is a film with more holes than swiss cheese yosi tells sonia off for loving him more than g d or their parents then he deliberately defies his father s order that he not go swimming because of his poor health sonia flips out at her son s bris why would a hasidic woman from monsey have such a strong reaction it s hard to believe that she never attended one before let s face it even reform jews hold bris milah ceremonies nowadays was mendel sleeping during his chosson classes he s supposed to satisfy his wife s passions in bed and refrain from kissing her in the street especially in the middle of the busiest street in boro park sonia and mendel had to have been married for over a year and he just now noticed that they were not meant for each other a little clue arranged marriage does not mean that the girl has to take the first guy her parents set her up with nor will she be shunned by the community if the marriage doesn t work out if sonia really wanted to get into the jewelry business that badly she did not have to go through her lecherous brother in law there are orthodox female doctors lawyers teachers etc sonia came off as more whiny than sympathetic instead of taking control of her life she sat back and waited for things to happen and then complained that she didn t like the outcome that s not standing up to one s environment that s pandering to stereotype frankly i think she got what she deserved
i guess i am coming late to the party i just saw this version of bye bye birdy on sky tv i didn t know it existed and was fully prepared to see the film version when i turned it on i played albert a long time ago and i am thinking of putting on an amateur production of the show because i remembered it as being so much fun to do i was not impressed with this newer version it just wasn t enough fun it was not colorful it lacked the exuberance of youth the lighting was bad no one seemed to mention this fact this is not a moody musical it is bright and up beat the lighting decision was a poor creative choice bye bye birdy is a farce a comedy of errors i got no sense of that in this version the lighting was awful and it dulled the overall performances the dance numbers seemed anemic as well we do have music videos these day at least the dance numbers should have measured up to some of the best of those or how about some of the best of broadway the choreographer was asleep at the wheel it seemed although all the actors were supremely talented there were some really bad casting choices vanessa williams is not latin and with so many talented latin performers out there wouldn t it have been more correct to cast one of them in the role of rosie vanessa is african american lovely and talented but bad casting jason alexander s effort was astounding he always does intelligent work but he just wasn t albert he was miscast and i think that is obvious to most people who see this version the medium of film is not the medium of stage there needs to be translation from one medium to another the exuberance and the flash of stage musical must be translated to film there is no merit being faithful to a stage script when it is being filmed the spirit the essence of the production must be brought forth to me the film production of bye bye birdy was bright and lively while the production was as gloomy as the lighting and as lackluster as the dance numbers it turned out to be an unfortunate waste of effort by many really talented people
maddy debbie rochon is a mentally unstable young woman with a troubled past who gets more than she bargained for when she goes to a pool party with a handsome coworker when her date and his friends jokingly say they belong to a murder club maddy takes it seriously and moves straight up to level by bashing in the brains of a woman in a parking garage for denting her car but is maddy also the one donning a plastic mask and killing off other members of the group or has someone else lost it the plot of this film originally titled make em bleed is very poorly conceived full of holes and spirals completely out of control before a ludicrous out of left field twist ending some of the dialogue is downright laughable i didn t have a problem with rochon s performance but the supporting cast was atrocious however i managed to sit through this full moon release thoroughly entertained there s plenty of skin and blood and it s the perfect type of flick to sit around with a group of your buddies and pick apart horror fans may also enjoy the cameos from brinke stevens and lloyd kaufman as debbie s parents and julie strain an early victim score out of
with a title like attack of the killer tomatoes anyone going into this thing would be expecting either a a bad science fiction movie or b a comedy making fun of bad science fiction movies it s supposed to be a mix of both with a dose of parody splashed in unfortunately it falls flat very soon you re never supposed to take this movie seriously i realize that but you re supposed to think it s funny right i found only a few of the jokes or situations were funny i e the side by side phone conversations the russian olympic spy eating steroid cereal superman walking by lois etc attack of the killer tomatoes strives to be a cult classic but it doesn t make it a cult classic is a movie that is so different that only a select group of people understand it or a similar description attack of the killer tomatoes could be enjoyed by any year old with a bad sense of humor so therefore it does not qualify as a cult film there is one good actress in the entire thing sharon taylor as lois fairchild she is a thin gawky reporter but has an endearing personality loves to overact and is a natural comedienne unfortunately she is put to bad use here attack of the killer tomatoes is not as funny as say amazon women on the moon or kentucky fried movie but it does have a few hilarious moments so i would still recommend seeing it once avoid the director s cut it has interruptions by the producer of the movie and some supposedly lost footage dubbed in a pretend african dialect it can be found in english on the out of print tape
i had suspicions the movie was going to be bad i m a duke s fan from way back have three years of the tv series on dvd well i was right took the family to see it i really wanted to see the general jump again and some of the chase jump scenes were good but to sum it up the movie was a dumbed down tarted up version of the tv show jessica simpson was pathetic while i can honestly say that the original daisy s outfits were just as revealing jessica simpson s interpretation of daisy was simply awful sorrel booke and denver pyle must be rolling in their graves as well don t waste your money if you are an old tried and true dukes fan like me and my three kids are you will be very disappointed
this really is the most dreadful film i have ever seen i simply have no idea how anyone has the audacity to put this on release the production standards are atrocious there is no pretence here at cinematography the camera work scripting acting and sound are unbelievably crass i think there is a plot but it could have been done in minutes sparing us the time to watch it the hysterical neurotic girls at the centre of this piece have no credibility whatsoever i would urge anyone to avoid spending any time or money on this title it is truly atrocious jdd december
it s always tough having a sibling doing better in their life than you always a struggle to get out from under that shadow and not let bitterness keep you away from your family so imagine that your older brother is santa and then imagine how tough that must be that s the premise here vince vaughn plays the titular fred an embittered loser who spends a lot of his energy making sure that people don t go around expecting good things to happen to them or giving his brother santa played by paul giamatti too much praise for simply being the limelight hogging fame hungry slightly creepy guy that fred would want to portray him as then wouldn t you know it fred needs a financial favour and so has to make up for it by helping his brother on the run up to christmas and hilarity and life lessons ensue well that s what should happen the reality is that we get a christmas movie featuring a few good moments of vaughn s patented fast talking a ridiculously out of nowhere music video moment kevin spacey playing an auditor out to close down santa s operation and he s one of the weakest baddies i have seen in some time not enough of the gorgeous elizabeth banks in a lush christmas outfit too much of john michael higgins in his elf outfit to be fair he s a highlight though and a movie that s too swimming in bitterness to feel like good seasonal fare yet too schmaltzy in it s latter half to feel like a fun poke at all the bad things about the commercialism of the time rachel weisz is along for the ride too as is kathy bates but it s really nothing more than a movie for vaughn and if you like his style you will find something to enjoy here unfortunately there s very little else to recommend this seasonal stinker outside of vaughn s rantings the script barely throws up anything decent with the exception of one particularly good scene involving a hilarious support group dealing with a very specific problem david dobkin s direction is as mediocre and staid as the p christmas card that you send the auntie you haven t seen in years and he seems to think that simply putting the ingredients together without a good mix or decent care taken will guarantee a delicious christmas pudding nope we get a burnt bland lump with too much sugar on top forget this and stick the hilarious elf on again if you want a great modern christmas comedy see this if you like the santa clause santa baby the santa clause the escape clause
i read a couple of good reviews on this board for mr scarface but for anyone uninitiated in the genre of italian gangster films like myself the picture will probably make very little sense indeed after the initial setup involving the ten million lira scam the picture devolved into a fairly routine revenge flick with a minor twist in the identity of rick s al cliver character the whole gang war plot got muddied up for me with the inclusion of vinchenzo napoli vittorio caprioli but as most other viewers commented he s about the only one who gave this picture any life with his often ineffective attempts at violence i found it somewhat unbelievable that manzari s goons who chased tony through the streets didn t actually stroke out before tony even laid a hand on them for all of his buildup as the title character jack palance was wasted rather unceremoniously in an anticlimactic near finale making the u s working title mr scarface rather moot i ve seen enough spaghetti westerns to know that they don t all work i guess in this case my first look at a spaghetti gangster flick didn t quite make it either
this ambitious film suffers most from writer director paul thomas anderson s delusions of grandeur highly derivative of much better material altman s nashville lumet s network this lumbering elephant takes far too long to get nowhere a couple of misguided detours along the way an embarrassing musical interlude a biblical plague don t help matters neither does the uneven level of performances especially bad william h macy whose character and storyline could easily have been eliminated altogether julianne moore for her unconvincing angst and how many times must we see john c reilly s sad sack shtick chicago and the hours will suffice tom cruise comes off well by comparison his misogynist foul mouthed holy roller was rather amusing speaking of foul mouths the script was so loaded with f bombs they lost their impact in no time don t even talk about that awful soundtrack full of insipid and annoying vocals by aimee mann her extended rendition of one a maudlin number to begin with drove me to distraction at the start of the film i should have heeded the handwriting on the wall and saved myself three more hours by which time i d been pushed to the brink of hell one redeeming feature which i haven t seen mentioned in other reviews is the best performance in the bunch by unknown melora walters in the role of claudia the damaged coke fiend bent on self destruction her credibility exceeded all others by far this film took itself way too seriously and just didn t know when to end
even if you subscribe to the knee jerk anti free trade politics of this movie it is still just the same tired note played again and again and again clink clink clink even if you can accept a preacher with peroxide hair who advocates a return to first principles the reverend billy is pretty hard to look at as a serious figure the clownish reverend is the sort who wakes every morning with no aspiration more ethereal than to see his own face on tv before he climbs back into bed that night he has a pretty wife i have to admit but it would take tons more than that to save this dreary mess of a movie the interminable bus rides are the worst part with progress shown can you guess by a colored line moving across a map aww you guessed oh well it has the virtue of being short is that the only favorable thing i can say hmmmm yep afraid so
even if you could get past the idea that these boring characters personally witnessed every significant moment of the s ok so katie didn t join the manson family and nobody died at altamont this movie was still unbelievably awful i got the impression that the writers just locked themselves in a room and watched forrest gump the wonder years and oliver stone s s films over and over again and called it research a canadian television critic called the conclusion of the first episode head spinning he was right
the interplay between the characters is a moral disaster you end up disliking most of the characters and you don t particularly like any of them even the two main characters played by david and gwen are so badly written that you really don t care one bit about them the movie has no plot no direction and no purpose the single redeeming quality of the movie was to treat it as a glimpse into the messed up lives of a few losers and that s hardly stimulating even as an afternoon waste
terminus paradis was exceptional but niki ardelean comes too late we already have enough of this and we want something new big directors should have no problems seeing beyond their time not behind why people see romania only as a postrevolutionary country we are just born not reincarnated and nobody gives a s t anymore about old times most people dont remember or dont want to remember and the new generation of movie consumers dont understand a bit this should be the first day of romanian movie not the final song priveghi maybe younger directors should make the move
the title song for this movie is the greatest free spirited ballad ever written i first saw this movie back in when i first subscribed to cable in cable was just starting to become common place in homes or at least that when it was becoming common here in missouri this might very well be the first movie i ever watched on the pay channel called the movie channel which was called the star channel back then they changed the name to the movie channel in the early s i received a free month of the star channel with my new cable subscription the van was one of the movies that was in heavy rotation on that network at that time i remember watching this movie back then and thinking it was a typical teen flick along the same lines as other medium budget teen flicks the ones where the plot revolves around nudity and parties i totally forgot that this movie even existed until i recently seen this movie again after having not seeing it for decades i found a copy of it on dvd for sale in cheap bin i recognized it and bought it for a mere seems like i had remembered this film being much better that it was is however watching it back then was a different experience than watching now years later it was fun to see the kids listing to rock n roll music smoking weed and having sex in the back a fancy van often all at the same time this is what a good teen party movie should be there isn t much of a plot other than the fact that the main character fantasizes about having sex with his arch rivals good looking girlfriend he blows all of his college savings money to purchase a tricked out dodge van with shag carpet walls mirrored ceiling and a water bed in it to get her attention and he eventually gets to have sex with her but his arch rival finds out and comes looking for him so that the two of them can settle their differences by drag racing their vans he and his arch rival end up wrecking both of their vans and instead of stealing away his arch rivals girlfriend he wins over the heart of a preppy lesser attractive girl that he half ass dates through most of the movie and he decides he is happier better off and the movie ends the movie does have it s funny moments but watching this movie years later it becomes more of a trip down memory lane because i still can remember pizza parlors pinball arcades it also brought back memories of cruising around a small town while we smoked pot as we would yell at good looking girls and hoping to get laid sometimes i d get lucky and get some decent looking girl to share a joint with me and we d screw in the backseat afterwords i also remember many of the songs in this move when they were new this movie serves as a perfect time capsule for that era in those regards brought back lots of memories the one thing that is depicted in this movie that i honestly can not remember is i never remember a time when full sized vans were as popular as this film depicts them as being i remember that era very well and i don t young men going around wishing they had a van instead i remember young men in the s self included wanting a pontiac trans am chevy camaro or a hot rod ford mustang but never a van this movie makes it appear as if vans were most popular item going and that every young man wanted one which just wasn t true of that era
seriously i mean very seriously when i first started watching the show i thought it was good but the plots just got worse the storyline were either too boring or predictable george isn t always funny he sometimes acts stupid his jokes are overdone his mom is the silliest character of the show how can a mother treat her own son that way okay if it was the daughter in law but this was her own son i give this show a just because the first few shows were a little funny the actors constance marie and masiela lusha do a great job don t know how these shows get to play for so long if you re really bored like i was and have nothing else to watch i d suggest you watch this
this movie sucks from beginning till especially the end you probably don t get m any worse acting storyline photography camera work etcetera it s all bad very very bad but that s what makes it a great watch it will give you more than enough good laughs the worse the better i really have no clue what so ever of what these people were thinking making this movie a serious viking movie the story is goddamn ridiculous it s more like a comedy in disguise kinda like mafia also pointless but damn funny and look out for the very very end of the movie uhum
the movie and acting are not bad and jay hernandez does a good job playing calito brigante but the movie forgets it s suppose to be a prequel to a hit movie the makers of this prequel clearly did not watch the original carlito s way or at least did not care about continuity this movie is a prequel which means the original movie has already laid out some history for us and this movie should end where the original begins or at least lead up to it not one of carlito s close old friends from the original make an appearance in this movie they re not even mentioned luis guzman pachanga in the original is in the movie but he plays a completely different character the original takes place in and the prequel takes place in considering this movie takes place less than years earlier wouldn t you think one of carlito s long time friends would make an appearance in the original carlito start s out being released from jail after spending years in jail that s only a few month s between the end of the prequel and the start of the original semi spoiler we know from the beginning of the original carlito has spent years in prison so when the prequel gives us this hollywood happy ending it s an insult to the intelligence of fans of the original what happen to gail it s the lack of continuity that made this film go direct to video release
understand i m reviewing the film i have seen i realize virtually all the nudity and gore was cut from this film thus neutering it completely when seeing names like ginger lynn and jenna jameson attached i knew i wasn t going to get a horror classic but at the very least i expected gratuitous boobies and bloodshed but no this has got to be the most butchered modern horror film i mean it s easy to tell there is much more to certain scenes but they suddenly cut away or the scene just totally ends right as it begins how does one screw up cannibals and porn stars i mean thats a winning formula it makes me wonder if the director slept with some executive s wife or something because it is literally amazing how much got cut from this reading about it a few years back in fangoria i was excited it looked like a fun film but unfortunately the true film is locked in a vault somewhere and we must endure this piece of excrement retitled evil breed hopefully an unrated cut will be released someday as i think a good movie exists in this mess but until then best grab a twelve pack of bud cause thats the only way you ll make it through this movie
all i can really say is that i m glad that i was knitting socks while watching the movie or i would be very angry for having wasted hours of my life the acting was terrible the plot was even worse there were some scenes that were meant to be serious that had my husband and i laughing out loud i highly recommend this movie to people who like to do their own version of mst k
i thought this movie had absolutely no moral i mean how would you feel if your fianc left you on your wedding day for your cousin i would be heartbroken it s classified as a comedy but i didn t find it funny at all i thought it just mostly found cheap laughs and took them i normally love julie stiles movies but this is an exception jason lee stars in another disgraceful show which once again proves that class and decent morals are not relevant in todays society it had a complete lack of taste and i despise movies like this i understand that people will defend this movie and it s morals because it is just a movie but i still stand by my mark that this bad behaviour shouldn t be allowed on screen i m not trying to say that if you enjoyed this movie you are a bad person as everyone is entitled to their own opinion and parts of this movie were enjoyable i m just saying that in real life people acting like the characters in this film were doing is shameful
i wanted to watch this movie because of eliza dushku but she only has a smaller part in it and her character isn t very likable however the main character played by melissa sagemiller is extremely beautiful and a perfect delight to look at throughout the movie this is really nothing but a showcase for her looks and talent she does a very good job the story itself is on the face of it pretty nonsensical after a car crash some friends are possibly dead but keeps on living their previous lives while all sorts of mysterious things happen some bad guys are after them but we never really find out who they are possibly they were the ones in the other car but we certainly don t hear anything about why they are after them the final scenes especially seem filmically ambitious but i can t get anything coherent out of it the opening scene where the bad guys who wear some strange masks cut a blond girl s wrist and gather up some of her blood is never explained or followed up on unless the bad guys are supposed to be a representation of the surgeons who re trying to pull cassie sagemiller back from the dead but no that doesn t seem to work the bad guys are just bad guys they really just mess up a story that might otherwise have been interesting in a supernatural story about death and love and sacrifice who the hell needs bad guys out of
the film gives a rather condensed version of what is contained in the book which as far as i can tell by doing some research and investigative fact checking is largely a work of fiction in reality there are no ancient scrolls and if the author was hard pressed i m sure he d have to admit he s never laid eyes on any scrolls in ancient aramaic found in peru these valuable texts written as usual by anonymous were destroyed by the evil truth haters in the church and in the local government that s rather strange as all kinds of new age crap comes out each year hundreds of books dozens of movies and the roman catholic church doesn t seem to me to be hell bent on destroying the movement which it probably views as i do a total crock of doody i m no fan of the church mind you but at least the ancient texts which they base their faith on are real it s a typical pattern of scam artists and religious hucksters to claim to have seen or translated ancient documents which unfortunately got destroyed by evil men or in joseph smith s case got taken back to heaven once translated therefore the actual texts cannot be found in any museums like the smithsonian nor the translations checked by specialists in ancient languages like coptic or aramaic it s a scam in one sense i admire anybody smart enough to come up with a great idea and make millions off it but i couldn t do it myself as i ve no desire to mislead the public with more new agey hokum occasionally a genuine ancient text does get found hidden away and lost for years the gospel of judas a gnostic text was discovered and after carbon dating and diligent study of the text deemed authentic by experts the gospel of judas was referenced as heretical around c e no church documents from that time mention any celestine prophecies as authentic heretical or anything else we are evolving towards something that much is true but the optimism in the celestine prophecy is based on nothing but fiction and lies and a philosophy built on a foundation of lies like a castle built on sand will collapse the harsh ugly overpopulated cruel world of blade runner is more likely what it ll be like over the horizon than some utopian hippie commune where all is love and peace i tell people the truth and they hate me but tell them what they want to hear even if pure piffle and one can make millions the celestine prophecy is what the world wants to hear too bad it is a castle built on sand don t get me wrong i wish to god the celestine vision was reality only it s not no ancient philosophy at any time expressed ideas given in the insights with the modern concept of spiritual evolution going hand in hand with biological evolution these new agey ideas did not exist in the ancient world and did not exist until darwininan evolution became well known that means the ideas in the celestine prophecies cannot be older than the s c e and do not go back to the early b c e period or near the time of jesus of nazareth this type of claim by new agers is not at all unusual wiccans claim their brand of magic and witchcraft the old religion goes back to the stone age when in reality no book of shadows has ever been known to exist prior to gerald gardner who lived in the s and was the buddy of aleister crowley new age gurus tell lies and claim their ideas are based on ancient teachings when the ancients would thumb their noses at such absurdities that are preached by gurus today why do they do what they do perpetrate such fraud simple there are millions of dollars to be made and the modern guru acquires power over his or her followers they compete fiercely and have a strong hatred for their competition despite their claims of love for all things each new age group bitter opposes the others it s a struggle for your minds and your wallets but learn one thing from me that is actually similar to one of the insights learn to follow your own instincts and look for guidance from within that i can agree with wholeheartedly
i have walked out of very few movies before they end but i couldn t finish this piece of garbage this was the biggest load of racism trying to pass as legitimate film since birth of a nation the characters were little more than cardboard cutouts i don t see how any actor would want their name associated with this film lee must have better things to do that put out garbage like this i know that i and anyone with a brain have better things to do like watching paint dry i wish that someone would make a film about interracial relationships that dealt with the topic realistically there is a lot more depth to this subject the shallow ranting of a bitter director like lee
it s terrible how some people can get away with such things this is one of those overrated things again and i hate things that are overrated that are no good why can t we have more tv shows and movies that actually have a story and excellent music and that are well written and are actually about something it takes many people to make this movie the series and the band all possible and those people are all wasting their time it seems that the bands are getting younger and younger i looked at how small that they were and i thought that they were or it s sad that kids are performing that young they are still too young performing takes a lot of work and they have many other things that they need to do with their lives the idea about having a very young band is horrible they need to stop having bands like this and i don t like the idea at all nor the kids themselves they are very annoying very young and their name is the naked brothers band the people that are involved in this and the people that are supporting this have all lost their minds whenever this band is shown on tv change the channel and petition to get it banned and i know that this is a very boring comment thing but you get the point this band sucks get rid of it
i am a big fan of low budget horror movies like this but come on this has to be the worst piece of monkey s t i have ever seen i ignored the reviews posted on this site figuring that it would fall into my taste in horror but i got bored and turned it off let s see the wardrobe consisted of cheap cameo outfits and painters outfits from home depot the masks were made from what looks like tin foil the gore the gore was pretty good i must give it that but ittenbach s burning moon was better for a low budget movie acting was horrible i didn t mind the dubbing i find this humorous like in ittenbach s premutos great movie the fighting and action sequences were pi poor bottom line don t watch any of schnaas s movies there are much better directors like jorg buttergeit and olaf ittenbach with movies of the same gore and subject matter check premutos house of blood schramm and the nekromantiks
invasion of the star creatures would definitely be in the so bad it s good category if the film wasn t quite so sexist or racist that it is such just makes it plain bad it has the same kind of hardline stereotypical sexism that you saw in queen of outer space and the kind of racist stereotypes in this instance native americans that you would normally find in thirties forties b westerns in terms of being non funny the same walking through the cave gag is repeated well over ten times during the course of this fairly short movie ray does do one good impression of jimmy cagney but can t make it work for two impressions of cagney in a row nor handle a peter lorre when he tries it there really aren t any production values to speak of as the star creatures make the ro man from robot monster or tor johnson in plan from outer space look like creations of industrial light and magic this film was definitely one of a vanguard of what you would have to call early independent cinema not artsy enough for those theaters and not good enough for anything but the last feature of an all night drive in
before i start let me say that i fully believe in god i believe in heaven and in hell kay now that thats out of the way i just wanna say that what in the world do these morons that call themselves hosts think they are doing the last time i checked a host doesn t discriminate spew hatred filled rants on tv or try to shove their own beliefs down every unfortunate soul that ventures onto the channel all of these that crazy idiotic conservitive bible thumping fred phelps lover pat robertson does daily i am all for free speech but since when does that cover a guy who pretty much says that if you venture off his ideal way of life you are right away sent to hell this is just a perfect example of why religion is the cause of soooo many problems one day in my class room we had a substitute teacher in so we decided to watch some tv since the teach didn t give us any work and we against many of us s will watched s club and of course that jerk pat was on ranting and raving about the bible and he said simon along the lines of god says homosexuality is a sin and i actually heard a kid go hmm i guess he s right wtf seriously if the host is trying to make people think that someone else s sexual orientation is a huge sin then they seriously need to take that host duct tape them and throw them off of a cruise liner in the middle of the arctic
marvin rob schneider does not have the ingredients to be a cop which is his lifelong dream but his luck changes when he has a car crush a very bad one and is found by a doctor the doctor has to use animal organs to rebuild him after this moment he starts to have wild behaviours unconsciously and becomes a best cop one could ever be by the time he realises the changes and his animal instincts starts to take over his human side in the mean time he finds a lovely girl and try to be a perfect gentleman that means he has to control himself and behave civilised i am not a big fun of rob schneider in fact this is the his first film i have seen however i can easily say that he is the best person to play the loser see his part in ally mcbeal quite funny actually there are some good parts in the movie such as his flirting with the goat in such movies the biggest problem is that the script is seems to make the viewer feel less intelligent i am sure this movie is okay to watch as long as it is not taken too seriously but very sad to see such films doing very good in the box office the animal is not the worst film i have seen to date but fails to get more than
if you have ever seen a movie by brian avenet bradley and compares it to the feedbacks it gets on imdb you know that most of the comments and votes are faked trust me you will be bored people of the production team write their feedback themselves sometimes they even admit it but that s not enough they also click constantly no whenever there is a negative comment on the movie that s why negative critics are always placed behind the hyped ones the movie itself is bad bad bad bad acting bad lighting bad script bad ending believe me now if not you will believe me later brian avenet bradley might be quite a good business man otherwise it cannot be explained that he finds people who still finance his movies okay they are cheap but nevertheless but as a creative person he is a complete failure
the name cult movie is often given to films which continue to be screened or to sell in home movie format more than a generation after they were first released superchick which was first released in now comes into this category its cult status is largely due to ongoing interest in it by those women who regard it as an early and effective feminist film despite the superwoman connotation superchick is not a cartoon character but a very competent young lady working as an air stewardess a career option which in the s was commonly regarded as one of the most glamorous open to any girl and which also enables her to emulate the traditional matelot who reputedly has a wife in every port since she holds black belt status in karate she is in a position to make it quite clear that she is very happy with her bachelor existence and is in no way beholden to any of her extensive suite of male admirers this film is a situation comedy which avoids the generally much shorter lived appeal of outright farce its appeal to feminists is also heightened by a climax in which our heroine uses her karate abilities to avert a hijacking and save all the other passengers on her plane from a potentially unpleasant fate to ensure that this film will appeal to men as well as to their partners the director has wisely ensured that is liberally sprinkled with eye candy superchick can be enjoyed by those who are not too critical and want a very light easy to watch comedy which they will forget soon after viewing it is so forgettable that they will probably find it equally enjoyable if watched again in a year s time despite its age it may therefore retain its status as a cult movie for some time to come however the dialogue and acting would make it hard to give this film a rating of more than
alright i got passed the horrible acting i got passed the fact that lil kim was blasting some cannons and her arms or hands weren t moving i got passed the weaves i got passed the colored contacts this is what killed it for me in the scene where the four roses were sitting at the table arguing lisa raye and monica calhoun stand up and and then lil kim gets up to break up any hostilities by saying whoa whoa whoa hold up let s chill out here for a hot second i am a fan of the western movie genre and i never heard anyone talk slang like this in any of clint eastwood s movies if anyone thinks this movie deserves over a rating please tell me another movie that s worse than gang of roses i m through
this really doesn t do the blues justice it starts out badly with images from the voyager probe and blind willie mctell or was it blind lemon jefferson someone blind anyway apparently narrating from outer space and telling us the life stories of various blues musicians corny as it is this might be the visually most interesting part of this documentary afterwards the only thing to see is actors incompetently mouthing the classic tunes filmed in fake s black and white intercut with the likes of beck and shemekia copeland raping the same songs afterwards this is a good device to show us why the old blues greats were really so great but it doesn t make for compelling viewing there is hardly anything in here that could justify making it a film and not a radio play nobody should be forced to see these badly done reenactments it s a shame for wenders scorsese and especially for the blues avoid at all costs
the first five minutes of this movie showed potential after that it went straight from something possibly decent to some sort of illegitimate comedy the best part is that i couldn t stop thinking of supertroopers thanks to joey kern i would recommend watching this movie for the sheer fact of learning how not to make a movie there are so many scenes in this movie that makes one just stop and wonder if the entire cast and crew just stopped caring at some point the thing that amazes me most about this movie is that it grossed million in the box office and only cost about million to make congrats to lion s gate for being able to pull that one off
the film must have been shot in a day there are scenes where you can see the camera reflections and its red pointer even the scenery s green light that blends with the actors the plot and the lines are really awful without even the slightest inspiration at least as a thriller genre movie everything that got to do with poe in the movie has a shallow and childish approach the film is full of clise and no thrilling if you want to watch a funny b movie for a relaxing evening with friends then go for it you will enjoy it as i did but there s no way to take this film seriously
ok the portrayal of the stereotyped indians in this story is just plain wrong i do agree that elvis looks rather good here but yeah his skin color does seem to change during the movie i was thinking ok he was never that tan in real life it s some of the most obvious brown indian makeup that i have ever seen it s as bad as the indians on f troop and the old hollywood westerns who were played by jewish and italian american actors and not real native americans this movie is o k but typically lame story and mediocre songs like in all of elvis later films he just did them because colonel parker had him tied down to long term movie contacts to squeeze as much money out of elvis as possible i keep thinking thank god that elvis stopped making movies forever not long after this movie came out it is cool to see character actors joan blondell katy jurado l q jones henry jones and burgess meredith in this movie though burgess meredith s indian makeup is absolutely awful it s the worst of the bunch for sure what were the filmmakers thinking was mr meredith doing this one just for the money or what i do love certain elvis movies though for example love me tender jailhouse rock viva las vegas i can even stand to watch his movie with future tv co stars mary tyler moore and ed asner change of habit in which elvis plays an inner city doctor oh well at least elvis made a few good films but the mediocre and bad ones overwhelm the decent and good ones i ll always love elvis thank you thank you very much
i watched the dvd called black widow in the u s a and felt afterward that it was indeed a truly awful movie but they must have cut quite a bit out of the original film or i missed a lot the sex scenes had very little vulgarity and no nudity not even a breast but i ve read several other comments on imdb com mentioning the vulgarity and something about a tampon i did not see anything like that just a bad boring film with unlikable characters and a trite sophomoric plot giada colagrande is either paralyzed from the mouth up or botoxed to the gills and nary an expression touches her face and her name makes me think of super sizing a beverage at taco bell i ll have the cola grande it was actually kind of fun it was so bad i got to play like i was in my own mystery science theater noting things like the fact that dafoe s skin is too big for his face it s really like silly putty
ed wood is eclipsed and becomes orson welles this film is fantastic vampire witches who fight in terribly choreographed scenes and dialog that could have breaking ribs with laughter plan from outerspace dons t stand a chance against this described by the writer and psychic stephen armourae on the vampire forum as a masterpiece he s from england and thoroughly sarcastic it has stephanie beaton and the producers know whats going to save them from bankcrupcy by repeatedly using her though she leaves me cold as she looks more like the undead than all the devil raisers and eileen daly is just a lower rate elvira the whole thing is badly done watch it for the script though
ok well i found this movie in my dads old pile of movies and it looked pretty good from the cover but the movie actually sucked ok the first story with the swimmer was pretty good but it took a while to get into then the one with the boy was completely retarded it wasn t even scary his dream sounds like a little kid s bedtime story then the news girls one was completely retarded too i m sure someones going to call up the news guy and ask him to go out with you but that one ended cool where she stabbed him and she was in the hospital and she saw him on t v and he said all that junk to her next was that pretty gay story about the guy who brought back the dead people omg its so stupid i m not even going to say any more about it the last one was the best it wasn t that scary but the idea of the story was pretty cool uh yeah the girl gets possessed and she kills all her classmates or something then when they re all done telling their dreams to each other the losers get on the bus to hell ahahahah and they see all the people from their dreams on the bus ha the end
this entry is certainly interesting for series fans like myself but yet it is mostly incomprehensible the plot is confusing as is the sequel continuity some striking effects to be sure but we never find out what it all really means try to see the nc workprint version which contains the gore that was cut to be re rated r
this insipid mini operetta featuring a eddy mcdonald prototype in a valentino scenario is so bad it becomes an endurance exercise after five minutes it s silly from the get go as this brevity opens two military men discussing the lack of manliness in the son of one of the officers in under a minute he is packed off to morrocco where he lives a double life as the red shadow the leader of an arab tribe that would rather sing than fight alexander gray and bernice clare possess fine light opera voices with little acting ability and there s a decent bass in there as well but the acting is so haphazard scenes so ill prepared you get the feeling they are making things up as they go along this two reeler was part of a larger stage production that lists six writers with more room to spoof and warble the show may have had some entertainment values but this rushed quickie is little more than an insult to an audience waiting for the feature presentation
it saddens me to rate a movie with a lot of my favorite actors locations and genres i e douglas sutherland washington d c and political thriller but the sentinel really hits a low it s like they had a great idea up front signed the right cast and had some great city shots and then took a holiday letting the remaining crew improvise the rest and i wish i could blame it on yet another bland performance from basinger not only do i feel she s one of the worst actors in hollywood but i m still steaming more than a decade later that she was the only one and definitely the only bad actor in the film to win an acting oscar for l a confidential but she wasn t the only problem sutherland who i love as jack bauer on once again plays jack i miss his old a time to kill or a few good men days douglas certainly took a hiatus from acting and phoned this one in plot someone some secret service traitor wants the president dead and douglas is haphazardly being framed will someone believe him actually no spoiler here as quickly as they came up with that subplot half way through it s over before you know it and why did someone s want the president dead is that to be revealed in the sequel too many plot holes too many doors opened and never closed and too predictable the sentinel is if you only see one movie a year you may not know who the mole is but anyone who s familiar with these types of movies or even just seen one law order episode you ll know in the first few frames was it terrible not really the cinematography was good and despite sutherland playing jack again he s still got it
the strange people living in a town go about their lives there s the licker a guy who licks everything a dumpster diver that finds a body which he takes home to live with him a crazy girl with a doll dressed like her a guy who wants to cleanse girls of their wicked ways offbeat in the extreme this shot in black and white movie is better with out the color the monochrome takes the edge off the two steps up from home movie feel like a troma movie this movie is fun in fits and starts but mostly its weird for weirds sake and soon becomes a crashing bore since one you see the set ups you can kind of guess where its going a lot of the time not always but enough for it not to be fun though i didn t see the cleansing coming worth a shot if you ve nothing else to watch and you re waiting for the next set of golden girls to come from netflix
for a lot of time i was looking forward to see this movie here in latinamerica japanese or any oriental movies have no distribution in theaters we can find some of those movies in some underground stores and i just found avalon i was expecting something good but the only good thing in this movie is the first scene the rest of the movie is boring and senseless just plain stupid with a lot of useless scenes and a boring story i am wasting my time even writing about this film sorry but is the truth
a terrible storyline amis at his worst pointless and self conscious decadence obvious shock tactics and patchy acting make this film rather like rancid aluminium embody everything that went wrong with the much vaunted british film revival the humour is at best limp and the pretentiousness of the whole set up including some kind of internet terrorist group ooh how contemporary really begins to grate final summary a half baked attempt to be edgy that does no one any favours still it s always a pleasure to see katy carmichael on screen
i am sorry to say that it was one of the worst films i ve ever seen although visually fascinating e g the use of colour was absolutely stunning it was pretty boring and disturbing see the father son incest what s more music is totally absent and if you think of those wonderful soundtracks by michael nyman who wrote the soundtracks for most of greenaway s films then you can imagine what a difference it makes
i don t think you can get much worse then this put together bad actors fake limbs and three stupid stories and what do you get this b rate pointless excuse for a movie the first story immediately shows the bad video quality and the acting is just really pathetic especially when you bring in the year old posing as a grandma with the usually grandma bun over the ears bit plus the man is ok but the woman is rather ugly you look great not the werewolf in this one was the best one out of all three i d say but its still not impressive since it was all bad costume the face on the woman later was decent enough for halloween but not for a werewolf movie the more stories you go through the worse it gets there are two lesbians in this next one who are completely retarded its ridiculous the whole i want to be a werewolf too how could you do this to me was silly to say you asked for it now get over it the werewolf will not even be spoken of its a rat the third one has no point almost forty five minutes of running and boring narration make up this story and the whole switch thing still didn t make it interesting boring music yes bad who couldn t even hear some parts it was stupid animals effects were either rat or pig like which was stupid they couldn t use lion sounds guess not good movies use that well i f you enjoy b rates this is good for you i got this movie since i m a hardcore werewolf fan and i ll buy any werewolf movie and watch it more then once but thats just me if you prefer good ones don t waste your money i beg you
this is one of the very worst films clark gable made only parnell was obviously worse it is just so painfully clich d and the dialog is so lousy that it is something neither gable nor jean harlow should have been proud of making gable is a heel whose illegal activities result in his girl going to the slammer like the gangster talk she holds out hope that he ll do the right thing but he just leaves her there unknown to either of them gosh that she s in the family way eventually the rogue returns to do the right thing and somehow they tie this all together into a happy ending they seemed to have forgotten about gable s needing to take the rap and spend several years in the hoosegow leonard maltin says the stars are at their best here by what standard best at producing unintended chuckles gimme a break ps after saying this my wife thinks leonard maltin is going to find me and kick my butt hmmm however despite my comment i think mr maltin is the finest reviewer and human being on the planet i hope that appeased him update because i disliked this film so much the first time especially the ridiculous ending i decided to watch it once again after all sometimes when i watch a film again i like it much more and realize that i was a bit too harsh while that has been the case with several films in recent months i still disliked this film even the second time most of it was not because of the first half of the film in the first half harlow s character was amazingly stupid but at least it was believable but when she was sent to prison it was all clich s until the final ridiculous marriage scene occurred the bottom line is that this sequence is embarrassingly dumb it just makes no sense at all and is akin to turning the movie into some wacky fairy tale instead of a love story about two cons i stand by my original review despite all the not helpfuls and think that aside from parnell and possibly polly at the circus it might just be the worst gable film
after a few lean years was a pretty swell time for elvis not only did he make that celebrated comeback tv special but he also became a father and starred in two pretty decent movies as well speedway and live a little love a little therefore personally i can forgive him for the misstep that was stay away joe which at best emerges as an interesting misfire and is not all that bad considering sure burgess meredith and joan blondell are indeed embarrassing as respectively a dopey indian father to elvis character and a bawdy bartender who has her eye on mr presley too but one is glad to see elvis surrounded by top veteran hollywood talent like katy jurado as meredith s mexican wife the two jones henry and l q and thomas gomez who is particularly amusing as sarcastic chief thundercloud who is meredith s stubborn father still donning his old chieftain clothes in the present day while there is a surprising if not unwelcome given their usual blandness lack of songs there seems to be no shortage of free for all parties were the male indians hit the bottle steadily while presley practices his womanizing skills behind their backs as can be expected the typically western arizona scenery is a major asset here and the sleepy snoring bull gag is not only a good one but a major plot point on the other hand the climactic destruction of the house episode is one we ve seen too often since and doesn t work too well here
mst should do this movie it is the worst acted movie i have ever seen first of all you find out that the shooter has no bank account and no history since leaving the army in and pays his rent in cash there is no way in hell that a person like that would ever be allowed to be that close to a president not to mention a high profile job also the head of security for the pothus would not be so emotional that he would start drinking into a haze if the president was shot this movie sucked i cannot express the extremite that this movie was every single actor was terrible even the chick at the trailer park i crap on this garbage what a waste of time
a below average looking video game is turned into some sort of conspiracy to have the next terrorist discovered in the usa backyard welcome to the lunacy of cheaply made direct to video movies its full of no name actors and actresses with little valuable plot anyway this strange game goes on and our hero bets real money and does good at it it is sort of like gambling except the gambling part is gone and it sucks instead its an online game with little real value and you get authorities on your tail if you do good what makes it even stranger is that two strange computer programs battle it out somehow and all is saved in the end i will leave the viewer to see how it all comes to fruition overall not even worth a rental borrow it please d
got into this flick just as it was beginning on an afternoon where i was home with a touch of flu otherwise i d have missed it that probably would have been best i noticed the presence of lindsay crouse and jay thomas both very good performers and thought this might be worth a look it proved to be to some extent but only because it is one of those stories so awful it fascinates zoe mclellan has little to recommend her talents except for her jayne mansfield or loni anderson like bosom unfortunately her acting prowess at least here makes mansfield and anderson seem to be garbo or davis by comparison the young nut case s white rat the owner s cat the young nut case having the owner evicted and restrained in her own home and a bunch of doophus s including the young nut case running around a bio hazard facility and the absurd conclusion i kept waiting for at least some scene or plot element to contain at least a modicum of realism believability or being capable of evoking some empathy sympathy but this proved to be in vain
gritty dusty western from director richard brooks who seems thoroughly engrossed in the genre while keeping all the usual clich s intact early s horse race attracts a low keyed cowboy gene hackman a suave gambler james coburn a cocky kid jan michael vincent and even a female a surprisingly game candice bergen once the preliminaries are out of the way with the predictable arguments over whether or not a woman should take part this becomes a fairly engrossing entry though one which breaks no new ground it instead resembles something from gary cooper s era good looking if overlong piece has macho verve and a fine cast yet the mechanisms of the plot get tiresome rather quickly from
a sexually obsessed chef leads a duplicitous life one as a happily married man with a ten year oldish child the other as a sex fiend the bulk of the documentary like film follows him for five consecutive days and is told in flashback with nastassja kinski as a clinical sex therapist listening to his story and intelligently probing him nastassja s role is very restrictive and she is the only principal adult character who does not take off her clothes if she had i would have rated this movie a big fat f as it is it rates an f implying that it is still a failure unless one likes to be bored it is probably a lot more interesting to spend ninety minutes cleaning out the garage diary of a sex addict falls into the category of films that once one has seen it one wishes that one hadn t
a story of amazing disinterest kills the psychic over and over again the characters and plot are completely uninteresting as is fulci s mad camera work which is usually a redeeming factor in his films and any grasp of suspense is nowhere to be found it s padded out to an insufferable degree by the end you won t be clamoring with excitement but stricken with boredom and like me maybe an uncontrollable urge to fall asleep jennifer o neill s performance deserves occupancy in a better movie fulci gorehounds beware there s just not much going on in the psychic
i caught this film on azn on cable it sounded like it would be a good film a japanese green card i can t say i ve ever disliked an asian film quite the contrary some of the most incredible horror films of all time are japanese and korean and i am a huge fan of john woo s hong kong films i an not adverse to a light hearted films like tampopo or chung king express two of my favourites so i thought i would like this well i would rather slit my wrists and drink my own blood than watch this laborious badly acted film ever again i think the director steven okazaki must have spiked the water with quaalude because no one in this film had a personality and when any of the characters did try to act as opposed to mumbling a line or two their performance came across as forced and incredibly fake i honestly did not think that anyone had ever acted before the only person who sounded genuine was brenda aoki i find it amazing that this is promoted as a comedy because i didn t laugh once even more surprising is that cbs morning news called this a refreshing breath of comedy it was neither refreshing nor a breath of comedy and the ending was very predictable the previous reviewer must be an idiot to think such things avoid this film unless you want to see a boring predictable plot line and wooden acting i actually think that spike of bensonhurst is a better acted film than this and i walked out half way through that film
this was the worst christmas movie i ever saw i took my two small children to see this it was the darkest most dismal plot family has no money mom loses her job father gets killed in the bank bank robber steals family car with both kids in the back and after high speed chase drives off the bridge and drowns them in the river mom is left all alone no wonder her christmas spririt is gone christmas angels do not rescue children that have drowned and santa does not bring back dead fathers i thought this was the worst message to send children better to tell them that there is no santa than show them a movie like this
gymkata is without a doubt one of the worst movies ever made but not the bad kind of bad movies this one is so awful it s fun to watch and laugh kurt thomas clearly does not have a lucrative career in acting he should go back to gymnastics but who can forget such memorable scenes as the high bar with chalk the stone pommel horse or the five minute chase scene through the village of the crazies in slow motion i don t think it was meant to be this bad but who can tell it s not art but if you want something lite and fluffy that will make a good conversation rent gymakta makes for an evening of fun
so it starts with a beautiful old house in the country you have a group of people who get asked to come to this house and not surprisingly the caretakers always lock the gates at night for no apparent reason anywhoo the people laugh joke etc this dr tells them a spooky story of this woman and some kids they get scared they start to feel stuff oh no a girl see s s ghost some more talking then this huge ghost comes and etc etc this girl finds out that this ghost killed little kids and that she must free their souls yeah yeah blah blah she does but oh no she dies as she does and goes to heaven whilst this evil ghost goes to hell two people survive and escape the house the script is terrible because a guy gets his head chopped off and elanor the one who dies saving the kids says oh no the acting is wooden the effects are crap and the set is a couple off rooms used over and over again basically if you like laughing at badly made films watch it but if your looking for a scare then definitely give this film a miss i was extremely disappointed when i watched this a very big let down my sister who gets sacred very easily got bored in this film it is appalling
blood legacy starts with the arrival of lawyer tom drake norman bartold to the dean estate formerly owned by the now deceased christopher dean john carradine upon his arrival he is greeted by mr dean s four children gregory jeff morrow his wife laura merry anders victoria faith domergue johnny richard davalos plus leslie brooke mills her fella carl isenberg john smith drake plays a tape recording of they re late father s wishes after his death the estate worth million dollars is to be split equally between his four children if any should die then the money would be split equally between the rest if all were to die the freaky servants elga ivy bethune igor buck kartalian the more mundanely named frank john russell would pocket the lot well not satisfied with a quarter share of million which is still almost million back in which doesn t sound too bad to me someone decides they want it all for themselves it s not long before decapitated heads are turning up in the fridge co written produced directed by roy monson blood legacy disappointed me on two accounts for starters this film s alternate much more common title is legacy of blood which is also the title of an obscure horror film directed by andy milliagn back in which i ve always wanted to see both films are regularly mixed up as both have similar stories when i checked my on screen cable tv guide for legacy of blood i was excited because it said it was the milligan film even listed him as director so when i actually sat down to watch it i heard john carradine s voice i then knew it wasn t the milligan film that i had wanted to see my heart sank then of course there s the simple yet undeniably straight forward fact that blood legacy is a total utter piece of crap that is literally painful to watch at times the script by monson eric norden is slow boring extremely predictable the character s are absolutely bizarre in an annoying way the freak of a servant who ask s his sister to cane him the strange set of brother s sisters who are just downright unlikeable so far removed from reality that any tension or mystery that the simplistic whodunit story could have achieved is sorely missing then there s the awful twist ending that you can guess within the first minutes it s boring to watch it s poorly paced it s just a chore to even think about it please someone save me as this is really bad stuff i could go on all day about how bad blood legacy is i really could director monson was either working with a none existent budget or judging by this he shouldn t have even been directing traffic the entire film looks ugly it s poorly photographed there is no atmosphere or scares the blood gore is tame there s an axe in a head a decapitated head a scene when someone is stung to death by wasp s the best murder when someone s face is eaten by piranha however there are question marks over this scene so there s the victim right there s the tank of piranha right victims head is placed in piranha tank right pirahna eat victims face right water remains crystal clear despite said victim having his face eaten erm where s the blood technically blood legacy is terrible it looks awful the sound was obviously shot live it s muffled hard to hear which considering the terrible dialogue is maybe a blessing in disguise the acting was not going to win anyone any awards that s for sure the least said about it the better blood legacy is an awful film there really isn t a single positive aspect to it or if there is i can t think of it do yourself a favour don t bother with this one there are much better films out there
the british claymation series putting witty conversations taped from average people in the mouths of cute fanciful creatures at least had the advantage for non british viewers of seeming droll and the kind of rarefied cultured humor you couldn t get on u s television someone made the mistake of putting it on u s television sort of like the sadly miscast american version of the sublime brit com coupling which died in a month on nbc when the same basic scripts didn t translate from british english to american english what seemed droll and cultured and just a bit dull in england comes across in creature comforts the american version as simply boredom with puppets there s no through plot line no characters and after one and a half episodes watched of the three ultimately aired no reason to suffer through more the only positive thing to be said about the new summer series and the mercifully brief run it had is that the claymation is at least professionally done and coming as a set up for the single worst show on the cbs schedule the new adventures of old christine or how to be a horrible mother or person in one interminable unfunny lesson kids who wanted to stay up past their bedtime happily ran to bed rather than sit through this show and the adults could wait to tune in until pm when two and a half men guilty pleasure and how i met your mother actual quality writing come on
caught this by accident on a t v showing and could hardly believe how utterly awful the whole experience was by comparison the original a man called horse was spell binding because it held one s interest throughout but this piece of nonsense words fail me it was bad enough to have some kind of a story presented with all the impact of a wet loaf of bread but that error was compounded by the obvious lack of subtitles throughout whenever the so called sioux spoke for goodness sake couldn t the film makers have found enough north american indians who were also actors and near actors to perform as indians in this farrago instead of the imposters they actually used i also found it quite embarrassing watching richard harris cavorting all around the countryside at the obvious behest of the director standing just behind camera telling him to run and jump from pointless point a to pointless point b just to make up film footage and minutes absolutely terrible in all respects
a quite usual trashy italo western stupid storyline full of clich s and lack of logic some mediocre actors dirty settings lots of punch fights and people shoot dead on a massive scale this has nothing to do with django at least not in my german translated version this german dvd release is called adios companeros and has macho callaghan fighting against butch cassidy and ironhead because their gang killed his one he s the only survivor then you have butch cassidy and ironhead fighting each other because they quarreled and the gang split and you have ironhead fighting against everyone because he s just the biggest and most greedy asshole anyway yeah that s it no more cleverness in the storyline hehe a small role by klaus kinski as reverend cotton is remarkable that s why i bought this dvd in one scene he attempts to separate two men fighting by hitting them and screaming i said love and in another scene he wins a competition in throwing horseshoes and goes nuts for a second fantasticfantasticfantastic it s also remarkable that joe d amato aka aristide massaccesi did the cinematography i love this master of incompetent exploitation thrash so it was an aahhh for me
this screwy comedy seems very forced indeed the actors try very hard to make a go of an essentially unfunny script and as a result it doesn t really go anywhere the idea of a woman finding out she was pregnant after getting a quickie divorce just isn t all that funny and then when cooper sneaks off with the baby because he doesn t want it put up for adoption just seems terribly unfunny and it s really pushing hard to turn this into a comedy it s really a shame too as the actors were more capable than the script and i found myself just bored by the whole mess considering that cooper made so many good comedies i recommend you see them instead
this film was slated to be a blockbuster film and it really is this is the type of movie that is made to eat popcorn to and watch the flashy graphics with that in mind the movie delivers perhaps not as well as the ultra flashy iron man but well enough outside of the popcorn munching action and special effects the film drops off of the cliff faster than wile e coyote many viewers myself included will complain about how most of the characters were severely altered but that only makes the film a poor adaptation not a poor film this film is unsatisfactory for other reasons the makers focused more on making it appealing to the eye than they did to the mind the characters that have been long awaited and promoted are reduced to scene cameos the main characters of wolverine victor creed never called sabertooth in the film and colonel stryker are well developed i was pleasantly surprised by liev schriber s performance the rest of the characters are tossed to the wayside to make way for the all important eye candy wolverine s character is fully developed after minutes as is sabertooth though victor does pull off some surprises late in the film the final boss of the film is a twisted and perverse adaptation of the original character and barely gets any development to show just why he is the way he is the filmmakers obviously felt that all they really needed to do was create a bad ass character who could do anything they wanted and slapped on the name of a popular character very disappointing
i heard many stories about this film being great well i took my chance when i saw it for a cheap price at ebay last month i watched it and i have only a few comments about it terrible story line terrible acting bad fighting scenes i never seen any worse movie in my life so far when the storyline is bad than at least make the fights something more interesting but both are done ridiculously bad the only positive thing about this movie in my opinion is nikki berwick god she looks nice in this movie that s about it
i have never read the bradbury novel that this movie is based on but from what i ve gathered it will be interesting when i finally do read it and i will my comments will be based purely on the film as soon as i saw the trailer i knew i had to see it and was so excited but when i finally did i was so disappointed it hurt this is because the movie itself felt so amateurish the actors were not well cast though robards and pryce are both good actors just not here the kid actors it seemed were merely asked to show up get in the characters clothes say the lines and make the faces the set and props were cheap and unrealistic the direction was surprisingly bad i was so surprised at the awfulness of it that i had to go online and check who directed it just to see the kind of work he had done the editing was cut and paste and the plot screenplay was just that as well even though the author had been involved himself irony the building up of the tension fear and suspense was so mild it was ineffective when the climax finally came i ve read some of the comments on this movie and find it hard to believe people actually like it what hurts the most is that the content is interesting and fun and intriguing it had so much potential unfortunately the film was so technically bad it takes away from the brilliance of the story
i did not expect much from this film but boy o boy i did not expect the movie to be this bad chris rock is not showing a good act here you can t get the feeling that his caracter is real i think the movie would have been a bit better if it s drama or romantic scenes would have been a less part of the movie and more better humor was involved the movie is like the film makers were having a bad hangover making it in the making of they don t show a single smile this is a very bad film i gave it three out of ten because of few smiles it gave me but i did never laugh
the rookie suffers from so much there are the random musical songs interspersed through the movie the long pointless script and enough grating slapstick to make jerry lewis blush noonan and leavitt just don t know when to quit it takes a full hour before the story finally gets to the main plot and the characters are shipwrecked then the guys start playing japanese sailors with the standard racist caricature of the day it is a shame the funniest parts of the movie are when noonan and leavitt are playing the stupid stereotyped japanese guys but it gets pretty tiring after switching back and forth between two sets of characters then it just abruptly ends even a naked julie newmar in a towel can t save this one there is really little charm in the movie and it is over a half hour too long the story just flounders along trying to set up funny situations and failing stick to martin lewis at least deano had charm and jerry had that animated face
while being one of the stars of this film doesn t necessarily give me sage insight i do know quite a bit of what was first there and what ended up on the screen i remember seeing the original cut of incoming freshman and being very pleased it was funny sexy raunchy all the main requirements of a drive in film you have to remember this was shot and released before all the rest animal house porky s etc so in its own way this flick was truly ahead of its time for whatever reasons the film was given to the main distributors who editing out half the original film and then edited in should i say shuffled the most random scenes ever the fat guy the people with goat heads what the heck was all that i m sure it was put in for additional t a but it was so slowly paced it caused anything going on prior to it to grind to a screeching and painful halt but all in all it s a fun memory for me especially in that i m able to say that the worst movie i ve ever seen i m in
what a dreadful movie for some reason scientific laboratories and outposts always have a staff of grubby dirty mean spirited misanthropes living inside these folks who presumably work together on complicated scientific projects cannot seem to agree on how to survive death at the hands of a cgi dragon spoilers an extra nasty scientist whose main acting skill is leering and the sinister stare has cloned a dragon while the lab was supposed to work on this kind of thing the other scientists are shocked because apparently they were all way behind in their experiments and got caught with their pants down the rest of the story is like the thing or ten little indians where the staff is hunted and killed off as they try to formulate a way to escape and or defeat the dragon the cgi dragon creature is dark gray which seems to be the popular color for most of the cheap cgi special effects it hardly looks better than a cartoon and the dark gray tones make it difficult to see any interesting details in the body of the dragon all it looks like is a gray blob the acting is less than horrible these scientists act like a bunch of children who cannot agree on anything and this makes it easier for the dragon to kill them off in various attempts to escape hide etc dean cain is hardly better than any of the cast of unknown actors in this movie he seems to sink to the level of his supporting cast this movie is really really atrocious the acting is bad the story is dumb the cgi is very very cheap and amateurish there is nothing commendable about this movie it is not even a good time killer to glance at while doing chores or other work
i picked this dvd up at the dollar store the dvd was on the for rack but since it had michael madsen in it i thought that since i had never seen the movie i bought it anyway i must say that i didn t like the movie the movie played more like a documentary or an advertisement for religion than anything else i found that the director s use of flashbacks did not add to the story line for me i would have preferred to view the story line in chronological order i won t throw it away like one of the other commentators but it may be quite awhile before i would consider watching this movie again who knows since it was michael madsen s film debut maybe it might have some archival value at some future date
people please don t bother to watch this movie this movie is bad it s totally waste of time i don t see any point here it s a stupid film with lousy plot and the acting is poor i rather get myself beaten than watch this movie ever again
in hollywood in the s and s i think that every studio can make a western except warner bros the few times they try it always ridiculous except perhaps for they died with their boots on which is a cavalery western i have read that humphrey bogart seing james cagney with this big cowboy hat on his head said that he looks like a mushroom true cagney and bogart are too urban too xxe century to be credible in a western movie the story here had no suprise and it did t help every minutes i figure i can see bogart and cagney drops their little guns and put hands in a machine gun to get away from the set in a s black car
if i could i would give zero stars for this one but unfortunately i have to give one there is no single scene i could laugh about but the game didn t make me laugh either so if you re some ill retarded folk go to your local cinema watch this movie and give it stars like some people here already did but for me in a movie where children are shot dead to achieve humor good taste goes over the edge this was the third time i wasted my time to see a boll movie and it was definitely my last i m ashamed of being from the same country as uwe boll please please keep him from making more movies
italian horror suspense film about a wealthy english lord who cruises pubs and taverns for girls with red hair just like his recently deceased wife evelyn you know he must have really loved his wife because he brings them to his home a huge rotting castle and makes them disrobe and then tortures them whips them and kills them the most bizarre aspect of this film for me was that somehow by the film s end we see this guy played by antonio de teffe as the hero of the film anyway soon under the advice of his playboy uncle roberto maldera de teffe settles down with a girl he meets at his uncle s party she moves in and strange things begin to happen to de teffe s fragile state of mind he begins to see and hear his dead wife and finally well just look at the title if you are still curious also family members and friends begin to die in the most brutal fashions poor aunt agatha she looks like she might even be younger than de teffe and they have her in a wheelchair and trying to look old meets her fate in a foxy fashion another man is injected and then buried alive and of course there is a whole explanation as to why how evelyn did what she did director emilio miraglia does do some things fairly well the settings in the film are well suited for this film though trying to make us believe it is england is ludicrous at best none of the actors look english many having dark black hair and mediterranean complexions and wearing clothes an englishman wouldn t be caught dead in the cars drive on their wrong side of the road but all that notwithstanding the crypt scene was effectively shot and i liked the cheesy resolution too and of course any film with the sultry red headed erika blanc is always a plus there is a streak of sexual perversion however which i found somewhat appalling with the idea that torturing women was quite alright and healthy in order to relieve one of his mental demons c mon
where to start ok don t compare this film to fight club for a start ridiculous if it was even a patch on fight club the violence blood gore etc would be much more evident and realistic secondly this film is no football factory which is so much more real and danny dyer makes nicholas nickelby look like an embarrassment fair enough the storyline is quite decent and the fight scenes are well choreographed with a decent ending i might add but the film on the whole is poor seriously poor as people have been mentioning the accents should not spoil a film i disagree either a simple casting error or a lack of effort in coaching the voices caused the film to be irritating all the way through it was obvious from scene one some american geordie was playing the role don t get me wrong good looking guy who looks great with a skin head but no not a football hooligan i could go on forever about how ridiculous the football scene was the fake steward situation also when the gse are going to play united up north they go on the train expecting only of them doesn t make any sense this a real organisation of gangsters and thugs which is portrayed in the film to be some mickey mouse cult of about people in terms of accuracy did west ham and milwall not play for the last couple of years they have been in the championship together hmm ten years ok and i m sure bother would be able to just waltz into a milwall firm pub basically a very poor film which people will like if they have little knowledge of real football and hooliganism if you do actually love football and are intrigued by the underworld of hooliganism you will simply feel as though this film has insulted your intelligence ross george
there are no spoilers here because there is no plot to spoil madchen amick is living proof a face can make a living acting no talent required the only bright spot are a few really good one liners delivered very nicely by alice krige but then again she is alice krige her soft dreamy voice gives the only hint at just how seductively dangerous these odd creatures can be she is believably creepy in this otherwise unbelievable plot how they got her to agree to this project remains a mystery the screenplay writers must have been medicated when they submitted this script it has major continuity problems superficial stereotypical characters horror formula writing and simply falls short of making any sense what so ever the creatures while they have neat skills like going dim the question of where they come from and what they are is never so much explored don t waste any time on this one
i rarely write reviews for imdb com but i feel compelled to warn potential viewers that this movie is terrible just terrible i like shaw bros movies i m not a hater and i had high expectations for this one since i found it listed on many best kung fu martial arts movies websites i m now convinced that those best lists are all cut and paste jobs first of all there s barely any action in the film most of the movie consists of talking about the plot which is an amazing feat because it s thin at best and the action itself may have been impressive back in but it s routine by today s standards a special warning to netflix users the dvd they ship is terrible the picture is horrendous and it s not even enhanced
i personally hated this movie because it was predictable the characters were stereotypical and the whole idea was a rip off of the cutting edge and cadet kelly the main character is a snotty girl who gets shipped of to a place where she doesn t belong the whole place hates her and to make things worse there is a hot guy that seemingly doesn t like her well duh the whole damn school can t stand you amazingly she finds a way to fit in and make everyone to like her plus gets the guy to fall head over heels in love with her then comes the choice where she must choose between figure skating and hockey she chooses hockey then she goes to the figure skating nationals and gets to be on the olympic team no real surprise there this whole movie was so damn predictable you knew what was going to happen before you even saw it this was so awful i nearly puked and by the time i was finished watching it i had an awful headache and the urge to shoot myself for watching such crap don t watch this unless you are under ten or actually like crappy tween movies
i was excited to view a catalu a s film in the berlin s competition but after the presentation i was total disappointed and furious too much blood too much time too much themes for nothing the spanish civil war like every war was horrible the revenge a very human behavior not pretty at all is shown in uncountable films and plays as well as the relations between homosexuals and the scepticism in spain about catholicism but what mr villaronga try is a pseudo tragedy that can belongs to the worst of the film s history it is really a pity to see angela molina in this movie i advise nobody under no circumstances to go to see this film
i m afraid that i have to disagree with the majority i found spike lee s latest a wee bit boring although he was trying something different i e not just documenting the rise and fall of the serial killer i don t think it worked too well there s really a bit too much going on vinny john leguizamo and dionna s mira sorvino relationship ritchie s adrien brody lifestyle and then the local mafia types the story is good but at the end thats all you have or stories with such a provocative killer could mr lee not have put more into that side of the film there are some good points though all scenes with the son of sam killer david berkowitz look very nice colour saturation etc and the acting is pretty good throughout overall i felt that the different stories would of worked well on their own or else without the killings it just wasn t strong enough in the end
this movie is absolutely pointless one of the good esamples how malcom mcdowall never got one decent role after clockwork orange this one may be one of the worst though no story crappy special effects shot in or even worse cropped on dvd just avoid it
a guy thing tries to capture the feeling of there s something about mary or meet the parents but comes off more like it was edited up out of cutting room rejects of those two films thankfully i rented it on a day rental because i couldn t sit and watch more than minutes at a time the premise is decent and i liked the scenes where other guys automatically cover up for paul s missteps the checker at the save mart was great but the script writing is absolutely horrible the dialog falls flat most of the time and just when you think that things are finally going to get on track some needless sight gag is stuck in for no good reason plus how many toilet jokes does one movie really need don t get me wrong slapstick humor is great when it s smartly done as in the other films i mentioned but this movie simply misses the mark too bad as i love julia stiles ten things i hate about you was great but even that couldn t help me sit through this terrible movie save your dollars and go rent there s something about mary one more time
how does a scotsman in a kilt make love in the bonny purple heather very very carefully now i have the distinct advantage over many other of the reviewers in that i was born in scotland far too many americans take this simplistic nonsense seriously it s a joke people four legs good two legs bad as orwell had it jessica lange has an accent that the wells next the sea amateur dramatic society s production of brigadoon would turn down liam neeson apparently popular with the ladies wears his kilt with all the authority of a man whose great grandmama once stepped off the train at edinburgh waverley and the auld enemy where would the scots be without them to hate and blame for everything messrs roth cox and hurt should be ashamed for indulging in such racist stereotyping robin hood prince of thieves seems a masterpiece of historical accuracy in comparison and at least alan rickman was funny
this movie is another one on my list of movies not to bother with saw it years ago as an adolescent stayed up late to do so was very annoyed to find that it was about romance everything else history if that it s what i call a bait and switch movie one with an interesting title the actual movie is a scam this is a subject which deserves a good cinematic treatment this movie is almost an insult to those who served the actual members of the lafayette escadrille were not on the run from the law nor were they the products of abusive homes they were in reality idealists who wanted to do something to help france and i suspect many of them came from a more upper class background than tab hunter s character flying school is not for the smart alecks and the know it alls an individual such as the one portrayed here wouldn t have lasted two days it would have either been the stockade or the infantry discipline in the french army was often rather fierce in short another hollywierd version of an historical episode that deserves proper treatment
a group of friends come face to face with a family of hideous cannibals whilst camping in the beautiful german countryside the mutant cannibal family concept is almost as old as the hills that the inbred freaks often call home so any director attempting to breath new life into the genre needs to come up with something pretty darn special in order to impress with barricade timo rose tries to give the well worn routine a teutonic twist by transplanting the action to the black forest and giving it the german low budget splatter treatment the result is a very bloody but totally unoriginal effort that is made almost unwatchable thanks to some dreadful directorial decisions in particular the non stop use of fancy filters and irritating editing techniques had timo rose not opted to utilise every naff trick his editing software offered him then barricade might have been a reasonably entertaining gore fest his inexperienced cast do reasonably well the bloody effects are suitably stomach churning and there are one or two scares and even some well conceived creepy moments all of this however is completely ruined by the awful camera work choppy editing and overwhelming barrage of visual gimmickry used to give the film the distressed look that is so inexplicably popular with today s film makers i give barricade out of purely for the outlandish gore which includes a nifty scene where a guy is forced to drink acid loads of nasty wounds caused by a variety of sharp implements and some pretty decent shotgun damage
loony tunes have ventured at least twice into the future the first time was with the brilliantly funny duck dodgers the latter time was with this um effort loonatics unleashed isn t without merit and might be considered a good product were it not that it isn t up to warner brothers quality wb cartoons are noted for their cheeky humor appealing at least as much to adults as to children these pedestrian superhero episodes on the other hand cannot fail to convince adults to pass them up the premise of the series is that ordinary individuals bunnies a tasmanian devil a duck a roadrunner and a coyote live on the city planet of acmetropolis and acquire super powers when a meteor strikes the planet in what s confusing is that the titles section features these individuals with a count up to from the st century cute but frelling stupid in each episode the super sextet amid mildly amusing but essentially banal banter fight various super villains for the most part these are types that appear in every mediocre superhero adventure series and even some of the better ones like many mediocre superhero series this one takes its villains far too seriously for the context and of course these guys are the only characters that laugh the usual evil laugh of course why is it that villains in predictable superhero adventures always always laugh evilly at every opportunity animated material of this sort seems to leave laughter exclusively in the province of villains and occasionally their henchpeople and or henchthings in point of fact the makers of this series missed their best bets right from the get go the superpowers of the characters are sometimes based on their previous normal abilities but sometimes not the problem here is that we don t see enough wb looniness lexi and ace have fairly ordinary biologically generated energy weapons and have virtually no personality traits one could describe as bugs like what we have here is basically the silly and drekish teen titans including its overly modern animation look but with animals feh the other misstep by the program s creators is or are the villains as noted before these are not terribly imaginative and do the evil laugh bit excessively amazingly the writers totally missed the obvious technique of making villains from stock wb characters as well as the protagonists adding to the fun could have been say jupiter sam as well as the fudd still hunting wabbits as well as tech e coyote converted into a really neurotic villain and so on ah the sadness of missed opportunities sadly this whole production has gone into too much overtime that is a nd season nevertheless we can rejoice that there s something new out there for the going on crowd the rest of us can hope for a rd season of duck dodgers
i just saw this movie yesterday i cannot believe the reviews on this site the ones that give it over one star must be buffy fanatics well i am a buffy fan of the first order but i know crap when i see it on every level this film is terrible technically much of the time you don t know where you are in this movie even within one scene it jumps pov like crazy for no reason no logic whatsoever in cinematic terms emotionally is bleak for bleak s sake and attempts to be a psychological thriller when it is just confusing throwing nasty looking red necks in your movie is a cheap way to convey atmosphere i ran out of patience with it a long time before the last act but i was having too much fun with my friends doing mst k riffs to turn it off since leaving buffy smg has had successful movies if even listing scooby doo on your resume could count gellar is a fine actress but she or her agent sure can t find a vehicle for her and mr shepard if you are having trouble paying your mortgage i ll send you a few bucks if you promise to not appear in a movie like this again also the estate of patsy cline should sue for defamation
i give this movie a as it is worse than the cult movies that deserve a proper it does not make sense to you well it doesn t have to this is another vampire movie with a stupid plot no let me rephrase incredibly idiotic plot where space cowboys complete with cowboy hats battle a space race of moron vampires does it get any uglier than this the only good thing in this movie was natassia malthe with her stunning norwegian beauty god i wish michael ironside and the deluise brothers would stop accepting dumb roles in dumb movies i mean at least seaquest was nice i know mr ironside from a lot of movies he has acted in movies at this date it s true that he was rarely in a major role but still
this star studded british spanish co production looks great what you can see of it i have three versions two vhs one dvd and all are terribly cropped so badly that it looks as if buildings are having conversations with each other few films suffer as badly from pan and scan as this one as director robert parrish seems to have been so enamored with the widescreen process that he tended to use both sides of the screen at once neglecting the middle another user comments that we see the entire inhabitants of a church massacred at the beginning not in any of the copies i have there are some abrupt cuts of peasants firing their rifles one mexican officer is shot shaw and landau celebrating and that s it we never find out why shaw has become a priest if he really is we never find out what happens to don carlos savalas although i suspect he was called home to star in kojak as his departure seems arbitrary and there is a strange flashback sequence where michael craig mysterious island is dancing around in a bowler hat and bad suit in the great old english music hall tradition to the hit battle of new orleans not sung by johnny horton here but with some lyrics i ve never heard before on the plus side the location is great a huge old ruined fortress with escher style stairs leading nowhere some nice scenery chewing by robert shaw and good performances by stevens landau lettieri and telly savalas as telly savalas i didn t really like this film but i haven t exactly seen it i will seek the widescreen version and make my decision then
this movie is a re write of the warren beatty movie heaven can wait but it is written for the stand up comedic style of mr rock the premise remains the same lance barton rock is taken before his life time is up and works a deal with god s representative mr king to come back to earth as someone else as in beatty s movie he chooses the murdered charles wellington a rich white man all because he fancies sontee jenkins regina king who happens to turn up at wellington s house during the murder the role of mrs wellington and her lover suffers in this remake and the idea to turn an aged white multi millionaire into a stand up black comedian who tries to woo sontee simply does not work also the intercuts used to show rock as wellington and then as the real white wellington fail miserably improvements could have been made to the original beatty plot which in itself did not masterfully portray the life after death idea but they certainly were not to be found in down to earth
this documentary begins with an interesting premise it makes an intriguing and convincing argument that the history of jesus as is commonly believed is probably a myth sadly though after priming us with this the movie completely shifts gears and becomes little more than a non stop attack on christianity and pretty much focusing on the easy targets the writer director clearly has some issues with the church he is a former evangelical christian and has some legit anger and this film seems to be his form of release it d be interesting to see the first minutes expanded but as a whole the movie is disappointing
over the last years the majority of british films are about how horribly poverty stricken the uk is and how our youth doesn t stand a chance of a good life whilst they live on the mean streets of british cities the british film industry is obsessed with the idea of broken britain trainspotting this is england kidulthood football factory kes and from london to brighton bullet boy is just another british movie added to that list the main character expresses a desire to go straight yet he still insists on hanging around with dead beats who carry guns and fight with gang members over nothing i was never convinced that he did want to go straight as there was nothing stopping him pursuing an education or a trade in fact it would have been a breath of fresh air if he had of gone straight and we had a character who turned his life around instead he spends his time helping his friend trying to commit murder i felt no sympathy when he is predictably shot by another teen at the end of the film which is sad because at the beginning of the film i really liked the entire family and their desire for success i believe the makers missed a great chance to show the world that success belongs to those who are willing to really strive for it like the pursuit of happiness i know the purpose of this film was to try and paint a realistic picture of what life is like for black teens living in working class areas of britain but don t we already have enough films in the uk with that very same plot isn t it time these talented producers and writers give britains youth something to aspire to and show them a better life is just around the corner i applaud the makers of bullet boy for not loading the film full of mindless violence in order to try and get success through shock factors like kidulthood football factory but at the same time this movie offers nothing new to a long list of british films that are effectively dull and depressing to watch there is no happy ending to this movie or any of the others i have mentioned
oh man this thing scared the heck out of me when i first watched it and i was sixteen that creepy animated barbie is scary as hell i want to stop talking about her now
you can call this one a flop and that s a very big one too quality isn t associated with the words national lampoon but at least the vacation and animal house entries were fun but this offering has got to be their most inane feature to date that i ve watched ugh the three piece story crazily attempts to parody the clich s and stereotypes that flooded hollywood genre films which turns out to be completely unfunny and boorish dross growing yourself jason a corporate lawyer decides to quit his job and split up with his wife so they both can grow and do what they always wanted to do that s life as jason sees it and he takes over looking after the children but his decision to follow this path might not be the right one talk about leaden boring and stiff there only real interest is the small performance of the lovely diane lane the satirical element here seems to be pointing out something than actually just delivering it the silly humour is strained flat and particularly senseless peter riegert s keeps it very deadpan in the lead role and teresa ganzel bubbles along in her role success wanters after just finishing collage dominique corsair gets a job as a stripper and is rape with some butter by the dairy company presidents for payback she becomes interested in the margarine industry and virtually works her way to the very top probably the best one of the three but the competition wasn t too great the gags seem to want go more subtle with its sexual and power orientated tone but still they do feel more tacky and forced the idea had something promising and inventive to build on but the languid pacing begins to wear thin by the end and disastrous dialogue don t do it any favours at all the humour tries but more often doesn t come off despite the hunger the seductively ann dusenberry is pretty cold and manipulative throughout well after the painful ordeal and likes to gracefully bare it all quite a bit even the skimpy stripper outfit seems to get full workout for the opening half of the story popping up in amusing minor cameos ranged from dick millar mary woronov olympia dukakis fred willard robert culp and a favourite turn by joe spinell municipalians a serial killer who leaves copies of his driver s licence behind after each murder is being tracked down by an enthusiastically naive rookie cop and his old grizzled partner however the young cop learns that being tough is the only way to go when the pair encounter one situation after another stupid oh yeah sure if you re going to spoof something extremely over the top make sure laughter will stream off it obviously they forgot that even at its minutes running boy does it drag robby benson s gratingly mock performance got rather overbearing with a wearied richard widmark doing very little as his partner christopher lloyd underplays the role of serial killer but his creepily wry and sympathetic performance works well and pretty much shows up the other leads elisha cook jr rhea perlman and harry reems appear when the jokes come they truly feel out of sync and get rather stale with its repetitiveness of making fun of these cop clich s in all the idiotic material laced with its skits comes across as disposable and the unbearable script is basically inept and witless only one or two few gags make it out each segment but really there s too many cheap stinkers or plain misses which stick in your head this is because it virtually becomes what it s trying to poke fun at and this basically shows in each story it loses sight the performances range from hot to cold but who can t deny the embarrassment that s felt on most of their faces director bob giraldi s first taste is a vapid one for growing yourself but success wanters showed some minor flourishes of mild effectiveness henry jaglom does a labouredly jaded job on municipalians rick meyerowitz s vividly crass drawings that opens the film are neatly devised and go on to set the style and mood this low brow comedy flunks it by overplaying it with the main interested being derived by the familiar cameos but really is it worth going through this putridly lame and restless get up just to spot them well that s up to you
the real irony is this joe besser was a top notch comedian in other situations away from the stooges he had a definite track record for being very funny and clever moe and larry and shemp had actually known him or at least of him for many years and liked his work so what on earth was going on when he joined the troop as the third stooge obviously nothing in most of these late stooge era shorts more often than not the boys are pitted against each other or joe against the other two and this is not accurate stooge etiquette one for all all for one every man for himself to quote curly from restless knights one thing about a good comedy team laurel hardy abbott costello the marx brothers no matter how much they all try to take advantage of each other or slap each other around when the chips are actually down they stick together and come to each other s aid in this particular one none of that happens it s almost like watching a dog fight as one tries to cheat the others or be mean and nasty and not for comedic effect either one might assume that there was something behind the scenes going on here art imitates life maybe there really was hence why besser did not stay very long with moe and larry just look at the history of the other teams and tell me i m wrong
i agree with those reviews i have read here and i have no words to define such a turkey like this but despite everything i still can find a reason for movies like this to exist do you remenber those happy days in which video was a prosperous business and a lot of movies were made with the only reason of filling the shelves of the video stores this movie comes from that period and i can imagine that was the only reason for which it was produced and the same happened with many many many other stinkers do you remember rambo imitations and so many slashers of z grade i still feel nostalgia for that period about this movie i can say i didn t waste my time watching it because i pressed the fast forward button after the first fifteen minutes just to find a very funny scene in which a guy was pushing an axe against heads which exploded because as you perfectly notice they were made of plastic and about the end well it was so badly filmed i could not understand what happened that s the same i had not followed the non existing plot at all but boy video age was a great age despite movies like this
i have seen a lot of movies this is the first one i ever walked out of the theater on don t even bother renting it this is about as boring a soap opera as one can see at least you don t have to pay to watch a soap opera though
i have never commented on imdb before but i feel i have to after watching the batman animation its absolute rubbish warner brothers had the perfect animation series in batman in the early s so what the hell are they doing trying to mess with the winning formula i feel like writing a complaint letter to wb the original animation was dark and brooding exactly the way batman was intended to be wb had to mess this up with some tripe batman of the future now they produce this drivel the joker doesn t remotely resemble the joker from dc comics dc should sue i urge everyone who agrees with me to email or write to wb and use people power to get back the original formula
if you want to watch a real quality movie get hold of the eden formula this wondrous film must have cost all of to make it features a wafer thin script pathetically bad sets lighting and camera work and a stop motion paper mache monster that is utterly laughable it looks like they sometimes used a guy in a rubber suit and or a glove puppet for the monster but all were equally dreadful the actors all speak their lines as though they ve never seen them before and are reading off a teleprompter the special effects are way beyond lousy and the only sad thing is that they dropped the really nifty original title tyranasaurus wrecks which sums up exactly what you get for the full minutes this is what happens when you scrape the bottom of the barrel so hard you break through to the crud that lies underneath i loved every minute of it
oh my bad clothing worse synth music and the worst david hasselhoff the s are back with vengeance in witchery an american italian co production helmed by infamous joe d amato on the production side and short careered director thank heavens for small miracles fabrizio laurenti directing marketed as a kind of sequel to sam raimi s evil dead series in italy that was dubbed la casa in there witchery delivers some modest gore groceries and bad acting a mix of ghost story possessions and witchcraft the film bounces clueless from scene to another without letting some seriously wooden actors and hilarious day and night mix ups slow it s progress to expectable ending topped with some serious wtf surprise climax i just love the look on her face surprisingly laurenti manages to gather some suspense and air of malice in few very few scenes unluckily for him these few glimpses of mild movie magic go down quickly and effectively the plus sides are experienced when the gore hits the fan this department is quite effective and entertaining in that classic latex and red paint style of the s italo gore when things were made hand made and as shockingly and vivid as modest budgets could allow i could only watch with sadistic glee and few laughters all the over the top ways that obnoxious characters and actors got mangled and misused one by one i only felt sorry for linda blair who apparently haven t been let to try any other than that good old possessed girl woman role ever in his career or so it looks like when checking out his filmography well folks not much more to tell and even less to tell home about don t expect too much when spending some rainy afternoon with this and probably you ll experience at least some mild fun it also helps if your rotten little heart pounds in the beat of s euro gore horror and speaking of hearts every movie that has david hasselhoff getting skewered by a sizeable metal object and bleeding heavily around the room and corridors must have it s one on the right place this is my truth what is yours
this movie was just heckled by mst k and with good reason first and foremost because it is a cop movie starring joe don baker who we all know is about as good a cop actor as michael jackson is a country western singer all the typical cop movie plot devices rear their ugly heads bar fights children hostages in shoot outs bad acting lame police chiefs bad acting revenge justice endless goons and of course bad acting don t watch this without an mst k filter folks
s christian slater tara reid stephen dorff frank c turner mathew walker will sanderson directed by uwe boll based on the video game director uwe boll attempts to recreate the game into an action packed nail biter sadly he doesn t succeed instead he makes one of the worst movies ever made even though he gets minor celebrity such as christian slater tara reid and stephen dorff his movie lacks the necessary fundamentals that a movie needs to be good such as a story line and some basic relativity of what s going on in the dark and the light the movie bounces all around and uwe boll has no creative control and not to mention the bad cgi used on making the monsters even though they did look cool and the feedings were well a little lame honestly this is one of the worst movies ever made my final rating
camera work why is the camera work in this movie so jumpy this is annoying and distracting editing the flashes of the still pictures were way too short many of the other scenes were too short also just flashes sound the background music was way too loud and covered up the voices one should not have to rewind and replay to catch what was said doesn t anybody check these things and make them do it over again please reduce the volume of the background music in future is adjustment of the relative sound levels the job of the editor julia wong the plot had way too many loose ends the basic story line had potential i think the film needed more work was it rushed perhaps they ran out of money like a lot of movies it started out great but just petered out toward the end i really don t understand this you know you have the story board before it goes into production so why doesn t all the loose ends get taken care of in the storyboard sorry to be so critical
i should say right away that i checked the spoilers box only because i m giving this comment the amount of thought proportional to what this mess of a movie deserves and don t want to be held responsible for some plot point incidentally slipping out this comment will take the form of a tirade for the simple reason that i am still under the influence of this movie having just watched it and the unique effect this has renders one incapable of the sort of forethought and paragraph structure required for coherent reasoned criticism that is not a compliment it isn t the narcotic effect of a truly hypnotic or thought provoking movie the feelings it stirs up combine like some uncomfortable emotional voltron composed of a confusing mix of some form of rage the vague desire to take a shower the rudderless sinking feeling of true betrayal one gets when they realize they have given minutes of their lives into the hands of someone who would not only squander it but do so in such a pompous artless way and i probably wouldn t have done anything super productive with that minutes anyway but even if i d spent it on something trivial like a power block of masturbation and online poker i would have felt more fulfilled when all was said and done the problems with this movie are myriad and in better times i d articulate exactly what they were in a semi adult fashion but in keeping with what this movie deserves i think i ll most likely stick to the realm of masturbation jokes and cartoon references the most irritating and terminal flaw is that while watching this movie one is keenly aware that the makers and participants think they are making a much smarter movie than they are demonstrating the depth of knowledge one could pick up in a one semester survey of western art history at a community college or trade school the art jargon is piled on thick and from all directions with much of it supplied by talk between our hero the tortured detective stan willem dafoe who i will forgive for this movie due to him being willem dafoe and his accented antique dealer buddy blair peter stormare taking a break from playing a sociopath for whom murder comes easy by playing a dimensional plot device in a movie about a sociopath for whom murder comes easy and talk they do in fact we are dropped into this story at a crime scene that may indicate the reemergence of a serial killer stan thinks he killed years earlier so all the back story is established partially through unclear flashback but primarily through stilted conversations between stan and his dealer or stan and his colleague the unforgivably irritating carl scott speedman and although i differentiate the character carl scott speedman from the actor who plays him by using parentheses i must admit that very early on in the film i despised this character so much that i actually found myself sincerely wishing harm on the actor portraying him scott speedman not anything too fancy not death or paralysis necessarily but maybe herpes or maybe a stage light could fall on him and crush his arm this is a dangerous digression but i m not editing it out because i want to leave anyone reading this who s thinking about paying to see this train wreck of a movie with a clear impression of the horrible wishes and feelings it stirs in even the most peaceful man well i m sort of running out of steam here over the course of writing this the sick feelings this movie brought up in a me have subsided my head has cleared a bit realizing now that i m still investing time in something related to this piece of sh t is startlingly similar to waking up after a night of suicidally heavy drinking next to the heaving form of a still slumbering pound college girl your first urge is a desperate desire to flee this is natural
everyone involved and the audience should seek out the candidate to see how good this movie could have been what happened the south american story what were julie christie and kate capshaw thinking to allow their roles to be cardboard cut outs up to now i have liked every gene hackman performance and or movie he was either disinterested which i can hardly believe or dreadfully miscast i have also liked and defended richard gere and been vilified for it but here he had no power he was never intimidating and only occasionally persuasive all in all i was very disappointed i really expected much more from this director and cast if you can t find the candidate watch wag the dog again or even bulworth
this movie isn t very good it s boring and not much blood for a horror film the plot just trods along with not much happening and i think the female vampire was so stupid she had many chances to kill the vampire hunters since it shows her having lighting like reflexes but whenever she has one of them pinned she just takes her time and something always happens where she doesn t bite them no wonder this went straight to cable final verdict not anywhere near as good as the first vampire movie you re a sucker if you waste your time on this
basically there s a family where a little boy jake thinks there s a zombie in his closet his parents are fighting all the time this movie is slower than a soap opera and suddenly jake decides to become rambo and kill the zombie ok first of all when you re going to make a film you must decide if its a thriller or a drama as a drama the movie is watchable parents are divorcing arguing like in real life and then we have jake with his closet which totally ruins all the film i expected to see a boogeyman similar movie and instead i watched a drama with some meaningless thriller spots out of just for the well playing parents descent dialogs as for the shots with jake just ignore them
this movie is awesome i watched it the other day with my cousin jay jay he said it was alright but i think it rulezzz i mean it s so cool ted v mikels is so brave and smart he made a movie totally unlike those terrible hollywood films like the matrix and stop or my mom will shoot it could have been better though i like ninjas and pirates i also like that big talon that the funny man wears i think he s the coolest guy since that domino pizza claymation guy not only does this movie look really cool like those out of focus movies my dad made of my birthday when i turned but it tells a complex tale with dozens of characters that seem to be totally unrelated but they all meet up in the end it s genius how this web is woven to make everything meet up i wish ted v mikels would make a sequel but it needs more aliens and a pirate
i rented this film yesterday mostly due to the good looking art and the summary given on the back of the jacket after popping it into my dvd player i re examined the jacket cover and even though i took the cover out of from the plastic viewer i still could not read any of the production detail information about the film this film is entitled evil on the jacket and had to locate it by going to faith films website to find out any linkage to it here on imdb the filming and special affects done in the film looked quite good then a line reading actor spoke oh dear this actor s reading sounded like some pimple faced high school jock whose voice just managed to change pitch and no attempt given to go beyond reading the lines from the script at first i thought i got a bad disc out of audio sync then had to surmise it was a foreign film since i couldn t read the jacket english dialog dubbed if they d casted the right person for dubbing the dialog this film might have been decent i gave it a chance of about minutes before ejecting it when i discovered the bad line reader wasn t going to get killed off but stay as the constant main fixture yes it is that bad the jacket cover art and the art done in the film are great so gave the one star but minus stars for the rotten dialog i do not recommend this one
this is probably one of the worst movies i have ever seen everything about it is weak and incoherent the acting is absurd the costumes even crummier and the story is non existent this poverty row sword and adventure film was meant to capture some of the success that beastmaster and conan enjoyed but it doesn t give us any reason to follow along the lead character is tepid and dull he can t even fight with a sword and the sword is from the th century all the action sequences are like that slow and unrealistic not to mention the castle and the horribly dated music playing whenever they are riding a horse don t even bother with this crap
i rented this by mistake i thought after a cursory examination of the box that this was a time travel sci fi story instead it s a christian story and i suppose is fairly typical example if you are sold on the message you probably will overlook the awkwardness of the plot acting etc but i found it rather painful i have to admit that i m bothered by the rewriting of history in this story it paints the s as some sort of paradise of family values and morality a character is aghast that of marriages end in divorce but it overlooks very unsavory sides of this highly moral society rigid racial sexual and social discrimination were widespread for instance and at one point the hero complains to a clothing store owner about things that sound not all that different than the complaints of some iranian leaders about women s clothing styles as reported in a recent wsj overall thought i suppose that it s the sort of thing you ll like if you like this sort of thing and it s certainly wholesome
at least the seats in the theater were comfortable and i ate the pop corn as loud as possible to drown out the inferior dialogue this is absolutely not a girls film any blokes who like it are the ones us ladies can be sure to stay far away from dumb story mediocre dialogue and an overall cheap looking film i ve seen many many movies but this one is the new winner in the bad category if you do happen to see it the one thing you ll look forward to is the ending so you can finally run out of the theater as fast as you can
this is the most cliche ridden and worst romantic comedy i have ever seen every scene is cringe worthy and the two lead actors corey and danny are soo annoying corey is very dumb and naive and should have never listened to danny s false promises neve campbell and the killer from urban legend are the only redeeming qualities in this poor attempt of a film danny dean paras looks in his late thirties and the girl he s trying to bed corey looks as if she s still in college here in australia this film is called too smooth there is nothing smooth about this film at all avoid
this movie was horrible simply put it was so bad i registered with imdb to warn you of its dangers i am a campy horror film expert per se i have watched redneck zombies house of the psychotic women slumber party massacre ii and many others i know my schlock and i know this movie sucks three fourths of the film is comprised of scared individuals running from one side of the screen to the other when they are not running they are spouting non sequitur lines devoid of emotion or motivation when the actors begin to be acceptable the direction falls to pieces there were so many jarring low angle shots i figured leif jonker had a foot tall tripod he used what i call the leif maneuver several millions times that is zooming out from an object of interest like an amateur apparently the film crew couldn t get up early enough to film a sunrise so they filmed a sunset and played it in reverse with direction this lazy you are actually impressed with the final gory scene the only thing you can figure is that the last five minutes was filmed before the first eighty five minutes if you want a good bad gory movie rent riki oh or the foundational dead alive if you are a schlock buff and are looking for a challenge give darkness a go quote o the movie vampire it s die time
this is so incredibly bad poor actors you can tell they re trying really hard to polish a turd but we all know you can t the writing is so obvious and facile it s sad watching them try to sell it the humor and pacing are so labored it s hard to believe any of these good actors signed on for this that said it s so awful that we re having a hard time looking away from the screen we just have to know where this trainwreck goes but that s only because we caught it on tv if we had actually paid for this we d be disgusted so it gets stars for being at least amusingly fascinatingly bad and the incidental music as opposed to the trying too hard indie soundtrack is laughably reminiscent of an episode of scooby doo but not as good
my friends and i saw this film about a week ago and i feel it absolutely necessary to tell all the world or at least those who will read this that this movie is not only on the top five worst movies i have ever seen but actually has the honor of being the number one i have seen quite a lot of films but none beats this one in being stupid you could say i suffered watching it my only excuse is that we were waiting for a few hours and weren t able to go anywhere else without freezing our buttocks off i do not recommend this to anyone at first i thought we were watching some really bad porn movie but figured out after minutes that is not the case it is not a comedy it is not drama it is not action it is not horror it is just horrible
the screenwriter poorly attempted to re create the exorcist but put in some blah blah love story that makes you sick instead of keeping you engaged there is no substance whatsoever in this entire film it had the potential of being something special but blows it by showing a bunch of people yack about things nobody cares about extremely boring i wanted to leave the theater when i saw this but the dumb movie tickets were expensive so i had to withstand the dreary torture which felt like it lasted forever nothing on screen connected relevance back to whatever the characters were talking about they use computer graphics in here that instead of wowing me as it intended i hate cgi just ruined the movie even more some people say this movie did horrible in the movie theaters because of how thought provoking and slow paced without action because it s an intelligent film it was what is so intelligent or thought provoking when the story is basically about pretty boy heath ledger as a priest who has a love interest and disobeys his religion seems like an uninspired concept oh and there s some mumbo jumbo about the sin eater movie was originally going to be titled sin eater lame concept but the movie took the sin eater thing too seriously making the movie become pathetic and delusional about how dark and intelligent it was yeah i know there were really sin eaters in the medieval times but this movie just makes it sound cheesy nothing in the movie was executed right and i forget why i even bothered to see this movie if you want horror films that actually have depth watch rosemary s baby the tenant naked blood society cannibal holocaust pin exorcist omen or any of the romero dead trilogy films nonsense dialogue does not equate to intelligence people mainstream movie fans think that though same kind of people that think a ridiculous movie like hulk is a cinematic masterpiece if you want mind numbingly boring horror watch the order this movie makes church seem like a roller coaster ride
i really wanted to like this movie and watched all the way through thinking it had to get better don t get me wrong it s not the worst flick ever but it never lives up to it s potential the premise is good the cast is great i was especially pumped to witness the return of david naughton and god love em you can tell everyone tried their best it just falls short over and over again brutal massacre should serve as a constant reminder to filmmakers that only christopher guest can do christopher guest movies and despite the fact he makes it look easy you should probably just forget trying to do the same naughton and brian o halloran are fantastic in this and they should be seen more often they are the reason this gets stars from me if you re going to have the spinal tap of horror i suspect you might want the guy who made spinal tap to helm it just thinking out loud there
this was a truly insipid film the performances are third rate and the dialogue is so stilted that at times it seemed to have just rolled over and died my reason for renting this was simple find a movie with scriptwriting i needed a visual aid for my presentation so i figured why not use a clip boy was i wrong after searching my local video store i came upon this where it was suspiciously titled starstruck i thought what the hey and decided to give it a try well i was very unhappy with my results there was maybe one scene i could use and meanwhile i was practically falling asleep because of the sheer banality of the flick so i took this back and picked up ed wood there s a movie i can use as an example then again anything would be presentable compared to the drivel that is starfucker
within minutes my whole family was rooting for goldie hawn s character to die or at least for steve martin s character to leave her at minutes we turned it off there are only a couple of movies a year we try that turn out so annoying that we can t even stomach it long enough for the story to get established normally i like both steve martin and goldie hawn and i remember enjoying the neil simon original so i blame marc lawrence and sam weisman combine the director of whats the worst that can happen and the writer of miss congeniality and i guess this is what we end up with
john carpenter s career is over if this sad excuse for a movie is any indication his excuse is that he only produced it jon bon jovi looks like a girl in fact bon jovi and the two vampire girls natasha wagner and arly jover probably all fit in the same clothes in short it was hard to tell which one was cuter in an anorexic ramp model sort of way bon jovi has the most charisma at least he looks happy when he is smiling the two vampire girls on the other hand are all cramps and complaints at one point they are about to give each other a wet kiss but stop amazing how each vampire movie has some set of morays for the respective vampires at one point arly jover is providing fellatio to a very dumb vampire hunter and then she sucks his blood while doing the sex act it would have been an erotic moment except that it was filmed like a total goof and the male actor looked mildly amused as he watched arly jover move her head to mimic something that was very obviously not happening as far as gore is concerned a few heads are ripped off and the blood spurts profusely these scenes have so little suspense or build up that when they happen it is almost funny and there is no horror pay off from the scene all you get as a member of the audience is a feeling of wow that sure was a lot of red paint splattering on the walls i wonder who has to clean it up throughout the movie these vampire hunters who are obviously trying to kill arly jover the top vampire in the world keep reaching out to her at one point bon jovi goes into the abandoned church and after he just shot her with an arrow and has done so on other occasions he says i am not trying to hurt you i just want to talk to you i want to get to know you huh of course the dumb vampire arly jumps out to say hello and bon jovi sticks her again with another impaling device why can t we be friends the s hit song by war should have been the theme song for this movie aside from all of the other silly moments there is a transfusion sequence when natasha wagner has all her vampire blood removed and the town people all line up to donate blood for her transfusion i guess blood type is not important anyhow all her vampire blood is removed bon jovi then decides that if that blood is transfused into him he can beat arly by becoming a vampire also of course as the vampire blood is transfused into him none of his healthy blood is removed so apparently bon jovi is walking around with twice as much blood as any human can have in his body and just like the first vampires this one also has the vampires bursting into flames special effect
a friend of mine lent this video to me and i was fairly excited to watch it but after ten minutes of james hetfield s slow pitched vocals and lars banging on his drum set in what appeared to be slow motion i began to think why am i watching this that question will be coursing through your minds in minutes after you hit play i gave the tape back the same day as you would suspect not worth buying or watching just my opinion
what the hell is this its one of the dumbest movies i ve seen i don t understand why people on this site love it so much its senseless nudity for no reason its worst then resident evil i strongly don t recomend it unless you want to watch chessy bad acting crap watch real horor movies such as stephen king s it the shining jurassic park kinda horor jaws etc leave this crap for a rental when there is nothing else to rent it is bad as crudy vs gayson attack of the killer tomatoes is better then this crap oh wow flesh eating zombies how many damn zobie movies do we need skip this one outta
wanda nevada is a pubescent fantasy movie using circa ideas of what constitutes illicit romance for year old girls script pacing and direction are uniformly awful action sequences defy belief characters speak with the simplified diction one usually finds in films aimed at the under set but also includes multiple sexual references involving shields character as well as graphic deaths the movie wants to be a comedy on some level but is never funny an adventure picture but plot and action are insipid and a children s movie but introduces pedophilia and child rape as real possibilities it also wants to be a buddy picture a coming of age picture a ghost movie an indian spiritual movie a travelogue and a western the overall affect is of massive stupidity with a nasty twist wanda nevada is a complete waste of time unless you want to see a good many terrific shots of the grand canyon that it manages to do just fine
gave us the very decent gore porn flick hostel and gave us live feed a not so decent rip off of hostel live feed follows pretty much the same formula as eli roth s earlier film except this time the dumb kids are in asia rather than central europe the plot focuses on these dumb kids and one of them has annoyed one of the locals so they find themselves in trouble the locals decide to lock them all in a theatre and kill them despite the fact that i d heard some less than favourable things about this film before seeing it i still hoped that it might be at least half decent because director ryan nicholson previously made the very decent minute rape and revenge film torched but this film falls down simply because most of it is either ridiculous or boring the film is obviously trying to hark back to the good old days of grindhouse cinema which hostel did successfully but it really doesn t come off surprisingly considering nicholson s previous work in special effects not even the gore is impressive although it is a lot better than the acting there s not much else i can say about this film it s bad and not in a good way avoid it
i was excited when i heard they were finally making this horrific event into a movie the whole era s southern california and subject matter drug and porn industry is intriguing to me i thought this would be a sure fire hit i was not thrilled with the choice of kilmer as holmes they do not resemble each other in physical appearance or mannerisms i guess he sells tickets however i was willing to overlook this and give it a fair shot i was a bit shocked that there were only like four other people in the entire theater with me on that first day of showing now the whole crime and story in the film is hard to do i will admit that there were no witnesses to this very violent and brutal act john holmes was there but he was also a pathological liar and worried about what would happen to his family and self if he talked to police about it in fact holmes never really testified about what happened and the crime did go unsolved so this was still really one big mystery a mystery that this movie does nothing to cast light on the person writing the screenplay had a whole lot of discretion and most of the principal characters are dead however there is no real storyline it is fragmented claptrap the script is light and the actors try to hard to beef up paper thin lines by overacting the film gives no insight into holmes or the other people involved kilmer s character disappears for long stretches his girlfriend is dull the police are jokes even kudrow tries hard to make a flimsy role look substantial it is a very shallow piece and dare i say boring the director even tries to turn it into a love story which is nice unless you know anything about what a piece of trash john holmes really was perhaps a couple of viewings of anderson s boogie nights might have helped here boogie nights was innovative and exciting in all regards this film on the other hand was flat and without any real charm or style even the music is out of place with duran duran being played in a scene that was supposed to have taken place in then we have gordon lightfoot gordon lightfoot there could have been a great film based on this gruesome event but i have not seen it yet i have not seen even a decent one yet unless you consider the rahad jackson scene from boogie nights
with a title like that it s above and beyond my comprehension how this movie just did not appeal to me granted there s a few decently sleazy moments and a little gore but the way in which the movie was shot and the overall storyline just struck me as an idiotic and lazy attempt at profuse shock tactics the inconsistent plot starts with a guy raping and murdering a woman stranded at the side of the road he and his abetting brother are imprisoned up until the brother breaks out and arranges to meet his girlfriend out in the woods he ends up forcing her into a house where they screw and he later shows her a collection of kidnapped guys in the basement the heavily drugged captives consist of her old boyfriend who raped her a grabby neighbor and her sexually abrasive boss he explains to her that he is going to kill them all she winds up killing him and then turning her focus towards the men or pigs whom she tortures and kills herself most of the violence and humiliation has to do with sh t eating and genitalia destroying all of which are far from disturbing and essentially mild the best scene is a graphic broom handle masturbation followed by some painful man rape surely i spit on your corpse i p ss on your grave was intended as an unofficial sequel to i spit on your grave based on mainly the title and a reference the main character gives suggesting her mother was camille keaton i personally consider that to be a wildly blasphemous assertion this movie is a boring amateurish mess that strives for shocks but failed miserably
this flick reminds me some really bad science fiction movies from s and s it is not scary or interesting but it s dull cheesy and stupid special effects are laughable all actors are ludicrous and the ending is simply awful don t waste your money rent or buy something better i give it out of i found this turkey quite amusing because of its stupidity
the first few minutes of the bodyguard do have a campy charm it opens with crawling text from the bible the part that samuel jackson recites to his soon to be victims in pulp fiction continues with two karate school teachers in new york arguing about the eternal question of mankind who is better sonny chiba or bruce lee and then chiba appears playing himself he immediately stops a plane hijacking and breaks a bottle in two with his bare hand unfortunately any entertainment value intentional or unintentional soon gets crushed by the disjointed story the lack of action for long periods of time and the poor quality of any present action to keep it simple here s why the bodyguard is an unbearable movie to watch you don t know what s going on there are barely any fights the fights that are there are short and terribly filmed sonny chiba is cool judy lee is gorgeous her face is glorious it s only for them that i give the bodyguard a nd star out of this movie makes minutes feel like hours
fragmentaric movie about a couple of people in austria during a heatwave this kind of movie has been done more often and most of all better the stories don t really have anything to do with each other apart from the pathetic finale people are cruel ugly flesh unpleasant people and a movie that goes on way too long without really making a point ultra realistic hardly boring indeed not even gorgeous franzisca weiss can save this one
it had all the clich s of movies of this type and no substance the plot went nowhere and at the end of the movie i felt like a sucker for watching it the production was good however the script and acting were b movie quality the casting was poor because there were good actors mixed in with crumby actors the good actors didn t hold their own nor did they lift up the others this movie is not worthy of more words but i will say more to meet the minimum requirement of ten lines james wood and cuba gooding jr play caricatures of themselves in other movies if you are looking for mindless entertainment i still wouldn t recommend this movie
i have no clue as to what this was shot on but you can definitely tell that they had no budget bad acting horrible cinematography and lame plot and some decent special effects do not make a good movie the wwf style cinemtography will make you cry where s the tripod the filmakers aimed high but sorely missed their mark
i see where a few people involved in this debacle wrote reviews to share their side of the story and i thought what they wrote was helpful in understanding it the fact that they basically came up with excuses rewrites budget constraints production formats etc simply underlines how bad this movie is and my criticisms in panning it are not personally directed but simply a warning that this one doesn t make the cut it s watchable but barely so there are plot holes in every corner the dialogue borders on the ridiculous and the ending is telegraphed a mile away the modestly interesting feature of a hologram interacting with a recon team get drowned in silly dialogue like who makes a meal in the midst of what is supposed to be a tense and deadly encounter with an unknown enemy would ya wrassle us up some hamburger helper sally between us getting killed by these automated carpet sweepers apparently this elite team equipped with the latest gizmos and red plastic tubed wonder armor has no access to mres once they get into the last rooms they treat the place more like a four star motel than a deadly encounter zone the rationale for the encounter with the fearsome rook is that it can t be killed single handedly yet only one scene ago the hero making that case abandoned king to do exactly that huh vivian woo was attractive and hands down the best acted character in the movie but that s not saying much
think of a no budget version of china syndrome being directed by a film student who idolizes john woo and you ll get power play the idea was good but the execution acting and dialog absolutely killed it not to mention ridiculous amounts of violence and disaster sequences that was used to compensate for lack of substance and development of the more interesting parts of the movie this is the story of a reporter investigating the disappearance of three members of a guerrilla activist group who mysteriously went missing after they broke into the offices of a power plant that is suspected to be causing a frenzy of earthquake the rather cavalier reporter going up against what should ve been a more ruthless bunch of company execs is chased around town along with anyone he speaks to in order to clean whatever conclusive evidence might remain of the plant s faults unfortunately there is no real sense of emergency because the characters interact with much hesitancy coupled with idiotic dialog and a lot of horrible acting not to mention the viewer who may only be attracted to the movie for it s action genre appeal is forced to endure a mounting body count and ridiculous amounts of violent shoot em ups plus earthquake disaster scenes all of the focus was put in the wrong place to apologetically compensate for the lack of direction and more interesting sequence of events that should ve propelled the story it might ve been much better had the filmmakers focused more on a thriller and paid greater attention to developing the corruption aspects of this story creepy villains a naive reporter and those who attempt to alert the reporter of the wrong doing afoot it is formulaic but at least it would ve been entertaining
man oh man what a piece of crummy film making but this is a guilty pleasure from my childhood even though i hate to admit it they showed this movie on my basic cable system all the time where i grew up in san jose california right on the border of cupertino we had this thing called the g channel on our cable system and they basically showed the same one movie over and over and over again wanda nevada was one of those movies i fell in lust and love with the young brooke shields and loved her dopey adventures in the grand canyon in the s the script makes almost no sense the direction is poor the few highlights are that henry fonda makes an appearance a lot of dialog that s so bad it s good and a nice carole king song played over the end credits maybe you have to be stoned to truly enjoy this flick and hey everybody knows there ain t no gold in the grand canyon
don t listen to the misleading title werewolf woman the europeans are well known for putting an emphasis on sex and nudity over actual scares in their horror films but this one here is just a bit too much werewolf woman seems to have a sleazy sex scene copped off with the title character going crazy and brutally killing her partner fun the first few times but a hundred minutes of this becomes very monotonous quickly shes not even a werewolf but a schizo chick whose ancestor was hanged for lycanthropy the film can t even decide its tone with the first ten minutes a flashback being legitimate supernatural horror i thought i was in for a trash classic after these to a rather poor character study of the female being repeatedly abused and tortured to a revenge thriller at the end the director insists this is based on a true story yeah all right to be fair there are a few entertaining aspects of the production the title werewolf woman is a looker and there are a few nice gore effects and nude scenes however these become rather monotonous quickly also the dubbed dialog is pretty hilarious in a camp fashion especially the worlds most swinging doctor he drinks on the job unfortunately the film becomes pretty irritating fast there s no actual plot or anything else really its a shame because reading a description i felt the film had some real potential werewolf woman is far overlong slow moving and a bit too pointless even by the standards of the exploitation genre
i went into this film expecting it to be similar to the matrix or pi boy was i wrong yes there is a poorly written poorly acted plot in the movie with cg animated cells and peptides to boot however the real focus of the film are the expert talking heads spewing out new age feel good hogwash in between plot segments sure it stars off innocently enough there is a little bit of real quantum physics in the beginning it states for example that electrons exist as both particle and wave and that an atom is mostly empty space however the movie takes a giant and unscientific leap saying that sub atomic quantum effects happen on large scales as well the talking heads take it even further according to them the following are true when columbus arrived in the caribbean the natives were unable to see his ships because their minds were incapable of perceiving something so different meditation can reduce the murder rate with positive thought you can walk on water your thoughts can change the formations of ice crystals in bottles of water and hey that s only in the first minutes watching the movie was torture this film felt like a movie they would show you to get you to join a cult after doing my homework i realized that it basically is just that on the other hand this could be seen as a campy comedy albeit one that s not funny save your time and money don t see this movie
way back when i was renting videos for free i picked this one up oops the things i wanted to mention outside the summary already given were these someone who had a lot to do with making this movie had a strange and sick fascination for food it was gross and unecessary there is some kind of a soundtrack in the background of the film that seems to be there the entire time and by the way i felt for days after viewing this trash i figure they had something subliminal going on in the track either that or it was just traumatisingly bad or both many times throughout the movie you can tell the writer and director did not have much experience or talent and don t even ask about the acting
two years ago on berlin film festival we watched the amos kollek movie sue in the panorama program with a wonderful anna thomson in the leading part it s a film about loneliness and sex and how the one thing is compensated by the other in the same section on the festival now we have to complain the superfluous antithesis of sue extension du domaine de la lutte which now tries to convince us that loneliness and having no sex is one and the same problem but unfortunately we can t sympathize with our hero how he is called by the story teller because he is unnecessarily and incomprehensibly tired of company and himself own fault i m sorry i can t understand him not enough the writer director actor want us admitting to him that it s not his destroyed self consciousness or the passivity of his personality what brought him so far but the rotten society and its image of sexuality yes there are some deeper insights about gender relations but we won t follow him so far and the point is that there is rather any sign of reflection about his own portion to the fate having no sex who didn t notice yet it s a quite depressing film in the beginning there had been some starts to be more accurate in sketching the situation at the bed store the hero speaks about the hindrances buying a new bed perhaps it s too broad getting up the stairs you have to stay at home half a day this is a satire about a character who doesn t know taking the life and heart in hands doing something the movie doesn t follow this path but handles his characters with helplessness nobody believes that our hero is able to instigate tisserand for a murder too dull too kind too passive not to mention tisserand s complex he has an inhibition but he couldn t be of course a murderer of women to finish there are women and the world it s not a device of a modern sexualized society help you as you can but don t follow the messages and the wisdom of this movie which announces bankruptcy to human relationships without seizing the real conflicts within
i have begun to melt so i will make this review as short and sweet as possible there s this astronaut and he goes up in a spacecraft with two other guys ya know except something happens that exposes him to radiation and then when they come back well never mind what happened to the other guys but our astronaut has begun to melt no not just burn up but melt like an ice cream cone in july well ok maybe not that fast but ya know what i mean anyway he gets all red gooey and the fact that he s melting makes him really mad i guess he also checked out the melting man handbook because suddenly he knows that in order to keep from totally melting away he has to eat human flesh so he starts ripping people apart there are other characters but in a movie where a man melts and melts and melts and melts do you really need any others what s important is who will he munch next and what will be left of them how long will it take for him to just melt away to nothing why was this movie made in the first place where did they get the money when will you fall asleep while watching it i ve very nearly melted but i still have enough time left to tell you that this movie is dreadfully boring even though the idea is really cool and kind of gross the makeup is neat but everything else is splat
i ve always been enthusiastic about period dramas an art form in which the bbc has excelled in the past this presentation of byron was unbelievable unbelievably bad the script was dreadful the acting uninspired and all the characters woefully insipid apparently byron was mad bad and dangerous to know and set the ladies hearts all a flutter not in this production here he appeared as a tawdry jumped up little squirt instead of a fiery hero of womenfolk and the greek struggle for independence it is said that byron walked with a limp this portrayal of the man was just limp all over i watched the whole two and a half hours waiting for something to spark into life not a splutter not even a glimmer it was utter tedium if not downright boredom from start to finish having the opinion that no one will ever better the bard of avon i also believe that byron s poetry is over revered and to my mind should be flung on the back burner and this dramatisation of his life should be accorded the same treatment i think the bbc lost its nous with this one
this film like the first one the man from snowy river has the same good and bad features perhaps even more so than the original unfortunately the bad outweighs the good the good magnificent scenery better than the first film i love those high country shots in australia tom burlinson is still a likable guy as jim craig bruce rowland did a nice job with the music too the bad once again we get an extremely obnoxious feminist heroine jessica sigrid thornton who is a world class pouter with an extremely annoying face and manner about her in this film we also get a big downgrade in who pays the father previously it was kirk douglas now replaced by the always profane brian dennehy speaking of that it is a disgrace that a walt disney film would includes usages of the lord s name in vain that was one reason was almost totally down the tubes in the s this film like the first one
maybe you shouldn t compare but wild style and style wars are original hip hop beat street does have a lot of the original artists of early hip hop but they ve been obviously made clear that this could be their big break of course for some it was and that s nice but if you view this as original hip hop culture you re wrong it s overproduced and has a hollywood sauce rather look for the first two movies i mentioned they have convey the grittiness that comes with life in the ghetto yes the rating for this movie is low but the reviews are mostly positive or even raving this is probably because although the story the acting the dialogues and the direction all are dreadful the music and dancing is what the people love about it me i do love the dancing but at the time thought that electro was the death of hip hop i was so glad when round a new generation of now classic hip hop artists appeared like krs one public enemy ultramagnetic mc s jungle brothers bizmarkie to name a few and i still don t like most of the beats in this movie and that is why it doesn t work for me i mean wild style has not much of a story but the music there is great and authentic of course tastes differ and that s alright but as far as i m concerned this movie is trash except for the break dancing and some of the music and so i can t rate it higher than a out of ten
seriously what the hell was this movie about simply stupid i d give it but awful is the lowest you can go seriously this movie is not worth watching waste of time i don t know what the hell is wrong with you guys voting this movie out of i seriously can make a better movie than this hire some other unemployed people n i promise i ll make a movie better than this this movie was so bad that i ll never watch a movie starring steve carrel again bottom line don t waste your time to download it off the net or rent it i d nominate this movie for the worst movie of the century i mean the worst is something gotta give but after that this is the second
i hated this movie so much i remember it vividly it is not even funny any movie that relies on unfunny sex jokes and racism humor does not deserve the money it costs to make it in the first half hour rob schneider drinks a carton of rancid milk all i could think was he deserves it for making such a bad movie don t waste your time or money on this one
horrible horrible horrible do not waste your money to rent this movie its like a low budget made for tv canadian movie absolutely the worst movie i have ever seen and there have been many others out there this movie is not worth the time it takes to put it in the dvd player or vcr is it possible to write ten lines the acting was horrific it had absolutely no flow i saw the made for tv movie on the btk killer and it was much better in comparison to this one i am not sure what they were going for in producing this film but if it was to educate us or tell a story about the btk killer they missed by a mile it appeared to be more of a infomercial for animal rights
this is a great idea for a film but it unfortunately doesn t turn out to be a great movie what starts out as a sweet and almost goofy romantic comedy about a fluffer in love with his fluffee spirals out of control into a bizarre combination of genres and a veritable stew of plots with liberal borrowings from boogie nights thelma and louise showgirls frisk and even a curious dash of blows thrown in towards the end at least the director did his research the result is not necessarily boring but in the end this slick well produced flick doesn t quite add up to anything however the actors all do a game job with the material and there are a few good laughs at the behind the scenes world of gay porn
i d been following this films progress for quite some time so perhaps expected a little too much i consider both gillian anderson and danny dyer to be good at what they do and was interested to see what dan reed could come up with but unfortunately it just didn t work for me the problem lies in the fact that the film doesn t really seem to understand which genre it s falling into and as such it fails to impress on drama horror and thriller elements because rather than focusing on one of them and doing it well it s a bit of a jack of all trades and master of none the premise as with most revenge films is simple couple meet and go out something bad happens and they get their revenge it s a simple formula and one that many directors have handled expertly over the years unfotunately in this case it s as if dan reed thought it d be great to do one of those revenge films that goes a little deeper by showing a more human side to all the characters and delving into their mental state in more detail wrong there are also a few key elements missing in this type of movie there s generally some kind of warning a don t do this or this might happen element which adds to the tension but there s nothing of the sort here it just simply happens then nothing happens for an hour then something interesting happens and then it ends there s a lot of really stiff competition in this genre and hats of to dan reed for trying i have no issue with his directing abilities but in term of writing i d say next time he should stick to the formula for the type of film he s making instead of trying to be too clever and he ll have a quality movie on his hands
ok people honestly this gotta be one of the worst movies about show biz that s ever been made but i ve been laughing myself silly which may be why i enjoyed it basically it s all about sex sex and a way to get your own personal minutes of fame did i mention that sex was a major issue in this movie if you have a thing going for bizzzzare characters and easy entertainment watch this movie when you get the chance and don t have something better to do attention spoilers the funniest thing on the movie was the guy who asked jerry whether he could marry his goat on the show and flashing his wallet with his love s pictures a triple a for bad taste and fun
what ever possessed martin scorcese to remake this film and not only did he remake it completely ruin it the nonsensical decision to make the character played by robert deniro in his most overdone performance and that s saying a lot into a religious fanatic is ridiculous and exemplary of attitudes harbored by hollywood and mr scorcese especially attitudes that compel writers to think that the best way to make a character insane is to tattoo a crucifix on his back in any case this movie is awful
nicolas roeg he directed the classic supernatural thriller don t look now didn t he strangely the aforementioned movie was broadcast on bbc television at the weekend which did tonight s screening of cold heaven no favours what so ever you see it s impossible not to compare cold heaven with don t look now since they both have the same director and the same structure and for the first third of cold heaven i thought they also had the same plot except a dead husband had been substituted instead of a dead child in fact my mind was set on this movie revolving around a grief stricken widow seeing her late husband running around venice wearing a red anorak this doesn t occur but about one third of the way through the running time there s a massive plot twist and despite being an essential plot twist it s not explained in any great depth in fact very little is explained in cold heaven which ruins the movie people have mentioned the rather poor production values of cold heaven and it s impossible not to notice them if i didn t no different i would have thought this was a tvm since it s got a made for television feel to it right down to white capital letters in the title sequence roeg also tries to inject art house pretentions via spoken thought processes but again this doesn t help the movie at all one can t help feeling roeg should have put all his effort into the plot twists which are totally flat on screen cheap production values disinterested directing and a really bizarre premise and screenplay make for a bad movie
my god what an incredible movie it is reminded me so much of the similar scene in mel gibson s movie we were soldiers when the company is not lost they re just cut off and the other scene in pearl harbour when the british officer says to ben affleck if all americans are like you then god help the nation that goes to war with america put all movies together and you would have enough bullshit to fertilise the entire sahara desert the story of the cut off battalion may be real enough but the movie could have done without all that american preachy jingoistic propaganda attached to it there were audible groans in the cinema during the above mentioned scene in pearl harbour no kidding either the lost battalion however is really in a class of its own americans think they are unbeatable inspired bravery i actually cringed and damn near puked at all the swill being spewed out throughout this diarrhoeic disaster the movie that is the fighting scenes were well made stars for that but if the script is manure then wrapped even in brightly coloured ribbons it is still manure the writer james carabatsos also wrote those other screamers hamburger hill no mercy heartbreak ridge someone please shoot him before he writes any more such garbage the director russell mulcahy is an australian too god the shame
as far as heist movies go this one is pretty weak continuity is pretty lousy there isn t enough character continuity to really feel like you understand any of the characters peter falk is great and he is one of the reasons its worth watching falk has some great lines like he ll be right back he goin buy to some saugages or something like that there are a few nice scenes although they are entirely due to the efforts of the actors direction script and editing is pretty lousy
this film for an after school special isn t that bad and that s the problem nothing happens you feel as if you re still in class a guy teaches a bunch of young underdogs how to be good paint ball players we never get to see these underdogs doing badly as the good player is training them they all of the sudden turn into good players by meditating also there are too many characters and no character development too much time is spend on the main character and his sexy sister and not enough on some of the other kids this could have had a bad news bears feel the original since there was a girl on an all boys team but there wasn t any feel to this movie at all it has no feeling and leaves a dull pain in your bones after watching it is not fun to bag on not fun to watch and is just kind of there plain boring something you d watch after school before your pre evening nap as dull as the day is long and it s been a long long day watching this movie
this is the page for house of exorcism but most people have confused this film with the mario bava masterpiece lisa the devil which explains the ridiculously high rating for this house of exorcism when lisa the devil was shown at film festivals in the early s it was a critical success audiences responded well to that gorgeous gothic horror film unfortunately it was a bit ahead of it s time and was considered too unusual and not commercial enough for mass consumption no distributor would buy it so producer alfredo leone decided to edit lisa seemingly with a chainsaw by removing just about half of the original film and adding new scenes which he filmed two years after the original product it is important to note that bava had little to do with these new hideous additions so technically house of exorcism is not a bava film the original product is a slow dreamy classy production a few minutes into the film the viewer is jarred out of this dream world as suddenly we see lisa two years older and with a very different haircut begin to writhe on the ground making guttural sounds and croaking epitaphs like suck my co k etc subtle huh and the film continues like this jumping back and forth between a beautiful visual film and a grade z exorcist rip off leone was trying to incorporate these shock scenes while keeping some semblance of a story intact he failed miserably when the choice was made to basically destroy lisa and the devil bava himself refused saying that his film was too beautiful to cut he was right and it must have been quite sad for this artist to see all his work destroyed and flushed down the toilet it was many years before the original lisa and the devil was seen again re surfacing on late night television i had seen lisa long before i saw this new version and it was downright disturbing to witness one of my favorite films vandalised in this way worth seeing only for curiosity sake otherwise avoid this insidious disaster like the plague
once i ignored some of the implausibilities this was actually a fairly decent horror monster flick so i ll give some of the good points first the dragon was quite convincing especially as she prowled through the tunnels looking for lunch hint she likes humans the action was fairly non stop and after a weak beginning i got quite absorbed in the storyline sorry to say i was kind of rooting for the dragon she was probably the most convincing and consistent character in the movie now for the implausible stuff maybe some spoilers if you were hunting a fire breathing dragon in ad would you charge into its cave with a barrel of gunpowder under your arm duh a female character with an all american name blonde hair and obvious slavic accent trying to pretend she s spanish huh a lead scientist whose slavic accent you can cut with a knife and he s supposedly born in chicago educated in usa a military helicopter pilot who does his own repairs flies a huge transport copter with no other crew and is an expert marksman and combat soldier to boot ok uh huh i won t even mention his giving different call signs in minutes while communicating with his base it s still better than some of the japanese monster flicks from the s but not by much if we re lucky we won t see dragon fighter though naturally the ending left that possibility wide open or maybe they ll hire a real director next time in spite of everything i gave this flick a out of add more if they rewrite the plot and dean cain gets eaten in the first ten minutes
after finally viewing this movie in its entirety i am completely mystified by the adoration it has received by critics and online users alike is it the worst western ever no i wouldn t say that but the last great american western a phrase i saw applied to it more than once not even close a movie that tries to tell a story like this needs believable characters that speak believable dialogue and the dialogue in this film is among the most hackneyed and clich d that i ve ever seen the movie can be measured in groaners per minute as in how many times is an actor or actress forced by the script to say something that no human being would say in real life there s so many instances of this that it s distracting cheesy lines come at you in waves predictable unoriginal and often if bad dialogue doesn t bother you then how about bad gunfights few westerns can show you gunfighting that s completely unbelievable while desperately trying to make you take the action seriously it s okay if there s a comic edge to such gunfighting such as in silverado but in tombstone the very staged and very stiff choreography of the early gunplay is just another reason to leave this movie off the list of good westerns the final showdown somewhat redeems the director on this score but by then i was so disinterested in the movie that it was beyond saving other than those flaws i can say the visuals are stunning the movie s well shot and the settings all look great the acting is passable especially considering what the actors were given to work with however if you re looking for the last great american western do yourself a favor go rent unforgiven instead out of
the lovely eva longoria parker plays kate who dies after an ice angel crushes her before the i do s with fianc henry paul rudd after two years henry has yet to move on and his sister chloe lindsay sloane is very concerned chloe arranges for henry to talk with an attractive psychic ashley lake bell ashley is to contact kate s spirit hoping to help henry get on with his life when the psychic starts getting attracted to henry kate s ghost appears to nip the romance in the bud there are some funny situations but if you ve seen the trailers you have seen the substance of the film also in the cast stephen root jason biggs william morgan sheppard and wendi mclendon covey i personally thought that bell stole the show from parker and biggs as usual a pain in the butt still this movie was over hyped
i never wanted to see this film then one day for a joke i watched it to see how bad it was my preconceptions were confirmed for starters i d like to question the politics of the film it hides behind of mask of women making it big in the city but the only way that women can make it big is through using their sexuality rather than their intelligence or skills these women are nothing more the whores are slightly less attractive girls not allowed to be successful this is not the only right wing message of the film there are hundreds of shots of american flags and huge wads of cash a fine example of how the only powerful thing in america is capitalism and anything of spiritual moral or artistic value is not even given a look in of this film money is depicted as the only important thing to young people the manageress of the bar states that she does not allow drug users in her bar and then she goes on to poor gallons of hard liquor down her own neck and then the necks of her staff and customers any one who knows anything about intoxicants will know that liquor can be just as dangerous as heroin and more dangerous than most illegal drugs and finally why are scenes in which the lead character is a point of sexual interest to the audience when she is getting undressed or with her boyfriend is her father always involved we watch get her undressed with the camera virtually caressing her legs while she is one the phone to her father she auctions her father just as she auctions her boyfriend i find this most strange in conclusion this film is immoral fascistic degrading to women and frankly disturbing but what else do you expect from jerry bruckhiemer
rather than move linearly from beginning to end this story line of a gay couple impacted by aids orbits in time around their perfect day the film is organized as a life remembered in asynchronous fragments rather than in a sequential flow as one directly experienced the narration has its lyrical moments particularly in describing the impact of loss anticipated or experienced the dialog unfortunately lacks such grace the script frequently compels the actors to say startlingly stupid or insensitive things that seem utterly out of character at the moment on their second accidental encounter clearly smitten with each other sensitive phillip encourages a reluctant guy to tell him about his difficult week but the moment guy begins to open up phillip an english major blurts out you re not a crisis fairy are you later watching his lover s naked chiseled body stride across the bedroom toward him our young shakespeare in love begins to render the beauty of the moment in words the way you cut through space i can t even describe it but lacks the verbal skills to complete his thought this kind of drivel continues through the aids hospice scenes bejeweled with lines like what made me think death would be all neat and tied up with ribbons and you make florence nightingale look like nurse ratchet the film often suffers from a bruising lack of subtlety unlikable characters are far more jarring and steamroller flattened than they need to be phillip s thoroughly annoying friends an arrogant trust fund brat and a whining needy dweeb maintain a running caustic diatribe about every one crossing their path such patter could offer a writer a wealth of opportunities for clever social commentary but sadly their remarks are merely unpleasant ungraced by wit or insight it s hard to know if our scriptwriter intentionally crafted intellectually limited characters or if he was simply running his tether s perimeter the plot may be what most appeals to and resonates with those who praise this film it does seriously explore s us middle class gay life first encounters courting coupling nesting the complexity of open relationships friction and fracturing dissolution physical abuse rapprochement forgiveness terminal illness death and survival leads phelan and spirtas give fair to good performances rendering complex characters over time their fetching good looks help explain both the chemistry that held these two together through insensitivity and selfishness as well as the chemistry that helped some some viewers overlook this film s painful weaknesses the decision to chop the plot arc into tidbits and present them in out of sequence flashbacks added complexity without any evident dramatic utility and in several cases left the sequence and thus the implications of a given event unclear could i recommend the film to sticklers for literary and technical quality absolutely not for easy going viewers in serious need of an aids survivor catharsis or in the mood for a guilty pleasure tearjerker with a little eye candy thrown in maybe but better written alternatives exploring the impact of aids on relationships of that era include philadelphia and the band played on longtime companion angels in america an early frost parting glances love valour compassion and even jeffrey
a previous reviewer said the movie is not all that bad what the movie glorifies child molestation oh but sylvia kristel was naked in it so let s give it out of stars why not a full because the filmography was agonizing the child s looks of shock were unrealistic and the fat friend was irritating nowhere in the review does the reviewer express any outrage that an american movie in featured scenes of a child having sex with a grown woman i happened to catch this steaming loaf of a movie while staying at a hotel that had showtime to me even if the fat friend had acted up a storm and was a deserving of an oscar i would still have to give the movie only star that tv s howard hessman starred in the movie at the same time as he was appearing in wkrp is particularly ridiculous but don t take my word for it
aaron spelling produced this made for television western that gets awfully plotty for a seventy three minute film it plays like a probable failed series pilot handsome clint walker is u s marshal dave harmon who wanders into yuma arizona territory in time to kill one of the brothers of the local bigwig rancher who is out on a trail drive walker takes the other brother to jail walker also meets a cute homeless mexican kid who sleeps at the jailhouse one night andres is snoozing when a villain and another man dressed in army blue take the remaining brother into the street and kill him pinning the murder on walker not good for your first twenty four hours on the job walker visits the local army fort and rankles the chains of the commander the bigwig hears of his brothers deaths and rides back to town in time to get his chains rankled as well the local native population who get short changed by the army on their beef also get rankled in the chains area with all these chains getting rankled walker still has time to woo the local hotel owner the army guy involved in the murder ends up dead the local cattle buyer is implicated the indians do a lot of hesitant speechifying and the climax brings about an unlikely showdown as walker must prove to the town that the villainous cattle buyer had a boss someone we have suspected as being too helpful all along there is a semi subplot involving the death of walker s family at the hands of army raiders and i think this would have been the force behind the series had it been picked up instead the film ends abruptly and i kept waiting for scenes from next week s exciting episode because of the fade outs for nonexistent commercial breaks the pacing is all off on this and its story jumps in fits walker is handsome rugged and has a voice deeper than a well the rest of the cast is full of television actors you have probably seen in other television movies much of the action is pretty lame and the violence is tepid the first brother killed gets a shotgun blast midtorso and falls without a scratch on him i did not expect reservoir dogs but this is the wrong film to use to teach children about the evil of guns speaking of children the mexican kid here goes from cute to aneurysm inducing annoyance very quickly if you dislike westerns then you will dislike yuma if you like westerns then you will still dislike yuma i cannot recommend it this is unrated but contains physical violence and gun violence
casting bone to pick david jannsen was playing the father of robert drivas who was then yeah i realize he s supposed to be just out of college but clues in the script have him being a loafer and so he s probably in the script that still puts jannsen in parenting classes in junior high i assume the ama wrote medical miracle up in their year in medicine this movie hasn t aged very well at all and now it s main appeal is just to see a snap shot of sin city circa and all the incessant smoking the weird hair drivas has an atomic comb over that makes him resemble a well groomed hip cousin it and trendy fashions that went along with it if anyone remembers lv wasn t exactly london the city coddled the mob and codger gamblers in those days drivas comes off as sexually ambiguous his dad thinks he might be gay in a sad irony drivas himself died of aids at and the soapy conflict is from the generation gap issue ahem as if one may call years a gap sonny boy wants to be his own man and dad wants to pull him into the casino caesar s palace and plies him with girls including the horny for money edy williams interestingly enough the son doesn t seem to mind being thought of as gay unusual for the time and a cute brenda vaccarro is nearby to swoon platonically over him what nudity there is is awfully lame just what was needed to pull the audience in for an r rating in the early days of the mpaa rating system which then was g m r and x the editing is horrible and there s stupid silly overdubs by the committee a late s neo avante garde comedy troupe that mercifully faded off the map within a couple of years don rickles is on board as a blackjack dealer seemingly preparing him for a role as a floor manager in the much better casino two decades later not to give anything away but they would ve dealt with mr rickles character with power tools and a hole in the desert back then a curiosity at best far from joshua logan s usual caliber of work dos dias now go watch casino again
i can sum this movie up using words or less way too predictable of a story line with potential to be funny but instead falls flat on its face see words however i didn t completely pan this flick with just one star but instead decided to bump it up to two stars due to the fact that julie bowen is smoking hot and provided just enough eye candy to keep me from ripping the dvd right out from the machine and blowing it up with an m my advice take the rental fee you would have paid to see this movie and just send it right to me as an advance thank you for saving you the time and frustration of having to sit through this train wreck or you may want to send me the replacement fee you would have been charged from taking out your twelve gage to use this piece of garbage as skeet shooting practice
i am very open to foreign films and like to think that i grasp what they are trying to accomplish although some things are lost in translation but the simplicity and intelligence of this film were boring i ve often thought how interesting it would be to make a movie that just shows a typical day or time period that really had no point now that i ve seen a movie like that i will no longer be thinking along those lines there s tones about society racism and some desire but south park has that and when i watch south park it actually moves me to feel an emotion the closest thing i felt to an emotion during this movie was the yawn i experienced after the first five minutes i rate the typical movie a seven or above because i love most every film i gave this film a one
i ve been scolded and scorned by fellow christians for stating my disappointment with this movie i get hounded by statements like these i can t believe you didn t like it it was made totally by christians everyone donated their time and no one was paid for the movie it was made by a church and not hollywood we should spend our money on movies like this they only used to make the film this is by a real church and christian school in georgia a preacher wrote and directed it so apparently the reason i should love this movie is simply because of the way it was made and the minimum amount of money used to make it and that is was made by christians that is all that is needed for me to love the movie look i got the movie without knowing anything about the background of the film i had never heard of it and had no idea other than football what it was about i watched it like i watch any other movie and was disappointed i was disappointed in the lousy editing and lame script i was very disappointed on the resolution after the climax don t worry there have been other cheap movies and other expensively made movies that have earned less respect from me it isn t about the making of the movie it is the end product the writer acknowledges that god doesn t say yes to everything we pray for in the way we want but he wanted to show by having faith god changes our lives that is true however god can change our lives and we re still infertile god can change our lives and we don t get a raise from our job god can change our lives and our car is still an old jalopy god can change our lives and our house is still stinky why didn t he portray that in the movie others voiced their concern to the writer director over the matter but apparently he was defensive i did not think the acting was horrible nor many of the landscape shots i like the idea of going to god and recognizing his awesome power and our weakness the writing and directing were very weak it is easy to distinguish this because many of the characters have no development all we really get from the coach s wife is she is not pregnant well until the end of the movie it seems as if there was only ball player that had the potential to have an interesting character and that was chopped to bits into i have a cripple father and i can t play football well but i ll kick the winning field goal even though i ve never kicked a real field goal before another problem was the christian school itself umm i have worked for two christian schools went to one myself and have had many nieces and nephews in other christian schools all in all i ve had some pretty close connections with about ten different ones none of the problems that i have seen in all of these schools were addressed i saw this as totally surreal in the movie about their school and wished they had shown the human factor it would have been nice to see a dose of reality and how god can work i will close by stating that every work either written or drawn or played on an instrument shares the artist s world view the world view that was shown to me in this movie consists of people who pray the right way win ball games get new cars conceive when they couldn t get a raise and get their house fixed all within a short time span i know i should love the movie simply due to the sincerity of the people who made it i think i should love the movie because it was well done and for no other reason
i knew that evening was a girlie film so i was expecting to be bored a wicked tease on imdb had said that it was a chick flick but that your companion would survive survive yes i am still here but when the two of us came out we were amazed to find that it had only lasted two hours it seemed a much longer evening than that i suppose that for yanks it is supposed to be elevating or fascinating because it is about rich people living on the beach well next to the beach in a house with a wide verandah and a lawn but no apparent lawnmower if that sort of thing impresses you it might seem quite a short film there s a monty python film about a knight who just won t die he ends up a wriggling why do yanks add an third syllable to this word i wonder torso in the road still shouting threats at his nemesis this film is also about a sort of living dead vanessa redgrave inappropriate name for the grave dodger shown here goes on and on dying whilst having inappropriate guilt she s not worried about having been a wide eyed breathless bimbo but imagines herself a murderess obviously being a girlie film there s a chap who is supposed to be the mr darcy heathcliff character i m not a woofter so i can t claim to be a good judge of such things but the tedious wimp who is wheeled out for this role seems only to have the title of servant in his favour he s a bloodless cypher as you might gather the main characters aren t much cop but the minor ones manage amazingly to be much worse there s a fellow whose only job is to react to the news that his girlfriend is preggers fair enough but it isn t the role of hamlet why ham it up so badly forgetting that it was a girlie film i thought he was going to be thrown out because any decent girl friend would have told him that face fungus didn t flatter him but then i realised that she must have encouraged him to grow a beard because he looked worse without it i kept awake by noticing which actors and actresses had their earlobes attached or free and noting interesting bits of scenery if you re dragged along to it see if you can spot the stuffed buffalo head just the sort of thing you d expect in a beach cottage apart from the obligatory wedding there is only one piece of action you d have thought that they d have got it right sadly though the hit and run accident is carried out by a car that couldn t be there when the accident is discovered the cast wander about shouting for a character that they can t know is nearby but we do as the audience if they don t have any clue that the person is within a couple of miles of the place then why do they wander about aimlessly shouting for him i suppose that the director s excuse is that it is supposed to be a half remembered dream sequence another scenery item that caught my attention was a copper bottomed saucepan i didn t think that the technology to do this was developed until the fifties
most movies i can sit through easily even if i do not particularly like the movie i am the type of person who recognizes great films even if i do not like the genre this is the first movie i could not stand to watch cat in the hat is the worst movie i have ever seen and i ve seen a lot of movies the acting is okay myers is good as the cat it s just that he is really annoying the silly songs the cat sings were boring and monotonous even for the children in the audience the plot drags on and on and viewers must suffer through poor dialogue the witty parental remarks are disgusting not funny i remember some awful comment about a garden hoe being compared to well a type of person people call a ho even though the movie is really short it seemed to last forever do not waste your time i know small kids who hated this movie if children can t stand it i do not know how any adults can i would like to fume more about this film but i do not even feel like wasting anymore time writing this review about it i hated it so in summary do not spend minutes of your life watching this see a good movie stars the lowest review i have ever given a movie
my husband and i are the parents of an autistic little boy who lives in the same township as the screenwriter of this movie we were very upset that the jcc is bringing this movie to its jewish film festival because of the way that the mentally disabled character frankie is portrayed we went to see this movie at the local theater when it came out we demanded out money back we would encourage the screenwriter to donate a portion of the funds to the jcc s achad program to apologize we did not like seeing frankie a mentally disabled and perhaps even autistic teenager as part of a joke in which he keeps dropping something to look at the nanny s breasts there was no point to frankie s character other than to say hey being mentally disabled is funny challenges like frankie s are a serious matter families like mine are truly suffering the screenwriter needs to explain herself does she know families with disabled kids does she see the families with disabled kids week after week at the jcc pool
this movie was an attempt to go into places most don t and perhaps shouldn t venture into it was a similar trial at the bizarre head case perspective given to us in the cell although not near as in depth and well portrayed the plot is constructed simply with an initial campy feel to it then as the movie takes its supposed dramatic turn the plot falls apart on what few legs it had to stand on in the first place basically the idea is that of a kid chris mckenna who needs money he takes on the role of a hit man killing a city accountant then he doesn t get paid for his work but instead gets tortured for several days because he dreamed up the brilliant idea of trying to use a backup file he had as leverage for payment this idiotic move at trying to force them to pay him backfires as he is horribly and endlessly abused he begins to go crazy some very disturbing scenes then thinking he has paid for his sins and can start over he visits the wife kari wuhrer of the man who he killed and wins her affections soon after she discovers who he is tragedy strikes and revenge sweeps through the air as the boy goes after his torturers daniel baldwin george wendt vernon wells for their previous kindness i got to ask though what is it with kari wuhrer and horror gore type films it seems everything she has put out lately has been in this genre granted i liked her in eight legged freaks and she was okay in anaconda but despite all her obvious cuteness and allure wow she s hot she can act much better and chose better roles or maybe i m wrong and that is just a misconception for all you guys out there you get to see the fully monty of her in this film although it s rather bizarre and short lived i almost felt like she did some soft porn after watching this film something not foreign to kari s career the sex simulation is such that it has to make you wonder what things really go on during filming anyway i will say there is some good acting just don t expect much of it from daniel balwin whose career seems forever destined to second his brother alex s the film did bring out a few old greats though george wendt norm from cheers and vernon wells commando weird science above all chris mckenna does the best job in playing the main character sean crawley his little acting experience and yet his believable nature as a naive youth bring some elements of substance to the film i wouldn t go out of my way for this one if you re bored and are tired of the same old episodes of the hitchhiker then i might advise watching this and kari please start acting in some better films
this film was so amateurish i could hardly believe what i was seeing it is shot on video not film i have not seen the likes of this since the early s when late night networks showed movie of the week horror flicks shot in video it looks like a bad soap opera and that is paying it a compliment some of the actors give it their best shot michael des barres does okay with what he is given to do which is to act like a sex addict out of control i can t say that it is pleasant to watch nastassja kinski as the therapist sits in a chair for practically the entire film with very little variation in camera angles i can t fault her for someone else s poor blocking but she is totally unbelievable in her role her little girl voice works against her here and i consider myself a nastassja kinski fan she is certainly ageless and exotic but she s outside her range with this alexandra paul is pathetically overwrought every line she delivers is with three exclamation points someone must have directed her to scream at all costs why would michael des barres want to have sex with such a raging shrew finally rosanna arquette as the sweet maligned wife comes off okay and probably the most believable of the bunch but that is not saying much this has to be the worst film i have seen in years
this movie is not the same as the version with judy garland and james mason and that is a shame because the version is in my opinion much better i am not denying barbra streisand s talent at all she is a good actress and brilliant singer i am not acquainted with kris kristofferson s other work and therefore i can t pass judgment on it however this movie leaves much to be desired it is paced slowly it has gratuitous nudity and foul language and can be very difficult to sit through however i am not a big fan of rock music so it s only natural that i would like the judy garland version better see the film with barbra and kris and judge for yourself
one of the worst movies i ve ever seen with robert de niro the fan is a pointless clich of an exercise in slasher flicks it tries to spin or twist the genre with preposterous plot lines of a a crazed fan turned psychotic the movie meanders into nothing spoiler we re to believe that a knife wielding idiot has access to and murders a baseball player in a lavish hotel with no witness security or cameras the movie is nonsense trying to tug at our heart strings through the hoopla of baseball ending up mockingly unsophisticated and gimmicky not sure what all the actors were thinking when they got onboard this razzie this is as big a dud as they come stay far away if you prefer thought in your movies
following the disasterous revolution this film was pretty much the final nail in the coffin of goldcrest and thus the british film industry the film is absolute pants it s full of music from the attempted mid s jazz revival and based on a book author that was briefly popular at that time and has deservedly sank back into obscurity temple searched for ages trying to find suzette and came up with th wonders patsy kensett another person who was briefly popular at the time by the time the film came out of post production the jazz revival was over as was kensett s career and the film met a totally uncaring film public mediocre would be an overstatement for some of the worst campest cheesiest acting to ever grace the british silver screen watching it almost years on and the film is truely cringeworthy
this one probably does not fit in the bottom of the barrel of mediocre slasher movies but it s surely a damn bad movie the holiday premise made it kind of interesting but after the first scenes the movie demonstrates it s poor production values and stupid plot i mean the sub genre was at the moment all about an unseen maniac slashing teens for no apparent reasons but this one took it too far there is absolutely no coherence in the events or nothing else to add the clich s are more than boring the gore is minimal and so does the mystery this is a fairly mediocre slasher entry that shouldn t be hyped even if it has a video nastie label i am truly disappointed by this overrated piece of trash
i so wanted to believe in this movie after the only form of mainstream comedy this country recognises is slapstick and stereotypes of course it went completely the other way let s be cool and edgy and came out the other side with little to show for it i bet one small seed went nuts for this i know sl did none of the main characters have the comedic chops to pull it off even danny k had better timing i m actually being serious every time they introduced a bit character i kept thinking darn this person should have been the lead independent doesn t mean that the camera work needs to be horrible black and white did nothing for this movie actually with such flat dialogue it hurt this even more by bringing the boredom into sharp relief the black and white also wasn t crisp the composition was horrible the use of music was horrible strangely enough i watched little miss sunshine after this movie and the composition on that was superb maybe that s why the deficiencies in this movie stick out in my mind i think corne who was funnier than the leads before he even said anything was speaking to this movie and not david see it and you ll understand i bet the guys who organise oppikoppi were dismayed one would think nothing happens there at all i got the feeling it could have been filmed in someone s back garden i know regular guys who have much funnier raunchier and wittier conversations than any of these comics the dude who they hooked up with end was ok though guess sa comedy s gonna stay in the stone age a little longer nice work guys
cut is a film about some film students making a film it s very much in the scream mold an ironic self referential horror flick which for me at least falls down because for all its irony it s still just a bad horror film same as the films its referring to but it was not without its charms well one charm anyway molly ringwald was fantastic as the spoilt bitchy american actress hating every minute of working with the amateur australian film crew she was so convincing that its tempting to believe it wasn t an act although everyone involved with cut says she was lovely to work with seriously every scene of her pouting sulking or snapping was great everyone else however wavered between being ok and being terribly wooden anyway cut has some laughs a few buckets of gore some of it surprisingly gruesome and ultimately is just another bad horror film
well here we have yet another role reversal movie there were many worth watching despite the tired plot of gender reversal however this one is not in previous reviews i think i ve made my point about the general decline of enjoyment for haim movies that followed the late s this is one of them just one of the girls is about a high school kid corey haim who tries to avoid his bullies by dressing up as a girl and attending another school he joins the cheerleading squad and makes friends with fellow cheerleader marie nicole eggert obviously he can t keep up the charade for too much longer i thought this movie was utter crap and it wasn t even funny but judging by a majority of reviews it looks like fans of alanis morrisette or teen sex queen nicole eggert are the only ones who d want to watch this if you re looking for a good haim feature or role switching comedy look no further than this is about the point that haim s career tanked
well what can i say what the bleep do we know has achieved the nearly impossible leaving behind such masterpieces of the genre as the postman the dungeon master merlin and so fourth it will go down in history as the single worst movie i have ever seen in its entirety and that ladies and gentlemen is impressive indeed for i have seen many a bad movie this masterpiece of modern cinema consists of two interwoven parts alternating between a silly and contrived plot about an extremely annoying photographer abandoned by her husband and forced to take anti depressants to survive and a bunch of talking heads going on about how quantum physics supposedly justifies their new agy pseudo philosophy basically if you start your day off meditating to the likes of enya and kenny g this movie is for you if you have a sense of humor a crowd of people who know how to have fun and a sizable portion of good weed then this movie is for you as well otherwise stay away take my word for it the first thing that struck me about what the bleep do you know is that is seemed to be edited and put together by the same kinds of people that shoot cheap weddings on camera complete with pink heart effects computer generated sparkles across the screen and other assorted silliness who let these people anywhere near a theatrical release is a mystery to me i guess this is what too much kenny g does to you the movie was permeated with cheesy gci the likes that you or i can produce on our own computer via over the counter video editing software but never would because it s just way too ridiculous the script was obviously written by someone with no writing experience whatsoever not only were all the characters and conversations cumbersome and contrived beyond belief but the writers felt like they had to shove every relevant piece of information or rather disinformation which is what most of this movie was all about all the way down your throat well given the target audience that may not have been too bad of an idea the main character for example spends half the movie popping pills apparently though it was deemed not convincing enough so there are at least a couple of dialogs in throughout which refer to her anti anxiety pills specifically just in case the viewers should not be able to connect her overacted pain and suffering with little white pills she takes whenever she feels down the acting well i ve seen better acting in ed wood movies and no this is not an exaggeration heck the little play i was in when i was featured much more inspiring acting than this it really did the story is interrupted here and there with a bunch or random talking heads a strange mix of kooky scientists kooky doctors and self proclaimed mystics go on and on about how quantum physics supposedly provides an explanation for how ever man or woman created their own reality just by participating in the experience of life reality you see is a probability field of a bunch of different possibilities and is only set in stone once you the observer chose to notice it what happens when more than one observer observes they didn t say but then again who cares listen to enya meditate observe and you shall be god and nobody gives a damn about such silly and archaic things as critical thinking logic etc all reason is immediately dismissed as people being stuck in their ways and unable to achieve a paradigm shift and go down the rabbit hole furthermore the heidelberg uncertainty principle supposedly is proof positive of alternate realities parallel universes and such speaking of rabbit holes the analogy permeates the movie all of these people keep talking about going down rabbit holes i m not sure what that had to do with anything else they were saying or showing but one thing i m certain of is that it somehow involves anal sex actually the movie is extremely anti sex throughout sex is presented as dirty ugly and anti enlightening in any case the talking heads talk the main character achieves harmony and enlightenment by painting hearts all over her body with a magic marker and proceeds to walk around with an even stupider look in her glazed over eyes than she started with i want hours of my life back here s a couple of random quotes which i happened to remember what i think of as unreal has become a lot more real to me and that which i used to consider real is oftentimes a lot less real than the unreal some talking head on the spirituality of quantum physics what does it take for one man to have an erection it takes just one thought nothing changes on the outside all the changes are within an yet he has an erection some self proclaimed mystic head of her own school of enlightenment while looking at herself in the mirror i hate you i hate you you re fat you re ugly i have you main character the fat and ugly photographer
amen to magsel there was a lot of confusion going on first off how do you know which movie you are purchasing henry cele stars in every one of them i bought this movie thinking it was the miniseries what a letdown it would have been a comedy but for the young girl being raped david hasselhoff spelling is ok for popcorn tv but he was not believable in this film where was his english accent and what s with the love story the movie was supposed to be about a young man s rise to military power not the slave ship captain getting jiggly with the english maiden looking for her daddy if i had paid more than for this movie i would have to call the police because that would be a crime
my year old daughter loved it as disney execs crassly calculated that she would that s the problem with air buddies it s a strictly by the numbers children s film filled with carefully calculated cuteness a couple politically correct morals and enough potty humor to avoid the dreaded g rating as a parent or even as a year old you ve seen it all before and done better before think dalmatians meets home alone and you get the general idea i m of the opinion that a good children s story is a good story period air buddies which is about as original as recycled paper fails to meet that standard it isn t the worst video your child could watch but there are megatons of better ones
my take a tired formula christmas comedy the laughs are tired and the talents behind it seem to be too i love the holidays as much as the next guy even if i often have a bad case of the holiday blues but it seems it s just being a dumping ground for a bunch of holiday comedies that would be bad movies on any day of the year but that doesn t make them any less painful during the season as if we already had enough santa clause movies three and gulp still counting who wants to see a movie about his brother in a plot that would be at home with disney s santa clause franchise save the occasionally crude humor and santa s little helper wearing a short skirt fred claus is a one joke premise that goes on for minutes sure jolly ol saint nick has a brother but where does it go from there it s a shame really fred claus is blessed with a cast that could have made it an enjoyable christmastime comedy that will probably melt away along with the snow but it would have been so much better than this vince vaughn is your typical snob but we are led to believe he s really the long lost brother of the never aging santa paul giamatti who invites his good ol brother to visit mrs claus miranda richardson is reluctant and worse an efficiency expert kevin spacey has come to keep a watchful eye on father christmas and his this close to being shut down hah and guess who plays santa s mother kathy bates of course elizabeth banks is santa s helper charlene john michael higgins is one of the elves and rachel wiesz plays fred s girlfriend si don t know if i d praise the casting or to bash it here we have some familiar faces to add a touch of quality but they re given way too little to work with as for humor the best that fred claus could possibly come up with is santa s brother being his exact opposite and some joke about a dj elf i have to admit i had a few giggles involving fred attending a group counseling for celebrity brothers where he is joined by stephen baldwin roger clinton and frank stallone but the giggles begin and end there worse still the movie even succumbs into sentimentality that s supposed to make us feel good and teach us a lesson about what christmas really means apparently what christmas means to hollywood is getting as much of our leftover christmas shopping money as they can rating out of
this is possibly one of the worst giant killer animal movies i have ever seen it follows the typical premise of a laboratory experiment gone wrong and a giant crocodile with a rapid growth chemical in it escapes the monster looks way to much like a dinosaur having big tyranosaurous like hind legs when it should just look like an over sized crocodile everything about this movie is unoriginal and it constantly oozes cliche minute after minute why are there always two drunken redneck hunters out after dark who separate plus there s always a guy and girl who share a lame obvious love interest while they are in life threatening situations to much has already been said by me and i feel as if i m wasting my time writing this
i thought i was going to watch a scary movie and ended up laughing all the way throughout the movie in the scene where the human transformed to a werewolf i thought they was kidding todays computer games have ten times better animations low budget is a fitting comment i would recommend wolf with jack nicholson for a good werewolf movie it has good special effects as they should be human transforming to werewolf unless you wish to have good laugh i would not recommend you to watch this movie this movie is a joke
this is a movie that demonstrates that mood and music and texture aren t enough to make a good film sure the viewer is treated to numerous fine scenes of los angeles in the thirties i especially liked the view of the trolley approaching the tunnel and the tram rising up the hillside but in a sense this fine cinematography is self defeating because it creates a mood that something s going to happen and nothing does the script too keeps feinting toward some plot or action or trauma and time after time not delivering not even delivering the i assume theme of the movie the characters essential misfit the lead actors both too pretty for their roles didn t convey any repression or agony and the script didn t expose us to any now donald sutherland that s another story his character was so well fashioned so perfectly played that i wanted the camera to follow him
this is the single worst movie i have ever seen i cannot express how bad it is i honestly wanted to kill myself several times through this atrocious experience just to have the pain end i recommend instead of seeing this movie you bathe in acid then you will at least know a fraction of the pain without all of the scars i had such high expectations when i read the back of the dvd case and when in the beginning it added that jesus was following them i was so excited then by the end i wanted to kill myself i mean a twenty three minute introduction to the most annoying characters in the history of cinema just pain monkeys could have done a better job editing this trash at least they would have thrown feces and blurred some of the garbage it would have made it better to have not seen any of the horror it wasn t that i didn t get the jokes it s that they were not only not funny they repeated themselves like twenty times apparently something isn t funny unless you see it like a million times do not under any circumstances see this people have rated manos the hands of fate as the worlds worst movie i have seen that too and agree that it is bad but alas it is only the second worst fatty drives the bus is by far worse this deserves all kind of harsh language but i can t write that here so just imagine i swore a whole bunch
it doesn t even merit a review other than as a warning to potential viewers it s a somewhat generic ghost story about an actress haunting a studio during the filming of a wwii period drama there s no fear involved no suspense whatsoever nor any surprises one shocking moment that looks a bit too silly to be shocking the visual style is very flat and dull although there is some really nice editing once in a while the story never comes together and the films is really just a total bust
in fact marc blitzstein s off broadway adaptation of threepenny was not so bowdlerised as is generally believed i have a special interest in threepenny my dad was part of the first full production in the us u of illlinois theatre guild did it around the end of ww hjitler had been so nearly successful in suppressing the play that they had to reconstruct the script and score from recordings in two different languages neither english a german prompter s script and similar sources blitzstein s adaptation not a translation which had the full approval of lotte lenya was a lot closer to the original than generally believed the problem is that the version thereof that most people know is the mgm cast recording recently available on polygram on cd which includes beatrice arthur as lucy the big complete girl and can t i see her hands on hips and shoulders thrown back on that line bea was a major babe in the s paul dooley and john astin was heavily censored by mike curb head of mgm records i mean i think it was goddamn s got cut to just damn at one time mgm also offered a lp set of the entire play doubtless as heavily censored
this was in short a terrible disappointment by far the worst adaptation of one of my favourite novels the dialogue was horribly clumsy i could sense no feeling behind the words expressed by the characters the lines were delivered too hastily and felt rather out of place they could just as well have been cited by statues the chemistry between george c scott and susannah york was non existent and watching an american rochester felt strange he could have at least tried to do a british accent i like george c scott as an actor but this simply did not work i felt like i was watching highlights from jane eyre where the main pieces of the story had been randomly put together with no regard to the flow of the story the scenery and music were all very nice but i could feel none of the passion and love that is supposed to be between jane and rochester and the movie left me totally unmoved if you want to see a good version of jane eyre i suggest you watch the bbc version with timothy dalton and zelah clarke or the version with ciar n hinds and samantha morton now these two are brilliant adaptations
other than the great cinematography by the marvelous james wong howe in the battle scenes this film is a true stinker this is the second film that i ve seen in recent days directed by alexander korda the first was charles laughton s rembrandt it was so lousy that i shut it off this one i m afraid is not very much better flora robson is as ugly as ever as queen elizabeth perhaps her performance as the virgin queen was good for standards but when you compare it to that of a helen mirren it is absolutely no match in robotic fashion robson states her lines her battle message to the english troops is so lackluster in spirit even a dashing laurence olivier can t save this utter piece of boredom future wife vivien leigh is in a supporting role here and she doesn t really convey anything here to think that scarlett was years later it s a shame that history with the spanish armada is made out to be so boring in this film
i really wanted to like this movie i absolutely love kenny hotz and spenny rice has a charming side to him not that i like spenny at all spenny ruins this movie he should of let kenny and his hot girlfriend pitch the movie anyways it s pretty boring aside from a scene with roger ebert in it there really isn t too many celebrities in this movie and most don t seem to say more than one line overall this movie was disappointing i would only suggest watching it if you got it with the season dvd of kenny vs spenny it comes for free on the rd disc regardless of this production i am still very excited to check out the papel chase
this was the first ewan mcgregor movie i ever saw outside of star wars since then i have become a very big ewan mcgregor fan but i still can t bring myself to forgive this movie s existence my sister has always been a huge jane austen fan and because of that i have been subjected to various of the classics emma being one of them i ve always considered them irritating stupid and boring however after watching this terrible rendition i was forced to admit that the original emma was delightful and charming ewan mcgregor scarcely serves a purpose in this film after they hacked and mutilated the part of frank churchill gweneth paltrow is ridiculous in an already ridiculous character and the rest of the film is unremarkable and stupid my recommendation to anybody who is remotely interested in english period drama go see the originals if you re a ewan mcgregor fan believe me by skipping this film you haven t missed anything but five minutes collective of him in a silly hat and a bad haircut
when i saw that mary louise parker was associated with this epic novel turned film i was intrigued being a fan of the book i assumed she d be playing tony roz or charis but more so i was intrigued to see how they would turn this very head y almost psychological but not psychological thriller novel in to a movie that would be accessible to those who hadn t read the novel and that would be at least mildly satisfying for those who had the book is a complex reflection of society women and modern life and i was interested to see how they used the different narratives that lead to the unfolding of the story in a film what they actually did was a crime the biggest error and confusing issue is why would oxygen a network that advertises as being for women take an amazing book about how complex wonderful and terrible women are and can be and change the protagonist from women to some dumb former cop with no real motive to be involved in the story it seems like whoever adapted it took an easy way out by using this guy to straight up ask roz tony and charis about how they knew zenia and in doing that they rushed through bulk of the book in doing this though they muddied the story and cut everything that is great about the characters in it aside from making it so the audience had no one credible to associate with in the film these women aren t people they are characters in the book zenia does fake her death but the book mentions it to get this point across while the film wastes minutes focusing on this former cop running around and doing nothing of use they tried to make this complex book an episode of law and order or csi it turns out that mary louise parker played zenia which was so wrong zenia is a catherine zeta jones angelina jolie or maybe even a scarlett johnasson type she is a woman men can t not adore and a woman that women are intrigued and threatened by but in a keep your enemies closer kind of way and once she gets closer she seems totally genuine and trust worthy despite your better judgment she s the kind of woman who even when she loses she wins she s always still beautiful still rich and there are always still people out there who don t know her game in the film zenia didn t take charis s man the blonde american draft dodger who was using charis in the first place but instead took august and tried to become her legal guardian and apparently came back to be her lesbian lover as a lingering kiss at the coffee shop implies and zenia did kill the chickens before leaving with august but it made no sense since all of the build up to it was removed it s was as if whoever wrote the screenplay was grasping at straws to satisfy those of us who read the book but i think had i not read the book i would have spent the whole movie confused if i had bothered to stick with it at all and roz s husband was dead before zenia came in to the picture which was weird since zenia took roz s business and home life in the book which is why roz hated her so much and she and zenia had conspired to kill roz s husband years and years back and according to the film tony and west had been dating forever even at the party where zenia and west in the book had painted the whole place black and they made tony seem like this totally with it and evil bitchy person who was always respected by everyone for her intelligence and popular for it tony s character was so wrong in this film she seemed a little psycho and like the mastermind behind whatever conspiring was going down as opposed to the kind of gawky mildly reclusive teacher that she was in the book the film basically implied smart women are evil beautiful women are evil powerful women are evil and women who teach yoga are off their rockers they basically tried to make it so zenia wasn t necessarily as awful as she was in the book and then in the end the three women convince this former cop who of course in the process of researching this meets zenia and has an affair with her that is supposed to end with them moving to barbados or something ridiculous which of course zenia bails on to hide zenia s body which they found splat at the hotel she was staying at but the film implies that one of the three women pushed her over the balcony or they conspired together to do it and then zenia also managed to take all of roz s money in the process by the end of the film i was only half paying attention between commercials b c it had spiraled so far out in space from what it could and should have been if you aren t confused by this breakdown of the film then maybe you would like it because i have read the book and seen the movie and from the movie alone i am ridiculously confused it was terrible i get that making a film out of that book is quite a task but if you are going to take on the task you should start by determining what in the book is unnecessary instead of creating some useless character to be our alice in wonderland are there really no fluffier books that oxygen could be making at least half decent tv movies of
i have seen many good korean movies including thrillers and movies with darker overtone but this one sucks the director seems to be a sadist who happened to get someone to produce some junk the movie lacks any sort of entertainment value and is not even a thriller i can t believe someone really made such a movie even though acting is ok the story line and the feeling it leaves is awful i am sure i am not going to see any movies of this director no sense of movie making and utter disappointment in having thriller moments all this has is showing scenes with psychopath wasting the reels with badly shot scenes and showing more blood and violence thinking that makes it thrilling very disappointing movie and i strongly recommend skipping all the movies of this sort
i m sorry but i didn t like this doc very much i can think of a million ways it could have been better the people who made it obviously don t have much imagination the interviews aren t very interesting and no real insight is offered the footage isn t assembled in a very informative way either it s too bad because this is a movie that really deserves spellbinding special features one thing i ll say is that isabella rosselini gets more beautiful the older she gets all considered this only gets a
this would have to be one of the worst if not the worst movie i ve ever nearly seen i couldn t watch it all the way through purely and simply it s gratuitous violence just for the sake of it and the ridiculous story line only adds to the lacklustre and incompetent filming sick and only suitable for those with a love for manic mutilation after murdering several hundred men women and children seed is finally caught after effortlessly killing several more police officers that finally get a tip as to his whereabouts he s sentenced to death by electric chair and miraculously survives buried alive he digs his way out and plots revenge against those that put him away and flicked the switch needless to say more gruesome murders ensue
probably one of the most boriest slasher movies ever badly acted and badly written the plot five students staying behind during the holidays closing down a dorm but somebody has designs on them and starts killing them off one by one the main suspect is the creepy groundskeeper john hemmitt played by woody roll or could it be one of the five characters acting not that bad not that great either apart from daphne zungia who dies way too quickly and should have been the main heroine and the rest well quite dull although laura lapinski the main heroine sometimes has her charm and you do feel sorry for her in the end the kills can t really see why they banned this the kills look fake mostly one guy has his hand sliced in half in the beginning which looks really fake but the others are quite nasty like one girl gets her head run over by a car one girl gets boiled alive and another gets burned alive overall not really a great slasher could have been a lot better
what does the executive producer do in a movie if i remember correctly it s the person who raised the financial backing to make the movie you might notice in a great number of movies starring sean connery that he is also the executive producer which meant connery himself raised the money since he is a major player unfortunately it should also be pointed out that a great number of movies starring sean connery were solely made because he managed to raise the money since he s a major hollywood player it s usually an indication that when the credits read that the executive producer and the star of the movie are one and the same the movie itself is nothing more than a star vehicle with the story screenplay not being up to scratch protocol follows the saga of one sunny davis a kooky bimboesque cocktail waitress who saves a visiting dignitary and as a reward gets made a top diplomat likely as things progress ms davis who has problems being able to string two sentences together finds herself in more outlandish and less likely situations when i say that protocol stars goldie hawn who is also the film s executive producer do you understand what i m saying about the story screenplay not being up to scratch exactly
i must say when i read the storyline on the back of the case it sounded really interesting but when i started to watch the movie seemed boring at first and even more at the end some scenes are way too long and the story has not been worked out properly
deep sh is more like it the eels are just cartooned in over the film think the incredible mr limpet meets leviathan very tacky no character or relationship development so called romantic scenes very corny and predictable an interesting idea but a poorly written script and lousy special effects make this a definite must miss
the form of the film is that of a suspense shocker there are surprises twists and turns reverses and excitements at times this is truly an edge of the seat film but it disappoints and disappoints severely the villain of the piece is not believeable his character does not hold together i refuse to spoil the film but will only say that the character we meet at the beginning just could not be he whom we see at the end the second major disappointment of the film is that finally it becomes little more that a bloody slasher film there is little qualitative difference between this and one of the friday the th films not that every film need always be totally tasteful but this film does drip gore on occasion though the film features the magnificent sean connery even he does not measure up to his usual standard and often just seems to be walking through the paces
my sincere advice to all don t watch the movie don t even go near to the theater where this movie is being played even a glimpse of it is bad for health serious no jokes it s am in the morning and i returned from this crappiest movie on this universe four hours damn i am proud that i survived after all of it if this is called survival i am highly frustrated annoyed disappointed it was sheer waste of time money went in drain no plot hope i wake up tomorrow sane and with no memories of this night rubbish movie happy republic day to one and all
no spoilers here but i have been a fan since waking the dead started but the last series of which only have been on so far is awful the stories bear no resemblance to the original idea of the series i found these in the last series jaw droppingly ludicrous as a bbc licence payer after the show i rang bbc complaints to pass on my disappointment i m amazed that actors of the calibre of trevor eve and sue johnstone didn t object to the story lines these actors have been with these characters for seasons surly they can see it s lost all direction it s a good job it is the last series or the next series may start with the team investigating the death of father christmas paul bentley west yorkshire england
i first didn t want to watch this film for the trailer gave the impression of a common and too expected film but as i recently had the pleasure to discover the surprising mensonges et trahisons et plus si affinit which was beautifully directed and written by laurent tirard screenwriter of pr te moi ta main i changed my mind and decided to try it thinking that pr te moi ta main would be as good as mensonges and it is absolutely not the script is not bad but it is not as well directed as mensonges the actors not as generous especially charlotte as boring as she usually is as edouard baer or clovis cornillac and too be honest i still don t understand how such crap can have such a success even with such a casting anyway the story could have been a pretext to create so many interesting plots but it is not as good as tirard s mensonges though it s also written by him easy unsurprising and lazy work totally overestimated
okay like most steven seagal fans i know i not going expect a masterpiece every time he makes a film but i do expect the film to at least have some sorter budget the main problem with the copy i watched was the terrible over dubbing i know that in some films this has to be done and i accept that but when they overdub with a totally different actors voice and keep doing this thru out the film it does take the magic of overdubbing away also the sets seem to be built with no care as in one scene the sliding glass top in a top secret lab has a massive crack going thru it i was truly disappointed with this film and only hope stevens next project will be more finished off before sending the film out for buying renting the story of this film had me wondering if i was watching a sci fi film or not some parts seemed alien like but they never fully explained what was going on i found it very confusing
apart from helen bonham carter there is nothing worthy about this movie and the surprise ending the thought of a sequel is even more annoying save your money wait for the video and ignore that too
i agree with the majority of the comments i have seen written i grew up watching seseme street before a lot of the people who have written comments were even born i was born in so i was yrs old when seseme street was introduced to television the show taught me my numbers the count spelling the muppet and about life i liked all the old characters big bird oscar grover and cookie monster and don t quite understand why they had to change i understand that everything has to change in some way but to make cookie monster into a veggie monster to promote healthy eating the show has introduced new characters and monsters since it s inception why not make a separate veggie monster that talks discusses the benefits of eating a varied diet with cookie monster but back to my point i grew up watching the very beginning of seseme street my now yr old daughter grew up watching ss with me along side her and we discussed mr hooper dying although he had died prior to her being born as well as other topics on the show i saw the episode as a older child and still remember how well they portrayed the event much like real life and i m sure it hit the cast extremely hard as all deaths and losses effect families you saw this on the show and it allowed parents and children to discuss very difficult events the show has talked about traditional families adoptive families and combined families it s one of the few shows that actually discusses these scenarios i now have a yr old daughter who really doesn t watch ss i ve tried to watch the show a couple of times but it really is not what it used to be the elmo hr with mr noodle is absolutely ridiculous like many people have said it doesn t teach anything it s geared for the less than month old maybe and isn t even funny i always prided myself on watching ss as a child teen and adult with my own child now on my second go round i really have a hard time watching ss the topics that were discussed death marriage non traditional families new to neighborhoods moving away were related to children and adults in a manner easy for year old to understand and relate to now there are no concepts taught minimal counting only the occasional mention of the alphabet it is not the same ss from an original watcher of the show please if any producers from the show read these comments return the show to its foundation new concepts have never been a problem with ss they just used to have a better way to incorporate them into the show
i ll be blunt and to the point this film is not good at all the film buff part of me hated the acting script story direction and almost all of the editing amanda peet has proven that she can act as she was a high point of the whole nine yards so she should have avoided this movie with a ten foot pole however the infantile part of me found this film to be very funny if you can forget about how underpar the production quality is and if you find smut jokes funny then you should be all right and for those of you who can t get off your pedestal thats your choice my inner child hasen t died and i laughed a fair bit even then only a out of ten because as a movie it really does stink
the only thing that an inconvenient truth proves is that al gore is still an idiot these unchallenged experts are unchallenged because a response to their inane hypotheses is generally beneath real science this is mostly false science folks the greatest source of greenhouse gases co is people we exhale it and unless you re willing to start sacrificing your brethren to save the world there s not a darn thing to be done we ve heard how the world was going to end as the result of man for more than years fools publish a time line for their doomsday and when the time passes nothing has happened an inconvenient truth is just another vehicle with which a disingenuous faction of american society can peddle their poop and as to al leaving the tobacco business because of his sister s death from cancer that is a load too al couldn t run his farm any better than he could run the country he was losing money on the operation because he didn t care to farm when he could make more on speaking tours the only global warming that is unchallenged is the hot air produced by this gasbag
it is cheese if all you want is a video game complete with what look like straight from the computer cutaway sequences for action the film was too cheap to actually make special effects for this is it my friend and i actually had a great time seeing it since the theatre was mostly empty and we could heckle a bit this movie really requires heckling plot there was a plot ok some stupid college or later types get invited to the rave of the year and go to one of the san juan islands if they d only stayed back in seattle they would have survived direct quote or nearly to attend they get there and everyone is gone and the site is somewhat wrecked but hey the keg is still full with the help of a crusty old captain and a coast guard woman who acted only slightly less tough and slightly less well than cynthia rothrock they fight lots of zombies some which spit acid get an earful of freaky legends and mostly get killed that s about it it s not quite as bad as demonicus but not by much and still better than severed they are sort of my own personal alpha and omega for bad movies the former is bad but fun to heckle and the latter is just too freaking bad to watch more than once on the other hand if you re expecting a video game movie as excellent as resident evil run away run away now ok some real big questions without too many spoilers since when did spanish ships of the th century venture into the pacific northwest why is anyone in the pacific northwest smuggling guns and to whom canada for crying out loud why is a rave on an unnamed oh excuse me it s called isla del muerto shya right san juan island and outdoors still keeping in mind this is the pacific northwet and the rave has about people in attendance the rave of the year my patoot lucky thing there s lots of hatchets around lots of them everyone has them must be a hatchet sales outlet nearby finally while the movie started out playing with a little parody with nudges at i know what you did and jaws it didn t carry it through near enough ok really finally when the introductory comments in a voice over no less casually mention that one of the characters gave up her boyfriend to focus on her fencing you can be darn sure there ll be some fencing by the end of the movie not good fencing but a couple of people hacking at each other with swords anyway
i usually come on this website prior to going to the movies as i like to see what other people think of the movie i read many reviews which said thriller not a horror movie this prompted me to give this film a try i really must take issue with these thriller horror statements as it was neither i almost went and asked for my money back and if you lot of reviewers enjoyed this rubbish well you must be easily pleased at the end of the movie the people behind me said out loud what a waste of time and i turned to them and replied i couldn t have summed it up better i kept waiting for something to happen but it didn t there was the potential for a lot of good scares or thrills if you like but none happened williams acted the part quite well but i felt he was short changed by a poor script which dithered around and went nowhere save your money folks this is a turkey which will be featuring at a dvd store bargain box near you in the very foreseeable future
certainly one of the dozen or so worst movies ever released in any form featuring a bizarrely abominable performance by rain joan of arc phoenix river s sister inevitably as bonanza jellybean plus inconceivably awful voiceover narration by tom robbins the author of the novel which had retains its peculiar sweet loopy charms
hunters chase what they think is a man through the forest though the audience sees he is a werewolf the hunters never seem to realize this because after they shoot him he looks normal when they decapitate him a doctor transplants the werewolf s eyes into a man who lost his own in a laboratory experiment the man rich gets to have sex with his nurse stephanie beaton before he even gets his bandages removed after he leaves the hospital he finds his wife has been cheating on him too when a smoke machine sends clouds past an amateur painting of a moon with a fake tree branch on the foreground he turns into a werewolf his torso grows larger splitting his shirt and he grows a giant werewolf mask on his head that has red lights in the eyes his pants stay intact the mouth chews unconvincingly though some sort of robotics or hidden hands in the eyebrows give him a baleful look at times despite the poor werewolf costume there is a fair amount of blood and gore and those are fairly well done there s even a pretty good decapitation later in the movie however when a man falls from a height a rather bad dummy does the job rich has a friend named siodmak who is some sort of occult expert and he also accidentally stumbles across a small man with crutches named androse who is also such an expert they try to help him a little rich kills people who have done him wrong a policewoman investigates the murders and tries to hit on beaton who doesn t much care for lesbian scenes so nothing comes of it quite cheap but between the nudity and blood and gore and a not terrible story combining sort of the most dangerous game with the hands of orlac and the wolf man it s somewhat entertaining available on its own or in the box set scream queens vol
alien love as this movie is known in britain is a very strange movie i don t mean that it s an esoteric art house movie in the style of peter greenaway or derek jarman i mean it s a tvm with swearing sex some really good t a a bad script and a very retro feel you can just imagine someone like john hughes directing this ten years earlier though of course he would have cut out the t a going back to the bad script one of the problems is that few of the characters have any type of motivation especially amanda why does she pick up connie at the bar just so she could meet an alien do you see what i mean about retro et short circuit and a whole lot of other movies from the mid s had this type of plot with most of them being more defined and convincing than the one seen here the storyline continues to follow an ill defined unconvincing and illogical path that said i did find alien love watchable and not only down to the t a on display as a a sci fi sex comedy it s much better than flesh gordon and earth girls are easy
i really wish that when making a comedy the people actually tried to make it funny this is a film that you can sit through but nothing is special about it after watching it you will say that it was alright it was not boring to watch but gave the audience no jokes to laugh at entertainment should mean that you actually get something more than an o k story this movie wanted to be tootsie but instead it failed i gave it a out of
too many secondary plot lines without a primary one too many hot buttons are pushed without any reason they managed to stuff this boring film that does not say anything with every drama element that is out there death divorce money issues parenting problems suicide psychological problems drug abuse adoption rejected love traveling problems sex generations misunderstandings robbery legal issues guns medical ethics deep real love you would think that it would make for an interesting movie but hell no all these events are secondary to something primary which is not there boring not to mention that the super deep and super long lecture to the child at the end of the film is a total nonsense pity oh forgot to mention the actors all of them are quite good that s what kept me from turning it off to bad their talents went to waste the film is well shot too the light the motion etc of every episode that s all in place it s just the meaning that s missing
recreation of s london soho and the up and coming people based on a cult novel julian temple is a video director no more no less give him million dollars and he will make you a million dollar pop video here he forgets that two minutes with people that can t really act is one thing but two hours what was he thinking of besides who are the audience who cares about a book that was well remembered way back when the usual london story of the chancer taking his chance what could really drag this film even further down oh i know third rate songs that sound like they were made up on the spot david bowie crones the film title over and over a few times and that is the highlight the soundtrack album is clay pigeon material there is one good thing though good recreation of period soho shame they couldn t think of anything to put in front of it
okay the story makes no sense the characters lack any dimensionally the best dialogue is ad libs about the low quality of movie the cinematography is dismal and only editing saves a bit of the muddle but sam peckinpah directed the film somehow his direction is not enough for those who appreciate peckinpah and his great work this movie is a disappointment even a great cast cannot redeem the time the viewer wastes with this minimal effort the proper response to the movie is the contempt that the director san peckinpah james caan robert duvall burt young bo hopkins arthur hill and even gig young bring to their work watch the great peckinpah films skip this mess
william hurt scuba diving scientist us agents running the investigation abroad the sick contaminated man kicking butt after falling feet on his back and running away sniper missing and not killing hurt just wounding him but the second kill shot is dead on waste of time to compare this to falling down as other reviewers did is ridiculous oh and by the end of the movie they decide to start wearing gloves on their hands except for the evil agent and hurt decides to kill him by giving him the virus handshake what btw when did imdb require lines of text i m just babbling here doesn t this just dillute the content of reviews if you are required to have x amount of lines
this movie not a film clearly recorded on a cheap cam corder may be one of the greatest cinematic stink bombs in history beware the packaging advertises the flick as an erotic exploration of sex addiction the film is not an exploration of anything and it is no more erotic than staring at one s own warts the script is pointless and meandering with all plot elements serving as segways between supposed sex scenes however even the sex scenes are lame lame lame except for the first they are around three seconds long then again maybe my version was cut and comically overwrought if you are looking for a decent film you don t want this if you are looking for a titillating sex flick you don t want this whatever your life s goals desires or perspectives you do not want to watch this movie how they got rosanna arquette natashia kinski and ed begly to act in this stink bomb is puzzling in the extreme
this movie should not classify as cinema although it is over years old now it should never ever have gotten funding and is a blight on the australian film industry which is now producing such brilliant films as the dish the actors cannot act the music is to be blunt not music the storyline is completely nonexistent and is a struggle to sit through do not watch this film it is a complete waste of your time
things i learned from the list a decent cinematographer a hot girl who can act and malcom mcdowell couldn t stop this movie from sucking blockbuster won t give you your money back even when he reads the script and says ugh really malcom mcdowell still tries chuck carrington desperately needs acting classes hire a writer jesus hates me too and punished me by making me pay to see this movie when making a movie you don t need an ending just leave everything unexplained unresolved an uninteresting enough so that the audience falls asleep before the ending genius any random landlord can cure death just by drawing a cross on a window so make friends your maid can sing you back to life chuck carrington still needs acting classes your roommate will hate you and make fun of you if you bring home this movie apologies will not be accepted
a vampire s s henchman wants to call her after falling in love with a five dollar hooker in this extremely low budget horror comedy i can t explain all the positive comments on this movie i ll chalk it up to mass hallucination but it s disconcerting none the less the one redeeming factor and this is me being extremely generous here might be the grandfather who s the only semi likable character in this whole mess don t waste your money or time in fact here s a word of advice if troma puts it out on dvd but does not make it themselves in all likelihood it s crap troma dvd extras commentary with omar and kirk second commentary with cast and crew deleted scenes bloopers troma interactivity radiation march clip from terror firmer theatrical trailer trailers for the rowdy girls teenage catgirls in heat cannible the musical and toxic avenger my grade d
devil s experiment hardcore porn films fall into two categories those with a semblance of plot gee that is one lucky pizza boy and those without anal amateurs devil s experiment falls solidly into the latter category it is of course the horror version of hardcore porn an almost completely plot less minute wait for the money shot shot on video in it consists of three relatively non descript japanese boys torturing one fairly unattractive japanese girl the tortures range from the banal slapping her times kicking her a hundred the silly tying her to an office chair and spinning her around the fear factor a bath of maggots and sheep guts and finally the money shot a well executed eyeball piercing that s it no plot no motive just blair witch tree shots and torture the girl looks bored and with the exception of yelling no one expects the spanish inquisition during the office chair scene i was bored silly staring dumbfounded at the screen waiting for the money shot just like hardcore porn
rajinikanth becomes born again after getting a magical power which he can use seven times there are several problems with this movie that are obvious to the casual audience the ish rajinikanth is still at home with his parents the father of the girl next door thinks that he is a compelling boy vaseekaramaana paiyan rajinikanth suddenly interrupts the movie with his sermons the worst being how women of yesteryears got their exercise through household work yet we are to believe that he is not a theist even though he was well read he wastes six of his seven powers on a stupid kite i can go on but you get the picture there are god men there are gods and there is rajinikanth the directory has difficulty fitting rajinikanth into one of these categories initially rajinikanth is just rajinikanth doing what tamil heroes do stand up to villains and in spite of being the oldest getting courted by the prettiest girl in the movie rajinikanth does this well and some of rajinikanth s trademark styles are actually enjoyable baba count is a novelty what makes this movie unbearable is that those few initial minutes are just a preface to an worst book to be ever written even that preface is punctuated with some comedy which are forced and obvious the director doesn t explain the purpose of the hero we see that the hero is facing several hurdles from politicians as usual but we can t really root for the hero because we don t know what the hero s ultimate goal is at the end when everyone wants him to be the leader the hero gives another one of his sermons and walks away to become a hermit the director offers no solution to the problem in the climax scene a r rehman s score is really interesting either he shows patches of brilliance or he didn t bother to invest himself fully into this movie who can blame him there is one scene where rajinikanth steps into the van of one of the crooks and then throws the knife and starts his baba count the music is very apt for the moment and acts as a catalyst adding further tension the songs are all mediocre no one would bother with the songs from this movie after a few years unfortunately is the lowest rank you can assign in imdb this movie has all the elements that justify its rightful place at the nether of imdb s ranking
i found the dvd version of this movie at a rummage sale the basic premise is an affair between a teacher coach a student the acting is weak and the plot razor thin this movie had all the depth and plot development of an adult film
i just saw dreamgirls yesterday and i was really underimpressed despite all the oscar buzz this is nothing special anyone who was really impressed by this film has never bothered to see any of the true movie musical classics except for eddie murphy s great musical and dramatic performance dreamgirls is just a glorified tv movie with no style or flair just a bunch of amateurs singing at each other now the first half hour was good but i was irritated at how eddie murphy s terrific raveup performances were truncated and interrupted by montages those were easily the best songs and best performances in the film and the rise to the top portion of the film was the only part of the film that had a consistent point of view or any momentum the remaining hour and minutes was a formless rambling mess that was neither realistic nor fantastic enough to be interesting it was also visually dull and included too many sound alike tunes condon didn t try to turn any of the tunes into big show pieces as i d expected they would each number in the nd half was just one closeup after another of people singing at each other and the way they shot hudson s big love me number was criminal condon just shot her stomping around the stage no drama at all god it sucked and note to all involved that sing talking dialog stuff might work on stage but it does not work in movies see embarrassing failures of evita and phantom all that i ll teeeell youuuu something efff ieeee crap should have been left on the editing room floor those aren t songs again the film except for eddie murphy s amazing performance was nothing more than a glorified tv movie there must have been megabucks behind the pr work for this film i wonder how much money was spent to give it that pre release one to beat oscar buzz as a whole this film was except for eddie nowhere near an oscar caliber movie except for eddie i d rank it right up there with grease big disappointment especially after all the very expen i ve hype
this british spanish co production is one of the countless films shot in spain in the wake of the unexpected phenomenal success enjoyed by the italian spaghetti westerns and as is typical of such genre efforts features an eclectic assortment of established and emerging international stars robert shaw telly savalas stella stevens martin landau fernando rey michael craig al lettieri dudley sutton antonio mayans etc ironically however this incoherent mess of a movie serves as a shining example as to why that most american of film genres became a dying breed in the s and is nowadays practically or is that officially extinct i really wanted to like this film not only because the western is one of my favorite types of movies but also because it had all the qualities including an intriguing premise to be a good one not to mention the fact that my father had purchased a paperback edition of a town called bastard s novelization following its original release as it is the film s sole virtue if indeed it can even be called that is its sheer eccentricity for instance stevens playing a widow out for revenge on the man who betrayed her revolutionary husband sleeps inside a coffin driven around in a carriage by her dumb manservant sutton savalas as a blood thirsty renegade who at first appears to be the film s main villain is unceremoniously dispatched by his own henchman lettieri very early on in the picture the villain of the piece then turns out to be landau who in the film s very first scene is seen pillaging side by side our legendary hero turned priest shaw fernando rey playing a blind peasant is the only one who can identify rebel shaw who in the end turns out to have been merely a front for well nevermind as you can see the plot is very confusing and it gets stranger from there the production team responsible for this film were also behind other western fare around the same period of time like custer of the west bad man s river captain apache and pancho villa
sure if you ask any mom who s the most beautiful baby in the world she d tell you her son is the most amazing kid in the whole world she s right at least in her own world the producers of the movie were biggie s mother and his good friend puffy oh well do i need to say more i ll break it down for those who doesn t want to do a simple deduction the whole movie was fake you may just put a few biggie s mtv video together and call it a movie the beautiful angela bassett played biggie s mother the real one in life looks like a dog i just wonder why he called himself biggie small big body small dick big mouth small sound big fat small eyes disclaimer i m a person of color so keep your racist remark to yourself
this film s trailer interested me enough to warrant renting the dvd however the resulting movie is absolutely dire admittedly this is not the worst film ever made or the worst film this year but it came damn close the main issue is the film not knowing what it wants to be comedy adult drama thriller teen porn the story is interesting as it deals with the pitfalls of mail order brides but the film is a mess what starts out as a mildly interesting comedy a word i use in the loosest possible terms then goes totally in reverse and degenerates into a very dark and distasteful misogynistic thriller nicole kidman should know better and ben chaplin is wasted as are matthieu kassovitz and vincent cassel whom i can only presume did this for the money this is a bad film in pretty much every single aspect it s not funny it s almost so sexist that you could almost forgive benny hill for everything he did and the dramatic elements are just downright nasty a film to be avoided unless you absolutely have to see kidman or chaplin in every one of their films
i usually like zombie movies but this one was just plain bad the good parts girl swimming topless with thong bottoms sonya salomaa s topless and ona grauer s boobs jiggling in a skimpy top when she ran the bad part too much video cuts too much matrix slow motion it drags the action not enough blood and guts bad acting and no story the only other person in the theater was smart and left right after the topless swimming scene a total waste of and time i give it a out of
after i got done watching this movie i was so upset that i had wasted hours of my life that s hours i ll never get back ugh when you start this you might think wow this is really good but rest assured that first impressions mean nothing i was so excited about this movie until the dumbest ending i have ever seen this movie is simply pathetic the acting is bland the story line is anything but original and there s nothing especially unique about this except that it s the worst movie ever do not watch this movie warning dumbest movie ever you will be sorry if you waste hours of your life on this
oh dear this movie could have been sub titled when writers go on strike what a stinker i had really high hopes for this mostly after reading imdb reviews which makes me wonder about the whole imdb rating system but that s a separate matter i loved steve carrell in anchorman bruce almighty the office etc so i was expecting great things to say i was disappointed is the understatement of the year there are so many things wrong with this movie but i ll confine myself to a the implausibility of any family behaving like these people do a mass aerobics workout what planet is that real life on the clunky script a murderer of love please and the fact that the character of dan is so unlikable you find yourself wondering what the girl saw in him to make her fall in love with him this movie was filled to bursting with clunky dialogue creaking direction ridiculous set scenes and it was slow slow slow we would have walked out after half an hour if we d not been with my parents who don t get out much and don t like to waste money unlike the makers of this movie who would have been better off throwing all the cash spent making this movie into a bonfire that would have been more entertaining if you like movies avoid this like the plague
tierney s an authentic tough guy but this movie misfire from normally competent rko undercuts his impact at every turn the script is about as plausible as oj simpson at a ten cmmandments dinner just count the times tierney s incredible car companions swallow one lame excuse after another for his evasive and violent acts the old clich about it only happening in the movies applies here in spades then there s the guy playing the watchman who appears to have wandered in from a boozy wc fields comedy ruining the menacing mood in the process the static one room sets don t help either and neither does director feist s obvious lack of feel for the material then add a final car chase missing both imagination and pay off and the results are pretty flat in fact the movie only picks up in the station house scenes where hard bitten cops discover the hidden powers of innocent looking gas station attendants too bad that tieney s career never really gelled i gather that was due largely to being as big a tough guy off screen as on and getting in one sleazy scrape after another his ice cold manner and clarity of emotion remind me at times of lee marvin at his tough guy best anyway this project might have worked as a radio play but as a movie with a promising noir title it s a disappointment
why do people who do not know what a particular time in the past was like feel the need to try to define that time for others replace woodstock with the civil war and the apollo moon landing with the titanic sinking and you ve got as realistic a flick as this formulaic soap opera populated entirely by low life trash is this what kids who were too young to be allowed to go to woodstock and who failed grade school composition do i ll show those old meanies i ll put out my own movie and prove that you don t have to know nuttin about your topic to still make money yeah we already know that the one thing watching this film did for me was to give me a little insight into underclass thinking the next time i see a slut in a bar who looks like diane lane i m running the other way it s child abuse to let parents that worthless raise kids it s audience abuse to simply stick woodstock and the moonlanding into a flick as if that ipso facto means the film portrays
luckily i did not pay to see this movie also i cannot even reveal any spoilers because i willingly walked out after forty minutes of the movie it was that bad i laughed once when the yahoo billboard fell on the guy and the theme song came on however that was only because i thought it was making fun of it but then i realized it was yet another product placement i loved the cartoon i used to watch it almost religiously although i missed the last episode i heard that they show dr claw and it was nothing more than a claw somebody comment on the show s page the cartoon had penny and brain alot more than the movie had as to that point i hated the setup of the whole thing reminiscent of robocop then broderick screws with the whole feeling of inspector gadget he is not nearly as clumsy as the cartoon was another fact is his gadgets actually work to the point i saw except for the oil slick he also screwed with the tone of wowsers which used to be in an excited tone i felt so disappointed that they slaughtered the cartoon so badly everybody else felt that way too us year olds remember the cartoon fondly and we loved every minute of it i went into the movie with an open mind knowing that they would have screwed with the cartoon i was taken aback at how retarded the movie was it relied on sight gags and stupid dialogue for humor disney relies on pain and physical humor to push a kids movie along product placement is pointless in this film and it shows the wise cracking car is not that good at cracking wise the gadgets look nice but they were almost overly glossy the cartoon was a better look the silly scenes were crap in the minutes i watched the movie not one laugh was heard and they laughed at the dudley do right preview this movie should not be watched by people who want intelligence in their family entertainment i highly recommend the iron giant which was sad but very very good this movie is a travesty to the whole family drama
the name of nick stahl the young cast and the attractive cover of the vhs made me buy and watch this flick expecting to see a good teen slash movie what a crap the full of clich s screenplay the dialogs and the performances are awful dreadful very bad terrible horrendous summarizing a complete waste of time there is no horror black humor only an absolutely boring story with shameful plot points the film begins with six characters indeed three couples together like a group of friends but indeed very nasty persons that seems to be enemies playing a ridiculous senseless game called taboo and with each one of them writing yes or no for certain taboo issues that is it no previous development of the characters the viewer does not know who they are their motives and relationship then there is an ellipsis to one year later and the same group is gathered together in a new years eve party insulting each other in a very sordid way but the plot and the twists are so ridiculous predictable mediocre and unbelievable that do not deserve any additional line in my review one advice only do not waste your time or money on this garbage you will certainly regret my vote is one awful title brazil taboo jogando com o assassino taboo playing with the killer
this movie will confuse you to death furthermore if your a denise richards fan don t even think of renting this movie besides getting top billing by being on the cover and about minutes of air time if that she has nothing to do with the movie or the many messed up plots
this is the worst movie i have ever seen the avengers held this dubious honor but no longer the acting in jill the ripper is terrible and was only eclipsed by the plot this movie is as intellectually stimulating as the telletubbes it doesn t know whether it wants to be an s m flick or a really bad thriller only watch under extreme intoxication or if you re bed ridden and need a leather clad distraction this script should be reworked into a porn it wouldn t take very much effort and would have a longer shelf life a porn even a bad porn wouldn t do the damage to dolf lundgren s career the way that this movie has
i was utterly disappointed by this movie i had read some of the other reviews here and had much higher expectations i expected a drama with more intense character development but that never happens in the movie daniel day lewis is a good actor but not as good as some reviewers here would have us believe i tought he repeated the same set of or movements in the movie i would rate his performance out of acting out of direction is out of script is the worst out of i deleted the movie from my dvr at mins into the movie much better movies out there than this
i was recently online looking at a site that featured public domain movies in their long list of films was this film and i thought i must be hallucinating at such an offensive title and premise but no that s really what it was and since the film was only about minutes long i decided to give it a try if it had turned out to be some porno movie i would have stopped watching instead it turned out to be the most bizarre film i have ever seen the danish production crew tried with a budget of about to make a star trek style film about a crew of very gay men traveling about the galaxy wiping out female oppression by killing all the women like they proceeded to do on the earth and in every case they were met with cheers and thanks from the now gay men of the planet subtle this ain t with some of the most obscene and juvenile names of characters i ve ever heard i don t even think i can write them on imdb without having my review removed however despite the utter crappiness of it all it was strangely watchable and worth a peek but as i mentioned already due to the crude names and odd subject matter though no nudity it s a film for adults only by the way this movie left me with questions as to who would make this why make it and who was the intended audience it may not be the absolute worst thing i have ever seen but it probably is the weirdest and possibly the most offensive
let me tell you something about this movie i have seen it twice the first time i was a kid and the movie was quite entertaining to me i really liked it i thought it was funny and interesting and the main character was kind of cool i saw it again a few days ago it was horrible really i don t know why i thought it was funny before but now i didn t laugh at all there was nothing even slightly entertaining it was just dumb the story was weak the acting was nothing special there are great actors in this movie but still the acting is mediocre at best what is the worst is the fact that this movie is racist really don t get me wrong usually i don t complain about racism in movies however i have seen people complaining about the lack of black men in movies like the shaolin temple or about the fact that the only black man in the street fighter is one of the bad guys or whatever you get the point there are people seeing racism everywhere i wonder how would they react to a movie like the meteor man why i will tell you why there are no asians in this movie there are no white people among the good guys in fact there is only one white guy in the entire movie and he is the leader of the bad guys all the good guys are african americans don t get me wrong i don t care is the good guy is black or white or yellow or pink or green what i do care about is the fact that we can barely see a white person in this movie this is the only movie like that that i have ever seen it is just not realistic if there is only one black man in a japanese movie which is the case with the street fighter there is no problem in japan most of the people are asians but if there is only one white man in an american movie there is some sort of problem in usa most of the people are white it is like filming a japanese movie with entirely white cast and only one asian as a bad guy just not real that is it i am giving the movie the rate of it would be if i hadn t have fun with it as a kid
no comment stupid movie acting average or worse screenplay no sense at all skip it
start with the script i have seen cartoons with more depth than envy anytime characters keep repeating what you have already seen and was not funny the first time a movie is in deep trouble which envy certainly is a movie that relies on one joke had better have somewhere to go with it here we have a film that goes absolutely nowhere christopher walken especially would like to forget this bomb because his character is so weak ben stiller has been in some pretty good black comedies flirting with disaster and duplex immediately come to mind be certain that envy is not a black comedy there are no double meanings just total nonsense envy deserves it s low rating because like it s subject matter it stinks merk
i have not seen the first film and if it anything like this have no great desire to having just watched it a few hours ago i am struggling to remember a thing about it from what i remember it s main plot seems to be a group of very annoying people stay at a house with that dodgy old woman from friday the th and are stalked by plank of wood man some people die the film ends i am starting a law suit against the person who sold me this film as i want compensation for the missing time in my life i will pay u to take this film off my hands oh wait i already gave it away to a friend
it was difficult to sit through this horrible heretical adaptation of sherlock holmes apparently matt frewer was cast because he is tall and skinny his skull like face made for a good zombie in the dawn of the dead remake but as sherlock holmes he looks like a scarecrow not only does frewer have a lanky lackadaisical walk that is hard to watch but he looks uncomfortable in the stereotypical holmes overcoats that he is wearing not only that but while the coat is gray twill they apparently could not find a matching cap so his cap is black and it looks shiny as if it were made of polyester whatever the cap was made of it looked very new and artificial jeremy brett occasionally wore those traditional outfits but brett did not have to dress up like sherlock holmes in order to look the part frewer on the other hand is painful to watch even in the full holmes outfit he does not carry himself like sherlock holmes frewer s cadaverous face grinning all the time as he spouts on and on in a very bad upper crust british accent is painful to see and listen to to say that frewer is overacting is an understatement after he finishes each sentence with some kind of nasal hum he then sneers as if that were some kind of british trait when i started watching this i thought it might be a comedy featuring wishbone the jack russell terrier i thought frewer had been cast as some kind of foil for wishbone but sadly there is no dog in this movie except for frewer wishbone would have made this movie a lot better not only does frewer s version of sherlock holmes never stop talking in that awfully artificial british nasal accent but he is much to friendly and kind frewer is always smiling at the witnesses he talks to and he is so polite and courteous that he could be teaching at a charm school instead of being a sleuth perhaps since this is a hallmark channel production they are trying to make a children s version of sherlock holmes wishbone was better at that too that was kindler and gentler whatever the point of frewer s interpretation of sherlock holmes it is flatter than a pancake and easily the worst version of sherlock holmes that i have ever seen including the previous worst by charlton heston overall the tone of this film is awful it reminded me of a typical episode of barnaby jones or murder she wrote or diagnosis murder all the suspects over acted suspiciously and glared at the victims before they were killed holmes and watson are explaining every clue to each other during the entire movie even on murder she wrote there is less exposition this sherlock holmes does not even compare very well to jim rockford of the rockford files and it is miles below columbo the awful dialog is probably the fault of the writer it is obvious that who ever wrote this script has very little familiarity with sherlock holmes especially the bbc version with jeremy brett this movie has all of the atmosphere of an episode of little house on the prairie the fact that the actors seem to be smirking when they enunciate their lines in their fake accents does not help the only minor bright spot is ken walsh who plays doctor watson with some dignity walsh does not ham it up compared to frewer and when he is often interviewing witnesses his demeanor and conversational style are much more natural and credible unfortunately the rest of the cast is amateurish and the visual clues they give by glaring and making faces at each other to show they are suspicious is something that i had not seen in any modern movie
this is just plain bad sometimes remakes even if they stray from the original are good on their own they can bring another viewpoint and achieve a certain interpretation that makes them unique and enjoyable this was as poorly thought out and carried out as can be this wasn t any good even standing on it s own viggo mortenson is a top notch actor but some of his selections of roles and projects leaves something to be desired the original vanishing point was such a thrilling psychological adventure this is not an adventure at all and is not enjoyable or entertaining whatsoever this was made from a by the numbers approach to film making stuffing in plot points that someone in hollywood believes will please what they see as today s film going audience basically they see us as a bunch of idiots it s insulting that someone will put this out as a feature film and even attempt to remake a cult classic this sloppily the manipulative plot devices the make it obvious so they don t miss the point aspects ridiculous dialogue stereotyped characters amateurish direction this is plain bad
i just finished dark chamber aka under surveillance and i m stunned stunned not by the film but by some of the rave reviews i perused which influenced my watching it the story was so ravaged by plot holes and the majority of the acting so flat categorizing it as a comedy seems appropriate seriously i found myself shaking my head and laughing in bewilderment as i endured this movie justin leaves the confines of living at home with a pain killer addicted mom to go live with his cop father despite mom s warnings that dad is no good when a young woman is found murdered justin becomes suspicious of the tenants who reside in the adjacent apartments with the help of a couple pals he installs covert cameras to keep tabs on these folks as the truth begins to unravel justin uncovers an unexpected secret one positive point is that felissa rose is hot i would have generously slapped an extra star or two on here had she peeled down a bit but no such luck it would have been the film s potential saving grace eric conley played justin very adeptly i thought and i wouldn t be surprised whatsoever to see more of him in the future the general premise of the film although plagued by clich s might possibly have worked had it not been for the ridiculously hollow performances of key cast members most notably alexandra eitel kayla and david h rigg justin s father the horror pardon the pun i have nothing against low budget films indeed i believe independent film is our only hope for decent film making in the days to come i ll cut low budget films quite a bit of slack when it comes to special effects lighting even musical score and the overall picture quality i don t give allowances however for stick figure acting and a swiss cheese lover s script there are a vast number of competently made low budget films out there sadly this isn t one of them i can t help but suspect that at least a few of the reviewers who have praised dark chamber here are in some way affiliated with its production
this is one of the worst films ever i like cheesy movies but this is simply awful where are the images in the film that are on the box i think more money was spent on the dvd box illustrations than on the entire film why would a company release a dvd that the cover is so misleading i feel like such an idiot for renting this movie based strictly on the box as much as i explore imdb i should have done a little research and made a list prior to visiting my local video rental store i have no one to blame except myself i want my money and time back do not watch this movie even if curiosity is motivating you stick cocktail umbrellas in your eyes instead it will be much more enjoyable you have been warned
this is a sad film made for sad people i was sitting in theaters tearing my hair apart wanting to break the chairs in front of me as the movie spitted out one cringe inducing scenes after another and there were people roaring with laughter behind me which made me wonder what kind of films these people must be watching to actually enjoy this horse s t nikkhil advani has six stories with no plot and no interesting characters the screenplay is dull probably he was drunk when he was writing this film there is no strong hold on any of these stories nothing new nothing to hold the audience and filled with dialogs which you would have heard a million times before one of the stories is about this couple not being able to have sex because of series of disasters taking place every time they want to do it i mean seriously is this story really required its not funny not creative but only proves that advani has no sense of comedy another of the stories which was probably the only story i was interested in is based on a man s infidelity and that too ends in a lame age old sati savitri pati parmeshwar crap i have no idea what the salmaan priyanka plot was all about there was no issue in the plot for it to be a plot she can t take karan johar s film because she has to marry salmaan why can t she marry him and still take the film or does advani and priyanaka just want to prove the world that it is in fact true that female actors cant be successful if they are married or that they should not act in films once they are married with six actors in the film obviously advani cant produce the film all by himself so he makes full use of sponsors like the times group shamelessly promoting their filmfare magazines and also some jewelery brand which the women in the film absolutely seem to adore i come to imdb to give it the worst rating and i am shocked to see posts praising the film it just goes to show the sad state of bollywood and how star struck the fans are with fans like these movies like salaam e ishq will be continue to be made and worse probably be a hit
it was so terrible it wasn t fun to watch at all even the scene where the girl is using a vibrator even that s not fun to watch in this movie i say again the scene where a girl is masturbating with a vibrator is not even fun to watch or maybe if that was the only part of the movie that you watched just girl on couch using a vibrator maybe they should have just released that one scene in theaters maybe then the movie would be enjoyable on a certain level my advice fast forward to that point watch it rewind the movie watch it again rewind repeat maybe you could enjoy yourself for hours that way this movie ranks alongside i spit on your grave and doom generation in the category of worst movies that i have ever seen
well i ll start with the good points the movie was only minutes long and some of it was so bad it was funny now for the low points my first warning sign came with an actual warning on the film when it started the following warning was displayed the film you are about to see contains graphic and disturbing images because contrary to popular belief being killed is neither fun pretty or romantic i should have saved myself the minutes and turned it off then the first words of the film were i m at the glue factory it was some guy talking on his phone and he was referring to a nursing home as a glue factory i don t know why so the basis of the movie is some kid is obsessed with the zodiac killer and starts imitating him the budget for this film was at least bucks and they must have used the cheapest cameras they could find the acting was worse than me reading straight from a script that s what is looked like they were doing the script was horrible and the big twist was that this guy who wrote a biography on the zodiac killer was actually the zodiac killer of course they tried to show this subtly but made it totally obvious within the first minutes without any more painful details of the plot here were some horrible highlights of the movie they try to make the zodiac killer compare himself to an army of one because soldiers are really just murderers then they tried to make an attempt at satanic worship by showing some guys in black hoods in a meeting the great computer hacker was able to get this kid s address when someone gave him the kid s name and phone number for some reason he had to hack into the fbi to get someone address i m not sure why he didn t just look it up in the phone book or use whitepages com there was also a random allusion to for no reason i also learned that no matter where you get shot blood will come out of your mouth within seconds so if you like really bad acting sub par scripts bad camera work and an obvious plot you ll love zodiac killer
something i really love about this woman s short films was the elusiveness of theme especially in living with happiness this film has some nice beginnings unusual location and the potential for a strange cinematic treatment but fails to succeed with clunky expositional dialogue patchy performances and very television coverage it s once again charming television and very ordinary cinema the ideas are so fleshed out that they almost feel pat like a television commercial but the sentiment is good so we can t complain too much i really would love to see this director make a full length animation and try and work with a producer who doesn t demand so much boring clarity
this movie had a fairly good sounding plot but the paste was very slow very slow indeed even if someone thinks this is a cult classic i think that there are a lot better films from that era to be watched the cinematography is not excellent but not the worst either the sounds are ok lighting ok i still wouldn t recommend this to anyone else than maybe a film student the movie does not contain music and the horses having sex don t make it a good one either and the woman masturbating on the edge of the bed was plain stupid no winnings here skip this utter boredom i ve seen worse believe me but this is just waste of time and i don t get the good reviews here especially the high ratings
i m still trying to figure out if there was a point to this film for content that s supposed to be so rebellious and controversial the things that maddox distributes to the students are awfully lame students seem to be easily swayed by vague anti authoritarian sentiments and snippets of words illegibly scrawled onto leaflets rebel everybody i suppose it would have been too much to ask to have a teenage rebellion film where a school fire alarm doesn t get set off apparently a huge fight up on the football fields is a fight that consists of two people characters personalities seem to wildly vary at random a football jock who maddox was fighting and who subsequently got a staple on the face is all smiles and apologies the next day the fact that it doesn t come to any real conclusion of the plot makes me feel that the whole thing could have been fitted into a half hour after school special if they had cut most of the attempted pseudo glitch soundtrack
here s why the jane show won t work once again canadian bonehead producers and writers can t create a sitcom without putting some kind of different spin on it i guess these people don t watch a lot of t v from the u s which has the sitcom model down pat no here we have to do something different we have to make the a story absolutely absurd and then have a meaningful b story to try to make up for it the characters are two dimensional and the story lines are way over the top forklift races give me freaking break here s a little advice for the writers of the show don t write funny situations find the funny in situations and remember you have to be born with a sense of humor to write truly funny stuff not just be an improv monkey
what do you call a horror story without horror and story this is the most irritating thing about the film i get the feeling the writers never really decided what s actually going on in the film it s a different thing to know it give hints for the audience and not completely reveal it but here you get the feeling the screenwriters don t know it characters in the film do not know it and audience sees that no one knows remember cube even that film knew more about itself i ve consumed a lot of s horror gore films and this movie certainly has its roots deep in those films but a lot of important things are missing we really know nothing about the characters they keep repeating empty lines over and over again the story isn t really developing it never goes anywhere b acting is ok in this type of horror films but there s not much to act in the script we don t care about the characters there s nothing to remember about them there s not even cheesy humor or unnecessary sex and most importantly no thrills no chills you only get some commonly used elements of the horror film genre they show the lordi monsters one by one but their characters don t really contribute anything for the story i honestly believe that this amount of story character development and atmosphere could be achieved with minimal amount of crew and equipment oh yeah film makers used to do that and more some years ago i felt the shared embarrassment of the audience as the film ended too bad really
they probably should have called this movie the map because the majority of the whole stupid film is revolved around a map of a cemetery not to mention how many of the same boring shots of the map there are the only thing they show more than the map itself is the little beads of sweat that is constantly building up on the forehead of our main character this of course was the film makers way of showing us how incredibly tense things are getting up on the immortal hills cemetery come on now couldn t they have shown us just one of the death scenes we hear a whole lot about how everyone who is listed on the map is dropping like flies but we don t get to see anything some how i bury the living manged to keep my attention so i was fairly generous with the rating i gave it but i will not recommend this movie to anyone unless you have a deep fascination with maps or sweat i recommend renting a better i movie such as i spit on your grave or i drink your blood
to be a buster keaton fan is to have your heart broken on a regular basis most of us first encounter keaton in one of the brilliant feature films from his great period of independent production the general the navigator sherlock jnr we recognise him as the greatest figure in the entire history of film comedy and we want to see more of his movies here the heartbreak begins after steamboat bill jnr keaton s brother in law joseph schenck pressured him into signing a contract that put keaton under the control of mgm keaton became just one more actor for hire performing someone else s scripts then his alcoholism got worse after steamboat bill jnr keaton never again made a truly first rate film a couple of sources describe a would be masterpiece comedy that keaton claimed he almost got to make at mgm a parody of grand hotel biographer tom dardis has offered convincing evidence that keaton made up this story the heartbreak increases because among the many years of keaton s long steady decline he just occasionally came up with a good film such as his short comedy grand slam opera i continue to search for the lost footage of keaton s dramatic scene with spencer tracy in it s a mad mad world a sequence in which embittered cop tracy telephones an old retired crook keaton and tries to recruit his assistance in stealing smiler grogan s cash that footage is almost certainly gone forever but i keep looking speak easily alas is one of keaton s films from the beginning of his decline mgm were trying to build up jimmy durante who coincidentally played smiler grogan three decades later as a new comedy star unfortunately mgm tried to build up durante by teaming him with keaton whose style of comedy was simply incompatible with durante s i m a fan of both throughout his career durante was a merciless scene stealer commendably he knew that he was being built up at keaton s expense and keaton was the only co star whom durante never attempted to upstage keaton was often cast as the victim of extremely cruel machinations in speak easily he plays a didactic and humourless midwestern college professor named post because he s as wooden as one who receives a letter informing him that he s inherited which he must travel to new york city to claim does he make a phone call to verify this does he even check the postmark no he takes his life s savings out of the bank and rushes to new york as soon as he s gone post s manservant confesses that he wrote the fake letter to jostle professor post out of his rut post who thinks he s a millionaire crosses paths with jimmy dodge durante who s trying to produce a musical revue but hasn t any money the characters which these two brilliant comedians are playing onscreen simply fail to intermesh keaton is playing one of those eggheads like mister logic in viz who intellectualises everything durante plays one of those annoying hepcats who is incapable of making any straightforward statement because the script requires him always to speak in slang there s a painfully unfunny dialogue scene in which durante is trying to talk to keaton about money but instead of coming straight out with it durante has to use increasingly contrived slang terms like kale cartwheels and so forth while keaton of course has no idea what durante s on about i ll give keaton credit his own dry and dusty prairie voice his flat kansas accent is absolutely perfect for the character he s playing here sidney toler looking much leaner and more handsome here than he would be just a year later is impressive as the excitable director of the revue bankrolled on tick by professor post henry armetta whom i ve never found funny is even less funny than usual here offering a running gag with a stupid payoff thelma todd impressed me here in a more villainous version of the role she played in horse feathers a much funnier movie edward brophy one of my favourite character actors is wasted part of the problem with speak easily is that supporting characters behave in completely inappropriate ways keaton s lawyer shows up at durante s theatre with an urgent message for keaton but he isn t there so the lawyer proceeds to divulge keaton s personal business to the first total stranger he meets fire that lawyer buster in another scene professor post the guy who s perceived as bankrolling this musical blunders into the chorus girls changing room and all the chorus girls immediately squeal and cover themselves i know for a fact that modern chorus girls would never react this way and i seriously doubt that chorus girls in behaved that way either certainly not in response to the angel controlling their show s pursestrings spoilers coming about half an hour into the unfunny speak easily the great jimmy durante seats himself at the piano grins into the camera and does that distinctive little shake of his head as he starts to play a tune this is the moment when i thought that at long last this movie was finally going to settle down to its purpose of entertaining us alas no most annoying of all is the ending of this film which uses the single most hackneyed and implausible cliche in all of comedy the one in which an utterly incompetent dimwit becomes a star comedian through his own ineptitude keaton would be forced to replay this cliche in a episode of screen directors playhouse chaplin had already used it in the circus i very nearly wept in anger and sorrow at the wasted opportunities in speak easily mostly out of respect for the work that keaton durante toler brophy and miss todd have done elsewhere i ll rate this movie points out of
i was one of those few americans that grew up with all of gerry andersen s marvelous creations thunderbirds was a great series for the time and would have made a great action adventure movie if only the writers could have figured out where to target it i expected it to be a romp but i did not expect it to aim at such a low age group like lost in space this could have been both visually stunning and exciting it should have focused on more action adventure and the goal of the original series saving people in trouble instead it focused on alan saving the day instead of his brothers who were cast too young anyway vs the original the breakout part was lady penelope and parker i didn t care too much for the characters in the original but i was grateful for them in the movie they stole the show i always enjoyed thunderbirds more for the high tech than the stories and even that did not get enough screen time as far as i was concerned i would have enjoyed seeing more of the cool gadgets but then i m just a big kid
visually disjointed and full of itself the director apparently chose to seek faux depth to expand a minute plot into an minute snore fest the moments that work in this film are very limited and the characters don t even feel real how could you feel invested in a main protagonist who was made so surreal substantively and stylistically it all feels like a quirky dream sequence jarring irregular camera work awkward silences and gaps in action and what s with the little spider image crawling across the screen whoever thought of that needs to go back to film school it added no meaning just cheese and didn t even stylistically work with the rest of the film assuming the film even had a style which is a close call what a flop
this movie had more holes than a piece of swiss cheese ben affleck was seriously not trying to act in any way shape or form he outright sucked nothing about the movie was believable the first problems were in the intro where the man gives everything of value to the salvation army santa claus but it doesn t show why and then the granny sticks her head in the oven really beautiful and has absolutely nothing to do with the movie it s not even in the same tone as the movie there was no explanation of the motivation for ben affleck to choose the house he chose there was not any believable reactions by the family he chose and people are swayed here and there without any cause to be swayed example christina applegate and ben affleck s characters go tobogganing down a steep slope this is the incident that makes her suddenly fall in love with him riiiight anyway there was a funny moment or two but they were a rarity in the movie it seriously needed another rewrite or hope you enjoy
steve mcqueen has certainly a lot of loyal fans out there he certainly was a charismatic fellow one of the most charismatic the big screen ever knew but even mcqueen can t save this turkey of a film shot with what looks like a brownie camera in the actual locations in st louis mcqueen s a new kid with no criminal record brought into the planning of a bank heist by one of the other gang there s more than a broad hint that there s a gay relationship going on between young steve and david clarke he s not liked at all by the other heist members mainly because of his lack of criminal resume steve also has a girl friend in molly mccarthy and she suspects something afoot especially when he starts hanging around with crahan denton and james dukas as well as clarke all pretty rough characters that would certainly get my suspicions aroused the great st louis bank robbery had two directors charles guggenheim and john stix guggenheim did mostly documentaries and stix didn t do much of anything one of those two jokers decided steve s performance was best served by doing a bad marlon brando imitation this film may go down as the worst ever done by steve mcqueen i m willing to bet that dick powell and four star productions had already signed him for wanted dead or alive because i can t believe they would have if they saw this or they would have seen something the public would have overlooked except for the dressing for this turkey
sometimes you wonder how some people get funding to create a movie as bad as this one you can only stand about minutes of this utter piece of garbage before you stomp back into blockbuster and demand your money back i will now look at michael clarke duncan with apprehension why he lent his name to this vermin
i am a student of film and have been for several years and the concept of a cyber kung fu satirical chimpanzee had me wondering is this the film that s going to break the mold let s face it america has never been let down by any piece of cinema that features a simian costar after such great classics as monkey trouble and dunston checks in i thought that the best ideas were already taken but then comes funky monkey i laughed i cried i contemplated suicide now i ve read about demon possession in the bible but that still doesn t explain why someone would create such a product of evil first off having at least a shred of intelligence i realized that a chimpanzee was in fact an ape not a monkey at all however i was sure that the filmmakers would clear this problem up further into the film they didn t let me sum up this work of art a company by the name of z i t has decided to train chimpanzees as soldiers why i think they mention something about the soldiers working for bananas but when it would cost about an estimated million dollars of government money to train one chimp this doesn t seem cost effective well anyways z i t brings in a cia specialist matthew modine to train clemens the chimp clemens is everything z i t hoped for he can take out an entire shift of guards who all appear to have gotten their training skills at the local mall and yet still manage to remind us that we re watching a kid s movie as you may have guessed modine finds out that z i t s intentions may be evil gasp and decides to break clemens out being a cia agent and all modine knows that best way to make himself disappear is to go to a large city rent a guest room regularly make appearances on television while fighting crime and using checks to pay for everything z i t finds out where modine is staying and sends two of their finest to retrieve him these guards are possibly the greatest comedy team up since martin and lewis or was it turner and hooch it doesn t matter anyways because in the end for a heck of a twist ending the good guys win yay hooray for predictability throw in a nerdy kid who learns to be himself a lonely mom who needs a date and music montages that feature songs that would even be blackballed by radio disney and you get funky monkey the climax to the movie a football game played by thugs bumblers a chimp and the nerd boy no one seems to care about such substitutions at a high school football game funky monkey never lets up it s edge of your seat entertainment some might even call this the american beauty of monkey filled features after finishing this epic i recalled hearing a story about a railroad worker who lost much of his brain functions when a metal rod pierced his temporal lobe funky monkey is a metal rod among movies
unimaginably stupid redundant and humiliating closure to the nightmare on elm street series part is so incompetent that it looks like director rachel talalay intentionally wanted to turn wes craven s initial premise into one big bad and tasteless joke this isn t just the worst entry in the elm street saga it s also one of the most embarrassing horror movies ever made and it downright offends fans of the genre the story is dumb the character drawings are ridiculous the structure is all murky and most of all the special and visual effects resemble those of a tom jerry cartoon the sequences in which freddy krueger murders his victims are endless and very uninteresting were we supposed to be petrified when a jabbering freddy turned breckin meyer into a video game character and pogo sticked him around the walls of a house the story takes us back to springwood and it appears that freddy all of a sudden has a middle aged daughter you d think he would mention that in one of his previous adventures but no there s only one teenage survivor in springwood and krueger uses him to get into contact with his long lost daughter another reason why this final installment is so awful is the completely illogical structure the john doe boy is introduced as the leading character but then all of a sudden he dies and the plot continues to revolve on two adults how about that freddy krueger who spent five entire films killing nothing but teenagers eventually gets beaten by two adults wearing d glasses sort of like ruins the whole essence doesn t it as far as i m concerned nightmare on elm street has always been a dreadfully overrated series but up until now even the weakest entries had at least some redeeming elements freddy s dead however is simply unendurable and nobody should waste his her precious time watching it
it seems like more consideration has gone into the imdb reviews of this film than went into the source here s a review without pretensions just when you think nothing is going to happen it doesn t dress it up any way you like this is a dull film full of unengaging characters doing very little of interest one to put on if you want to convince an impressionable emo chick that you re like so deep man not something to watch for your own pleasure though unless you re pretentious
i don t believe they made this film completely unnecessary the first film was okay but there was no need for a sequel certainly not after a television series that was already a sequel to the first film this film feels like a soap opera the writing is so bad it s utterly simple the jokes don t come across the acting is flat it s shot like a soap it lacks any direction the first film had a good emotional spine behind it every character had a little arc it was very simple then but somehow it worked and i could see the merit of that film but this time around there is no cohesive story line the characters are dull stereotypes and nothing interesting happens one good thing the brazilian boy who plays axel daeseleire s son is pretty well cast that was their one moment of creative success on this film i hear they already shot a second television series as a sequel to team spirit but please god don t let them make a third feature installment
guy is a loser can t get girls needs to build up is picked on by stronger more successful guys etc seen it saw it moved on i d have to say that rob needs to move past the adam sandler part of his life and get out of the adam sandler plots there are two funny parts in the whole movie i couldn t even finish the last minutes i was getting bored the animal is an alright film i do usually enjoy adam sandler films that have the same plot but this was trying too hard to impress the jokes are very old so trust me this is not a film that most people could really get into but some did so i ll be nice
this minute documentary bu uel made in the early s about one of spain s poorest regions is in my opinion one of his weakest films first let s admit that years later spain is much richer than it was then and when i say this i fully admit that wealth can bring problems of its own like excessive individualism and consumerism though all in all wealth it s a far better condition than the extreme poverty portrayed here and if poverty receded in spain it was not exactly with the sort of socialism that bu uel favored but with western european style capitalism but one of the most shocking things about the movie is this in one scene the narrator chides that in school children are taught the value of pi teaching math to poor people the horror bu uel shortsightedness is at its most glaring here not realizing that it is access to the latest knowledge and technology what will help the poor overcome their situation what is he proposing that children are taught exactly what at school doesn t bu uel understand that it is the lack of modern technology that has made them poor in comparison with other people
