el mar directed by catalonian director agusti villarona and based on the novel by blai bonet offers a glimpse of the spanish history as seen by a balearic author that takes the viewer back to the days of the civil war in that country the movie concentrates on three friends and follows them from those early days during the onset of the war in majorca to a few years later as two of those friends meet again when they are at a sanatorium lost in the countryside we first meet three boys that are playing happily not everything is what it seems the tragic death of one of them points out about the cruelty of the one that commits the evil deed the boys have excluded a young girl about their age from taking part in their games when we meet the adult ramallo again he is on his way to a sanatorium he seems to be suffering from tuberculosis to his surprise manuel tur one of his boyhood friends is also being treated and the young girl that was not welcomed to participate in their games is now one of the nuns that supervise their health care it is obvious that tur looks at ramallo in a way that only means he is in love with the tough bully their relationship will have devastating consequences roger casamajor does a good job with portraying the older ramallo bruno bergonzino makes an impression as tur the vulnerable youth antonia torrens plays sor francisca with conviction angela molina puts an appearance as carmen the wife of the caretaker of the institution simon andreu is perfect as alcantara el mar is a dark film that clearly shows agusti villarona s talents in making the novel come alive for the viewer
this early version of the tale the student of prague was made in germany in starring paul wegener who was also in the golem a few years later in this film he plays a dual role technically impressive for a year old film to see them in the same shot after meeting a mysterious old man who makes a pact with him for gold the gold he needs to woo a countess he s previously saved from drowning moving at a fast pace the film runs just over an hour and fairly well written and characterised the student of prague has echoes of the faust legend as well as dr jekyll and mr hyde starting as it does with a pact with a mysterious figure of potential evil and developing into good and evil sides of the same person
a serious comedy ross hunter produced movie version of the french play les joies de la famille later americanized as a very rich woman is plush well cast occasionally funny and unfortunately timeless a wealthy california widow who appears to be frittering away her money is railroaded by her two grown greedy daughters both of whom are afraid mama rosie is carelessly spending their inheritance the whole issue of a vital but aged woman sent to a rest home against her will and later having to prove herself sane in a court hearing is touchy material for a comedy and to his credit director david lowell rich doesn t overload the picture with crass gags or obvious sentiment some of the humor is a little broad and doesn t work yet rosalind russell understands the gravity inherent in this scenario and never hits a false note sandra dee is also good as rosalind s granddaughter and james farentino is very charming as a young lawyer the movie has so much to say about the importance of our elderly and the ways in which they choose to spend their remaining time that the seriousness of rosie s theme almost gets lost in the rush to a happy ending the picture leaves you smiling and at the same time wondering how many older ladies there are who were never quite so lucky from
the jokes are obvious the gags are corny and the characters are walking characatures but i couldn t stop from laughing at his highly entertaining movie no matter how many times i see it i still get a kick out of this one and i recommend it highly for all lovers of mindless entertainment it contains many quotable moments and some of the best sight gags i ve seen to this day if you ve had a bad week and you need a chuckle rent this one on your way home friday night to give your weekend a good start
it appears even the director doesn t like this film but for me i think he s being a bit harsh on himself sure it s not perfect but there are some atmospheric shots and the story is good enough to keep you interested throughout it s shot in what appears to be quite a pretty village which adds to the atmosphere as well if you like horror films shot in england give it a go i have just seen a trailer for this directors latest film the devil s chair which looks quite amazing there aren t enough english horror films for me so any that come along deserve our attention and this one isn t as bad as you may think
have you ever felt like your being watched like someone keeps tabs on every move you make well just remember before you decide to break the law the fbi will always be there at least that s the feeling you get after watching the gripping but slightly mellow crime drama the fbi story it traces the roots of the organization from a small bureau to one of the most modern facilities in the world in by telling the story through they eyes of one of its agents chip hardesty james stewart chip was with the fbi from day one and he gladly puts his job above everything else in the world even occasionally his family the fbi story tracks his life by depicting what he does as an agent and how being one affects his personal life the film does a spectacular job of showing what kind of cases the fbi handles and how they handle them the audience gets to see chip stop ku klux klan riots go undercover to solve an indian murder estate scandal bring fugitives into custody rescue hostages and helped fight in wwii he even helped bring communist spies to justice stewart in a vaguely complex performance is stellar as always as the slightly neurotic agent who loves his job maybe a little too much one of the best parts about this film is that we get to see the inside workings of both chip s family life and his job we witness him suffer through the death of his best friend and then his son we also observe his wife having a miscarriage and his marriage having rocky times almost all of his personal problems are caused by love of his job vera miles gives a spotty performance but it s very convincing none the less she was never a brilliant actress but there was always something very attractive and alluring about her well maybe that s just me sadly none of the other performances are worth mentioning but the attention grabbing story managed to keep me exceedingly interested the cinematography of this film was impressive especially the scenes in the south american jungles the colors all had a texture that really set the atmosphere of the film perhaps the greatest part of this movie was mervyn leroy s fabulous direction every scene was so fluid they just rolled together to tell a brilliant story it s chock full of ingenious camera shots some with a very hitchcockian feel all in all the fbi story is a spectacular but overlooked film clocking in at two and a half hours some viewers might be intimidated but if you get the chance i recommend jumping into this one i enjoyed jimmy stewart s spectacular performance and the captivating story
i m one of those people who usually watch programs and keep my feelings about a show private however pushing daisies is my exception i became curious about the program from the commercials that aired which gave glimpses of the premise of the show i was skeptical about it at first especially after the finale of six feet under was still in my head here we go again i thought i watched the first second third and all the other episodes wow first of all i thought it took the subject of death and presented in a way that was palatable without being morbid the characters were engaging and i like the thought of ned the main character not being able to literally touch the love of his life chuck without the consequences of her dying most of the characters have a longing for things they can t have besides ned and chuck olive longs for ned lily and vivian longs for their niece chuck and emerson is always longing for the monetary rewards from the mysterious deaths they solve i think the characters are picture perfect and believable i like how emerson who is black plays off of the rest of the characters since as an african american i like the subtle cultural humor that sometimes comes from him all in all this visual fairytale is one of the most valuable pieces of entertainment that i ve seen out of the season i think the show has enough romance for the romantics and enough who done it for the mystery buffs i just wish the writers would get back to work so that the show can continue to evolve
in iran women are prohibited from attending live sporting events because of the fear that they will be corrupted by bad language close proximity to thousands of men and the fact that there are no toilet facilities for women in the antiquated stadiums based on an actual incident involving the daughter of the director jafar panahi s offside follows six girls disguised as men who are refused entry into the soccer match in between iran and bahrain a match that will decide whether or not iran goes to the world cup in a departure from the bleak minimalist films we have been accustomed to from iran over the last ten years offside is an exuberant comedy that has a patriotic fervor and a universal appeal but contains enough subversive social commentary to warrant its prohibition from screenings in iran shot with a digital camera using non professional actors who are more than up to the task the girls try to sneak into azadi stadium in tehran but are arrested and placed in a holding area outside of the stadium they are guarded by three young army conscripts safdar samandar mohammed kheir abadi and masoud kheymeh kaboud who express ambivalence about their task but are pledged to follow the rules the women are soccer enthusiasts not political activists and cheer for iran s victory but this does not deter the soldiers from detaining them while they wait for the girls to be transported to the vice squad and an uncertain future outspoken rather than acting like victims they continually question the soldiers about the rationale behind the restrictions making their absurdity quite obvious although they can hear the crowd noise the women cannot see the action but achieve a minor victory when they persuade one of the soldiers to provide a running commentary on the game one of the funniest sequences takes place when a female prisoner is escorted to the men s room by a soldier the young recruit then must cope with a near riot when he has to prevent anyone else from using the facilities while the girl is still inside little by little to paraphrase adlai stevenson that which unites them turns out to be greater than that which divides them and the unlikely antagonists rally behind their country and root for the victory that will send iran to the world cup although the point is made early and often and the film sags a bit in the middle offside makes a telling point about a society where a political elite with a medieval social mentality has to contend with an growing group of educated and politically astute citizens one can only hope that world pressure and the awakening of its own people will force the ayatollahs to come to terms with the st century
this is a great movie to see with your girlfriend my friend and i both love dance and ran into this movie at the video store we had to get it with no violence and such a warming story its a great movie to relax to and just enjoy your night i would recommend this movie to any family or just a bunch of girls looking for a cute movie
okay the recent history of star trek has not been good the next generation faded in its last few seasons ds boldly stayed where no one had stayed before and voyager started very bad and never really lived up to its promise so when they announced a new star trek series i did not have high expectations and the first episode broken bow did have some problems but overall it was solid trek material and a good romp i ll get the nits out of the way first the opening theme is dull and i don t look forward to sitting through it regularly but that s what remotes are for what was really bad was the completely gratuitous lotion rubbing scene that just about drove my wife out of the room they need to cut that nonsense out but the plot was strong and moved along well the characters though still new seem to be well rounded and not always what you would expect the vulcans are clearly being presented very differently than before with a slightly ominous theme i particularly liked the linguist who is the first star trek character to not be able to stand proud in the face of death but rather has to deal with her phobias and fears they seemed to stay true to trek lore something that has been a significant problem in past series though they have plenty of time to bring us things like shooting through shields the instant invention of technology that can fix anything and the inevitable plethora of time travel stories anyone want to start a pool on how long before the borg show up all in all the series has enormous potential they are seeing the universe with fresh eyes we have the chance to learn how things got the way they were in the later series how did the klingons go from just insulting to war how did we meet the romulans how did the federation form and just who put earth in charge why is the prime directive so important if they address these things rather than spitting out time travel episodes this will be an interesting series my favorite line zephram cochran saying where no man has gone before not no one
i was very impressed with this small independently made picture the story about a pair of social outcasts who meet become friends and provide each other with a support system both seemed to lack as children is at times hilarious at times sad but always provocative music mostly by underground bands was used to great effect as was the experimentation with camera angles filters and slow or fast motion techniques the performances the leads are played by the writers and directors of the film are some of the best i ve seen in the last couple of years if you ever felt like a square peg being forced into a round slot i really believe you ll appreciate by hook or by crook
in a little town in montana two brothers grow up one of them is norman craig sheffer the other is paul brad pitt their father is reverend maclean and they grow up with his lessons that has to do with religion and the lessons of fly fishing in this movie fly fishing represents life a little the story is good and keeps your attention although there are some moments you need a little action probably the movie has this moments because it is not really about the events that happen but about the message some things do happen though norman goes to dartmouth to study after six years he returns and gets involved with a nice girl named jessie emily lloyd and he is invited to teach in chicago paul has become a reporter and is known as the fishing reporter he is famous and it seems he has a nice life but he drinks a little too much and gambles too much the movie is very well directed it has a nice score and all of the actors are good the most beautiful thing in this movie is the cinematography the mountains the woods and the river all look very beautiful if the movie was only made for these things it was good enough to watch fortunately there is more
two movies back to back which dealt with indian pows veer zaara and deewaar although veer zara was a love story of a guy who gives everything up for someone deewaar focuses on the main subject itself it is not hidden that many indian pows are rotting in pakistani jails for years for whom neither indian govt has time or sympathy nor the other side i m sure some of pakistani pows are in india as well but let s focus on the movie full of actors some were stage actors like raghubir yadav rajendra gupta etc amitabh bachchan who plays the role of a major acted well akshaye khanna did his part well there was nothing for amrita rao to do than a few giggles and couple songs i think sanjay dutt s role was most solid even though it wasn t too long he acted really well here and his dialog delivery was also impressive if you compare it to loc which was nothing but a day long movie with story going in all directions if it had a story deewaar is a well directed movie that keeps a good pace and does justice to all actors
yes giorgio is a feel good movie a little romance great music beautiful scenery comedy a great food fight and a little taste of bittersweet are the ingredients of yes giorgio any movie buff would enjoy this film those who require massive special effects should look elsewhere most of us need a little escape now and then and how better to do this than with a feast for the eyes ears and heart a must see
this is an intimate movie of a sincere girl in the real world out of hollywood s cheap fantasy is a very good piece of its class and ashley judd fills the role impeccably it may appear slow for thrill seekers though cool movie for a calm night
i loved this movie it was one of the years best pornos i remember watching it on starz or some god damn thing but it was great i only saw like half of it and i taped it and all i can say is i loved every minute of what i saw i didnt sleep for weeks after i saw this movie although i was very tired
ayone who whines about how this movie was crap or that it had no plot must have been looking for jean de florrette hello this film was made to be a random act of comedy and in no way involves a plot in any way shape or form i would also like to remind these whiners that if you are going to flay the crap out of this film that they seem to be missing the point this film is clearly made for people who don t appreciate the so called american humour which seems to me just a pile of smutty crap the point is everyone has an opinion and you should be a bit more appreciative that some peoples sense of humour may not be in line with your own before shooting your mouth off thankyou
gorgeous barbara bach plays jennifer fast a television reporter who travels with her crew karen lamm and lois young to solvang california to cover a danish festival the problem is that their accommodations have fallen through and all hotels in town are full so they travel out of town to a remote location and take advantage of the hospitality of the seemingly friendly ernest keller a phenomenal sydney lassick wouldn t you know it ernest and meek partner virginia lelia goldoni are hiding a big secret in their cellar pitiable deformed diaper clad junior stephen furst in a remarkable performance who ultimately terrorizes the girls a deliciously unhinged lassick plays the true monster in this disturbing little horror movie it builds slowly but surely to an intense confrontation climax delivering the horror in small doses until the final half hour the hotel and the foreboding cellar large echoes of psycho here are great settings most of all the perverse plot involves incest and patricide allowing the movie to take on a truly dark quality and yet it also becomes poignant as we realize junior is no one dimensionally evil bogeyman but as much a victim as the girls the final shot is especially sad the unseen is a solid little horror flick worthy of discovery
every now and then a film maker brings to life a unique group of people and lets you inside to see the things that make us human lawrence kasden done this again i always felt thebg cill was the anthem of it s age and he has managed to do it again in grand canyon every so often we find ourselves at a point where we have the opportunity to choose life and so often we blow it this is a film about people who find the courage to choose and experience life because of that choice the juxtaposing of little and big events that lets us see how basically trivial most things we worry about are is truly genius i have watched this film a number of times and am constanly surprised at how deep the emotions run through this film danny glover and kevin kline do their roles with great tenderness and stever martins portrayal of a movie exec is priceless thank you again mr kasden
when deathtrap was first released the poster reproduced on the cover of this dvd offered a graphic akin to a rubik s cube it is an appropriate image originally written for the stage by ira levin who authored such memorable works as rosemary s baby and the stepford wives the play was one of broadway s most famous twisters and under sidney lumet s direction it translates to the screen extremely well deathtrap is one of those films that it is very difficult to discuss for to do so in any detail gives away the very plot for which it is famous but the opening premise is extremely clever sidney bruhl michael caine is the famous author of mystery plays but these days he seems to have lost his touch after a particularly brutal opening night an old student named clifford anderson christopher reeve sends him a script for a play he has written it is called deathtrap and sidney recognizes it as a surefire hit just the sort of hit that would revive his career indeed a hit to die for and when clifford visits to discuss the play events suddenly begin to twist in the most unexpected manner possible like anthony shaffer s equally twisty sleuth deathtrap is really a story more at home on the stage than the screen to reach full power it needs the immediacy that a live performance offers still under the expert guidance of director sidney lumet it makes a more than respectable showing on the screen much of this is due to the cast which is remarkably fine michael caine gives a truly brilliant performance dyan cannon is funny and endearing as sidney s relentlessly anxious wife and christopher reeve gives what might be the single finest performance in his regrettably short acting career if you can t see it in a first rate theatrical production this will more than do until one comes along gary f taylor aka gft amazon reviewer

i am surprised than many viewers hold more respect for the sequel to this brilliant movie i have seen all the guinea pigs and this one is easily the best even though ive seen the making of i still have doubts when watching those mins of pure torture its that powerful a out of because this movie achieved perfectly what it set out to do be the best fake snuff film ever made
this oddity from roman polanski clearly shows where his preoccupations lay at the time he made it polanski himself plays a timid man who rents a parisian apartment where the previous tenant committed suicide he becomes obsessed with discovering what led her to it to the point that he s dressing in drag and reenacting events the way they might have unfolded the movie s unsettling to a point and it has that atmosphere of creepy dread that polanski excels at but it comes off too much as a rehash of rosemary s baby and repulsion two other better polanski films that deal with the eerie goings on in moody apartments but as for the preoccupation unless i m reading too much into the film i have to believe that this was polanksi s reaction to the feelings of persecution he felt at being labeled a sexual pervert and exiled from america not making a judgement about him one way or the other myself but it s hard to deny the evidence of that in the movie itself grade b

this is a feel good film about one person s dreams and the drive or push to realize them it is a beautiful and inspirational film why do some people have to try and find fault with every film that comes out especially the good ones dennis quaid gives a good solid performance in this true story of jim morris a science teacher and high school baseball coach who is pushed by his team to take one more shot at a professional baseball career with excellent supporting cast including brian cox as the crusty old ex navy officer who has let so much of his son s achievements go by without his support it was good to see him as something other than a villain in a film if i have one complaint with this film it is this don t ever let royce applegate sign the national anthem again seriously this film belongs to that handful of great baseball films like field of dreams and the natural it rates two thumbs up and a big well done

this is a fantastic series first and foremost it is very well done and very interesting as a huge wwii buff i had learned a lot before seeing this series one of the best things this has going for it is all the interviews with past individuals back when the war was relatively fresh in their minds comparatively speaking that is it is nothing against the men that you see getting interviewed in the programs of today it is just that most of these men weren t really involved in the upper echelons of what was happening then one of the best parts is the narrating by sir laurence oliver i would recommend this to anyone that wants to learn about wwii but really think only the die hards such as myself will want to buy this or watch it more than once my only real complaint about this entire series is that some of the facts aren t quite as accurate as we now know especially with the information about soviet union is exaggerated or just plain inaccurate in places that information is now different we now know because of the fall of the ussr overall a fascinating look at wwii and a must see for any serious wwii historian professional or personal alike
lillian hellman one of america s most famous women playwrights was a woman with a mission her leftist views were not well regarded at the time in the country in her memoir she recounts her trip to the then soviet union as she was intrigued with the so called successes achieved by that system watch on the rhine must have come as a result of those years the left wing in america as all over the world had an issue with the rise of fascism not only in europe but in japan as well watch on the rhine was a play produced on broadway eight months before the pearl harbor attack by the japanese in it ms hellman was heralding america s entrance in world war ii the adaptation is credited to ms hellman and dashiell hammett her long time companion as directed for the screen by herman shumlin the film was well received when it premiered in we are introduced to the muller family when the film opens they are crossing the border to the united states from mexico they are to continue toward mrs muller s home in washington d c where her mother fanny farrelly is a minor celebrity hostess the mullers we realize are fleeing europe because of the persecution there against the opponents of the advancing totalitarian regime in germany in fact we thought in a way the mullers could have been better justified if they were jewish fleeing from a sure extermination we find out that mr muller has had a terrible time in his native land as well as in other places because his outspokenness in denouncing fascim little does he know that he is coming to his mother in law s house that is housing one of the worst exponents of that philosophy the film offers excellent acting all around it is a curiosity piece because of bette davis supporting role paul lukas repeating his broadway role is quite convincing as kurt muller the upright man that wants to make a better world for himself and his family mr lukas does a great job portraying kurt muller repeating the role that made him a stage luminary on broadway the other best performance is by lucile watson who plays fanny farrelly the matriarch of this family geraldine fitzgerald is seen as marthe de brancovis a guest of the farrellys married to the contemptible teck de brancovis a nazi sympathizer played by george coulouris beulah bondi donald woods and the rest of the supporting cast give good performances guided by mr shumlin the film should serve as a reminder about the evils of totalitarian rule no matter where
loulou delights in the same way an expensive high quality french wine does it leaves you with a very fine aftertaste loulou s theme isn t new the film doesn t carry an original plot either its colored picturing shows fine but not extraordinary its setting is serious its elegant styling never and nowhere puts any weight on your mind whatever one further may say about loulou it s beyond doubt that this very french film stands out for its excellent acting the three leads convincingly reflect all numerous doubts and tenses sparkling between them making the plot alive their acting fully invites you to participate to make friends for those around at the time loulou also provides an extra bonus its perfectly captured mood of
the events of the th of september cast its shadow on this oscar award ceremony with a one minute silence before the in memoriam montage and there was little in the way of the all singing all dancing comedy extravaganza that we d come to expect of this award show but this was by no means a bad thing entertainment was more or less curtailed to a lotr send up with ben stiller and owen wilson and that was it the rest of the show was taken up with clips from the nominations and i have to admit this was actually more enjoyable than the overblown song and dance numbers we ve seen over the years and whoopi goldberg was by no means a bad presenter unlike the very esoteric david letterman from a few years ago and the one minute silence for the victims of was haunting and dignified as for the awards new zealand was absolutely robbed fellowship of the ring went home with four minor awards while a beautiful mind undeservingly picked up most of the major prizes except for best actor which should have gone to a tough guy new zealander but went to an an all american nice guy instead the only oscar awards i agreed with apart from the ones presented to fellowship were the awards for best supporting actress and best supporting actor both correct calls
this has long been one of my favourite adaptations of an austen novel although it is definitely not in the same category as the spectacular pride and prejudice emma is a lush and relatively faithful tv version of austen s novel especially considering its short length the biggest change between the novel and the movie is a good one as the unnecessary snobbishness that austen exhibits at the end of the story is removed here and replaced with someone much more akin to emma s character in the rest of the book i thought the characters chosen to portray the roles were well picked kate beckinsale walks the fine line between girlishness and the social snob with a grace completely lost in gwyneth paltrow s version samantha morton s wispy blonde locks suit her attitude and character as the simper that accompanies her role in previous characterisations is replaced with the harriet we know from the book mister knightly s role is carried out extremely well in my opinion both the seriousness and the gentle compassion that the hero is painted with in the novel are present here in this much neglected sumptuous film
hello i was alanrickmaniac i m a still crazy holic it was just another movie i watched partly on tv then i had to get the video tape to finally find out how it ends then i wanted the dvd because the tape showed first signs of decay after a few weeks after the dvd i had to lay my hands on the soundtrack then on several film posters and the film script right now it has become that worse that i try to push other people into addiction with my website and still crazy parties how could that happen what drove me into addiction ok it s one of those funny but somehow sad and melancholic intelligent comedies like only the british can produce alright the movie is worlds apart from stuff like this is spinal tap because of the characters that aren t childish or ultra cool but real this is a story about men getting older too a story about men getting along with each other or don t it contains some of the best actors possible tim spall stephen rea bruce robinson jimmy nail and bill nighy bill nighy who puts on one of the best performances i ve ever seen in a film good the soundtrack is unbelievable foreigner s mick jones has written the songs for the imaginary band strange fruit jimmy nail who plays bass man les wickes and bill nighy portraying the egocentric but awkward singer ray simms are really singing we know that about jimmy nail but if you ve only heard bill nighy s singing in love actually you have no idea how great and powerful his voice is well you ll fever for every scene to come for the x th time especially those concert scenes you d die to be able to really stand in the dancing crowd when strange fruit is doing all over the world singing on the top of your lungs you long to cry and celebrate with thousands of people the rebirth of the real strange fruit at wisbech s festival stage it s hard but i m addicted to this film i m addicted to strange fruit if there s a world where this band really exists i d like to move there got still crazy anyone
just get it the dvd is cheap and easy to come by the length is now standard and you ve gone long enough without it when home video started there were at least three versions with parts missing everything you ve read is true there is no defending it and no living without it the color is lush and wonderful to look at and the production values are pretty good for a saturday afternoon kiddie epic but no question the whole santa vs satan angle is so jaw dropping strange it made the movie a hit at the time and a cult fave once home video really got underway how good bad strange is it i only saw the trailer as a kid and remembered it for nearly years including murray s over the top voice over i told my older sister and she called me a liar and could not believe it was possible for anyone to make a movie where santa vs satan add to it stuff like santa asking for the virgin mary s blessing before setting off on christmas eve kids wanting to capture him and make him their slave and an international kiddie sweat shop and it probably comes close to a lot of nightmares kids had in the s like others here i watch the thing every holiday season now my version of choice is the mystery science theatre edition but any old way you choose it the movie is a demented masterpiece and a total must along with brianiac by the way it never fails to make me laugh better i think then santa claus conquers the martians parts of it can still make you cringe or just creep you out how many parents do you know go out for cocktails on christmas eve if you get bored just go downstairs and play the piano dang freaky boring disturbing funny childish strange hey what more can you want
i just saw valentine and i have to say that it was the best slasher movie that i ve seen in years unlike the recent trend of s horror flicks this movie is more concerned with being eerie than it is with being self mocking for those out there that hated scream there is not one reference to the horror rules in this movie even though the old slasher movie rules do apply here this is the perfect blend of s and s horror you get the style cinematography and good acting of s films and the stalking slasher madness of an s flick i guess the year is going to finally give horror fans the kind of movies they were longing for this is definitely a move in the right direction denise richards stands out here as a fun character you can tell she liked her role and that makes her stand out i loved her in this movie
i m not kidding about that summary and vote the video distributors have packaged this as just another typical s werewolf movie but it is in fact the greatest parody of the horror genre that you can imagine having done for the horror movie what blazing saddles did for the western i have seen plenty of comedies good bad stupid weird etc usually walking away unimpressed and i think that comedy must be the most difficult genre for filmmakers and actors to work in it takes just the right kind of touch to make things successful and part of that is having good ideas full moon high is bulging with good ideas so many in fact that it can easily put the zucker abrams team of airplane and naked gun to shame one of the best of these is the very presence of ed mcmahon in a starring role as a john birch style right wing crackpot the jokes non sequiturs wisecracks and word play are literally non stop and everything including the kitchen sink has been thrown in the ironic tone is very similar to that of back to the future some people i e almost every reviewer here must have been turned off by the spirit of anarchy here but i almost died of laughter and this is one of those movies in which you never know what kind of insane situation will transpire next since b movie extraordinaire larry cohen had not made a straight comedy before this one gets the sense that he was making up for lost time by including any joke he or his collaborators could think of if mel brooks had made this the critics would have labelled it a comic masterpiece but because it was made by cohen it has been dismissed as schlock critical reviews have called this movie too silly silly what is a comedy supposed to be serious anyway i laughed out loud more for this movie than any other i can think of cohen makes fun of everyone himself included with plenty of references to his usual brand of low rent film making he and the actors must have had a complete blast making this the humor is very mel brooks ish and anyone who loves jewish humor or watches a lot of b movies especially horror will love this trust me the movie isn t too hard to find and as long as you accept it for what it is a roller coaster of belly laughs with no pretense of social value whatsoever then you ll truly enjoy it one sidenote this movie should somehow go down in history as the one thing bob saget ever starred in albeit briefly that was actually funny
if the man in the white suit had been done in america can t you see either danny kaye or jerry lewis trying on alec guinness s sidney stratton on for size this is one of the best of alec guinness s films and certainly one of the best that ealing studios in the united kingdom ever turned out it s so perfectly fits within the time frame of the new labour government and the society it was trying to build it s amazing how in times of crisis capital and labor can agree alec guinness this meek little schnook of a man is obsessed with the idea that he can invent clothing that will never need cleaning that in fact repels all kinds of foreign matter the minute it touches the garment he s a persistent cuss and he does succeed of course the implications haven t really been thought through about the kind of impact clothing like that will have on society in the end everyone is chasing him down like they would a fugitive almost like peter lorre from m or orson welles in the stranger or even robert newton in oliver twist it s the mark of a great comedy film that a potentially serious situation like that chase as described in some of the serious films i ve mentioned can be played for laughs poor guinness s suit is not only white and stain repellent but it glows like a neon sign other than guinness the best performances are from cecil parker as yet another pompous oaf joan greenwood as his siren daughter and ernest thesiger the biggest clothing manufacturer in the uk come to think of it did paramount borrow that suit from ealing and give it to john travolta for saturday night fever
when my sister said this movie was gonna be good i had second thoughts but i watched it and it was actually funny basically the movie is made of a weird girl who goes to a small town where no one likes her and she just wants to go there and get the reading of her aunts will don so she can go but its not all that easy in this movie you will come across hilarious humor a witch a book of spells recopies a mentally challenged uncle and a dog you will understand the meaning of the word freak a after anyways i hope you run right out and try to find this really old movie hope you like it in total i will have to give it a no i m totally joking ill give it a hope you understand that you will laugh you will scream and you may just be offended love yours truly dakota you can email me at dakota loves it hot mail com if you wanna
if you re going to put on a play within the prison walls why not go for the top playwright william shakespeare and if you are going to choose your cast from a whole lot of criminals serving long sentences for the most heinous crimes you can be sure there will be plenty of time for rehearsals in a kentucky correctional prison a courageous project such as this was undertaken with amazing results this film shows how it was all done the casting the rehearsals the set and costumes and the final presentation of shakespeare s play the tempest it had not occurred to me before but there is an analogy between the setting of the play and the correctional prison in the play the ship wrecked characters are confined to an island with no contact with the outside world prison life too is much like that with a simple painted back drop of a surrounding seascape the characters in a most pleasing assortment of costumes bellow out their lines to an approving audience may be not quite as shakespeare intended but with good heart and true sincerity for sure more interesting than the play itself were the little cameos of each man behind his character one inmate saw the play as a lesson in forgiveness another as a redemption of his sins it was quite moving to see the men wipe away a tear as they spoke of murder shooting and strangulation one had the feeling that they would all like to wind back the clock and reconsider their brutal actions however as someone said the past was past and the present was the beginning of a new future at least the play gave temporary relief from the depressing thoughts of past events the prison authorities should be applauded for allowing the play to take place such an event would put kentucky on the map and hopefully other prisons might follow their good example it seems to me that everyone stands to benefit not only the kentucky prison but the prisoners themselves who need to find new confidence and self esteem and be prepared for the day when they go out on parole
i settled back to watch read my lips a plate of freedom fries before me the food was quickly forgotten as i became engrossed by director and co writer jacques audiard s original and superb thriller carla emmanuelle devos is a secretary at a firm that develops major building projects she actually has some significant responsibilities that don t often fall to secretaries and she s capable and ambitious and thwarted by a male hierarchy that will exploit but not reward her work piling up faster than she can handle it carla is told to hire a secretary enter ex con and general layabout paul vincent cassel he lies about his skills and in fact has none that any legitimate enterprise might require after an initial serious misunderstanding by paul as to carla s interest in him the two become allies a quirky friendship starts in a stunt that would have made a real carla a major contender on the apprentice she trumps her egotistic male adversary at work with paul s connivance exit the rival carla is virtually deaf without her hearing aid with it she hears almost normally she turns the hearing aid off to isolate herself from unpleasant sounds and annoying people she s also very lonely a heroic makeup effort was made to have her appear plain but she s truly beautiful she hasn t a boyfriend she babysits so a friend can have a liaison it is a french movie worse and humiliatingly she accedes to a girlfriend s plea that she hang out somewhere while that married friend has it off with her paramour in carla s bed not nice as carla and paul get to know each other better the barely repressed larcenous side of the not so former felon emerges there s a side story by the way of paul s relationship with his parole officer which neatly complements the main plot and has its own big surprise ending read my lips ingenious paul recognizes that carla s ability to read lips even from a considerable distance is more than the amusing parlor trick it first seems to be from there a caper develops enough said paul and carla are a true criminal oddball couple she wants love but will also accept money he wants her sort of but business must come before possible erotic satiation together cassel and devos are strong actors carrying an unusual crime tale to its end very convincingly rent it or buy it but if you enjoy a good crime story you ll go for read my lips and you may well want to watch it several times i do
there are few films or movies i consider favorites over the years the gospel road was one of them i watched this as a young teen and would like the opportunity to watch it again my favorite parts were the fact that jesus was blond the last supper was a huge meal he liked playing with the children his death was for all people and for all time the movie may not have been theologically sound or high quality acting but it touched my heart at that time besides i am a johnny cash fan and it was a brave venture if it ever comes out on dvd i will purchase it purely for sentimental reasons
here i thought nanook of the north was the last word in archaic semi doc eskimo movies how wrong as an avid sea kayaker i stayed up till am to watch this hoping to get a glimpse of some hand made skin boats the movie did not let me down any student of kayak umiak construction should have a look see here note to fellow skers they appear to be using norton sound kayaks with single blade paddles but the film went way beyond this admittedly narrow interest even though there were as others have noted some little back shot fakey bits the movie has so much heart they are just a minor annoyance it was from this very amateur anthropologist s viewpoint probably the perfect time to make this movie early thirties the talkies are so new that they including louie b mayer actually let the inuit speak in their own tongue and there is so much that was still despite the infused melodrama authentic they are really whacking that polar bear that whale and those caribou a fifties version of this film would have been so cheesy with stars technicolor etc to gum it up the seventies version don t even a very good companion piece to this excellent movie is white shadows in the south seas geograpically the mirror image to eskimo it also deals with the relentless and profound disruption of western culture technology on an unsuspecting people
party girl capitalizes on the tremendous charm of parker posey in fact at times the movie seems to be a vehicle in which ms posey is allow to play herself as she normally is in real life the film directed by daisy von scherler mayer is a treat for ms posey s fans ms von scherler mayer takes us on a wild trip into lower manhattan to show us this aimless soul whose life is dedicated to have fun in the different clubs she constantly frequents this is an era that still was more naive than what that area and the adjacent meat market districts became at least there are no pretensions in the films and we see down to earth people going about their lives in a normal way if we can call it that way parker posey makes an amazing mary it s because of parker posey we enjoy the movie more than if another actress would have played mary she is the whole picture the rest of the cast is good
answer despite that fact that this film was written and directed by a woman your ex is creepier nastier and more irrational than any zombie that ever lurched the earth the acting in this independent film actually is quite good despite the less than wonderful script it takes a pretty good actor to deliver an overwritten clich d line and make it sound vaguely believable young anthony de marco as jake puts in a particularly good performance fortunately the plot of this film is a lot better than the dialog try it especially if you re not a monster fan this is not a horror flick even though all the adult females are pretty monstrous and although all the adult males act as if their brains were eaten in some earlier zombie film jake s closet is suitable for mature adults the whole this time is much better than the sum of its parts
this gripping tale of intergenerational love jealousy and revenge was even more enjoyable to see on dvd years after its pbs broadcast with a sharper picture and crisper sound my only reservations are that the plot has a few improbable moments and that some of the stronger manchester accents are difficult at times luckily even missing a word here and there won t spoil the fun the primary actors are ideally cast robson green brings an enigmatic smile a go for broke temperament and an athletic physicality to his role as a young surgeon who falls hopelessly for the wife of his boss at the hospital where he s just begun to work francesca annis is one of the most striking ish women imaginable her acting rivals her beauty the love scenes between these two demonstrate better than words how little the age difference matters to them each of the supporting characters is sharply drawn and excellently portrayed as well the mix of pithy dialog and passionate excess makes this a delightful miniseries as russell baker notes in his introduction you may not be morally improved by viewing reckless but you ll have plenty of fun the sequel a part of the dvd box set provides a wild yet satisfying two hour denouement you won t want to miss it if you ve enjoyed what came before
i ve always enjoyed kenneth branagh s versions of the shakespeare classics as he always does a very good job but in this movie the one who lifts the whole movie is none other than the always great actor laurence fishburne surely he has made some poor choices in films even though he s a wonderful actor but in this one we re truly given the real othello the passion the intensity of jealousy as it grows stronger alongside with fishburne s well portrayed paranoia and furthermore we re finally given a black othello i don t think they could have chosen a better othello who else could have given him that blend of sympathy antipathy love hatred and not to forget those fiery eyes branagh is good as always but not at his peak ir ne jacob s desdemona is fairly good but a bit bleak whilst laurence fishburne truly lifts it and makes it a very interesting and enjoyable movie do watch it
i enjoyed this film very much tobey maguire gives a terrific performance as jake he has got to be one of the best actors i have seen and i was surprised there were so many humorous lines throughout the film he was extremely good at this too although i have never seen him deliver a comic line before the film gets you involved with the characters and really makes you wonder what is to become of them all i did not know what to expect from jewel s performance but i think she did rather well lots of exciting scenes a thoroughly good ride i am absolutely a fan of maguire s check out cider house rules one of the all time best ever
i just saw the drugs years on vh and i love it i think it reflects the drug history very well and most importantly it has a strong message to the all generations there is woodstock there are joplin s hendrix s and jim morrison s deaths there are many many examples of drug use and drug abuse it completely cover the time line and evolution of drug use in america in both good and bad ways in my opinion this documentary is well done and i would like to congratulate to its creators because this is exactly what is needed to be playing in the tv in these days i am waiting for the dvd release you should definitely see it this movie is stunning big time
this is one of my favorites along with the mariette hartley and robert lansing sandy and the agnes moorhead and the tiny spacemen episodes it is an important take from mid on the long cold war that the u s was then embroiled in the beaten down city scene the near starving characters sparse dialog their threadbare uniforms and the minimal action says it all the absurdity of an on going conflict that threatens to destroy human life modern civilization and all that is sweet and redeeming about it it is a fable because it was made in a time in which had events turned out differently such as the second berlin crisis spring and the subsequent cuban missile crisis oct it would have actually been a reasonable representation of one of the u s s major cities ruined and replete with a few miserable survivors i also see it as a fable because it is not only a cautionary tale but because it is the most redemptive of all our popular myths it is a love story set in an impossible situation and involving two highly mismatched lovers
i love this show every time i watch an episode i repeat that line and remind myself how good of a show this is i am a huge sci fi fan and this show has grounds to be the most important science fiction show in the history of film tv there are so many theories in this show about the universe i could start a religion its amazing season after season the show gets better and better i ve been a fan of macgyver since i was now and i find it so ironic that my favorite tv shows of all time star richard dean anderson its also interesting how each character is practically the opposite of the other back when i first saw stargate the movie i instantly liked it and considered it one of my favorite sci fi flicks then hearing a tv show would spin from it i got really excited but didn t get showtime till the fifth season was almost over though i m disappointed to hear that roland emmerich and dean devlin wanted to do a trilogy of movies but the studio optioned the series instead id say though that it turned out just fine maybe even better this show is amazing and i hope it never dies atlantis here we come
when i was young i had seen very few movies my parents in all their wisdom rented this one i was very wary of what the movie was about in fact i wasn t even allowed to watch it my brother and sister got to of course and this made me very angry so what did i do late at night i trashed the vcr kicked the screen of the tv in and called the police and reported vandals i was arrested of course i was unable to get my foot out of the tv set before the police arrived i was only given a stern talking to and sent home my parents grounded me of course and made me work to repay the debt for the tv and vcr this tore me apart slave labour really sucks believe me but i had to do it chores all around the house what happened in the end we got a big screen tv dvd player and a surround sound system for my work how did i get the money easy i made movies of my own and sold them to disney do you remember finding neno well i wrote that movie and filmed my goldfish in their fish tanks they rewrote the plot of course and did it in cgi because they couldn t afford to make it a real life action picture like i had done in the end i never saw the film the head that didn t die and the rating i gave it is my life rating it s doing pretty good
a well made run of the mill movie with a tragic ending pluses the way the story moves begins with soorya struggling to live followed by a long flashback about why he s there the music a disinterested look at the life of policemen minuses the violence and the gore but i guess they add to the realistic effects still having people s heads chopped off and sent in boxes and sacks could have been avoided no complaints
i was years old when i saw this musical movie while on vacation with my family in st thomas in and immediately fell in love with it years later it is still an original inspiration for achieveing my goals that i have set to accomplish since that time this tragic story of a hard core behind the scenes of the entertainment industry during the late s sparkle successfully portrays the struggle of three young sisters looking for their place in the sun this story could simply become the biographical story of many young aspiring artists about what could materialize when things seem to happen too fast and role models are not available to lend a helping hand the phenomenal music written and composed by aretha franklin and curtis mayfield the soundtrack carries the plot with every song from being subjected to situations that almost leave no choice for strong long term decision making to making the ultimate sacrifice in order to get ahead all three young girls sparkle sister and delores represent the different routes that one could take when you set out to achieve your ideal opportunity as your contribution to society this movie could have possibly spawned the ideas of creating dreamgirls on broadway and mariah carey s glitter years later as an original audience member of both productions i have seen a lot of similarities in both stories to sparkle as well as in saturday night fever fame flashdance and the off broadway smash hit mama i want to sing
carlos mencia was excellent this is hour special he was working hard to show everybody he was the real deal i know people have said he s stolen material in this special but that is not true carlos brings comedy up front the way he wants it not how anyone else wants it that is why he is so good people say he s not funny because he says dee dee dee too much and they still haven t realized thats part of his act and they don t want it that way but he brings it like that anyway and succeeds in making people laugh for all the haters out there here is a message carlos is here to stay you have no point in trying to bring him down
and that goes especially for lawyers cops puerto rico which boasts of a small but potent film production firm brings this multi layered tale of corruption due to the on going drug cartel that starts in south america makes a pit stop on the island commonwealth and then northbound into north america steven bauer the most recognizable face on screen here leads a cast of top notch actors in a story of can you spot the only respectable face in the crowd ricardo mendez matta moves up from directing mainly action adventure fare for american television in a screenplay written by matta along with poli marichal the rest of the cast elpidia carrillo magda rivera jose herredia luz maria randon to mention a few turn in oh so fine roles in a film that will keep you wondering is there any respectable characters here spoken in spanish with english subtitles rated r by the mpaa this film contains outbursts of vulgar language brief flashes of nudity adult content violence some of which is quite lurid
at first i didn t like the movie cause of it being a nazi swastika drama but after buying it and seeing it it wasn t that bad i heard so many complaints about the numbers being short and ilse werner not singing now i understand the radio show was a super propaganda radio program ilse johanne and zara plus rudy shruki and band like kurt widman and his orchestra and fud cantics ex cetera never appeared in the radio show cause the singers and the bands were of the pop jazz and swing categories the club foot had that regulated that for touring occupied areas for the soldiers to short wave radios for the soldiers also night clubs and hotels in berlin and hamburg and record sales only this is why ilse wasn t allowed to sing in this picture this would be made up by medium budget musical were making music in which she would demonstrate her whistling but this is an excellent example propaganda inge and her aunt eichhorn played by ida wust goes to the olympics the aunt forgets her tickets so inge has to wait till her aunt comes back with the tickets she meets carle radditz who plays herbert who has an extra ticket she goes with him and it s love at first sight they plan to marry but the spanish war get in the way so he has to go on an assignment against the right side carl raddatz as so many people complained about him was really handsome and not plain when he did opfergang and they put a mustache on him plus his own suntan that made him plain looking you see the nazi soldiers acting normal like a scene in which a ex butcher and his troops are in france and they steal pigs from a farm and they are about to make lunch until their leader suggest to save the pigs this reflect adolphs animal rights extremism the character was a butcher now soldier this was a subtle put down against meat eating late on in world war herbert is flying in a german airplane we shoot one of the pilots so herbert takes over we shoot his plane they crash unfortunately for us they survive another seen the nazis soldiers go in a bomb catholic church now it s putting the catholics down and hubert s best friend helmet played by joachim brennecke starts to play the organ beethtoven more bombs come in from us the church is bomb more the soldier continues to stay and play the organ he s being told to leave we end up injuring him propaganda message the catholic church organ cause him to become addicted to it it injured him see by this time inge is with her either mother or grandma played hedwig bleibteu the same german grandame actress who played maria holst s aunt in weiner blut well later it comes to the short view of the radio show this was not intended to be a musical revue such as kora terry released that same year were as well as rosen in tirol the music as well as their side of the war was so supposed to be only the back drop it was mainly a war romantic movie it s easy to take a pot shot at those soldier in the movie but in real life many of those soldiers were being forced to fight the nazi cause cause of the job and the monthly pay that they would receive after the war many of them who survive would regret it this is a good swastika classic the only problem is that today you have neo nazi and nazi skin heads who watched the same movies to reflect their hitler worship and their they have disturbing websites who exploit these film classics to raise money for their insanity be careful most of the time it s the direct hate only classics if their scenario looks like they are glorifying it then its a nazi website skip it go to ihf or german wartime films dot com amazon dot dee or german video dot net they are legitimate mada a mistake it wasn t herbert s friend that got killed at the church it was malte yager s character s friend schartzscop
kolchak the night stalker is a hugely entertaining tv series in which a pushy sarcastic forty something reporter is repeatedly drawn into mortal combat with supernatural and occasionally extraterrestrial forces based on a very popular pair of tv movies featuring the kolchak character this series died a quick death in the mid s due to low ratings but it nevertheless maintains a strong cult following today but will the average modern day viewer be able to dig kolchak and his weekly clashes with the undead that s actually a tough question to answer fairly detractors of this series tend to argue that it s formulaic and hopelessly dated on the other hand fans argue that it s cleverly written well acted and sometimes genuinely spooky and me i ve got a foot in both camps i thoroughly enjoyed watching all episodes of kolchak on dvd recently though i can plainly see that the series has major flaws i ll address the question of kolchak being formula fiction first now i think we can all agree that most tv shows have formulas just about every episode of columbo unfolds according to the same pattern for example repetition is not necessarily a bad thing in itself in fact critics have long recognized that audiences often enjoy and actively seek out repetitive entertainment however the problem with kolchak is that its formula is simply too rigid it s too repetitive even by the most generous standards in almost every episode kolchak investigates a murder and figures out that it was committed by some form of monster he tries to publish a story about said monster but his editor vincenzo blocks him always on the grounds that kolchak doesn t have sufficient evidence to support his claims that supernatural forces are at work and alas kolchak is also obstructed by the police so in the end kolchak does some independent research on the monster figures out how to kill it and then kills it without ceremony or reward or writing a big story about it you can see where this ever so strict formula might get tiresome right i m particularly mystified by vincenzo if kolchak s always raving about monsters and vincenzo never believes it well then why doesn t vincenzo fire kolchak or have him committed that s what any normal boss would do but the series eschews such realism and prefers to keep vincenzo and kolchak as comical antagonists as a result many of their scenes together are profoundly unbelievable though they are also quite funny the very best episodes of kolchak manage to vault over the limitations of this formula however usually because they contain some kind of unexpected twist these select episodes are good enough that i think they re largely immune to typical criticisms of the series some of my favorites include horror in the heights an episode that s noteworthy for being grimy inventive and socially aware kolchak s dialog has an unusually sharp and cynical edge though it adheres closely to the kolchak formula the script written by hammer studios veteran jimmy sangster is remarkably literate and it delves deeply into the monster s backstory the devil s platform a possible inspiration for the omen films this episode stands out to me because the villain a very young tom skerritt tempts kolchak with a satanic contract full of goodies and in so doing reveals a lot about the reporter s character firefall this episode appears to have a bad reputation among fans but i enjoyed it because it s got a great red herring and a really creepy almost unstoppable seeming monster though i ve singled out these three episodes for praise i d say that most of the stories are entertaining at the very least for my money there are only two complete turkeys in the episode run primal scream which is about monkey men running rampant in chicago and the sentry which features the dumbest looking creature makeup in the history of filmed entertainment and this assessment is coming from a lifelong doctor who and godzilla fan on balance then this is a good series a little repetitive a little cheesy perhaps but it has elements of greatness even during the weaker episodes darren mcgavin s wonderful performance as the caustic world weary endlessly funny kolchak truly shines he carries the series effortlessly in a way that for example sarah michelle gellar never managed on buffy mcgavin was one great character actor and this series is worth watching for him alone
i love this movie it is one of those movies that you can watch time and time again and still find engaging congratulations i believe everyone involved in making the movie and the script should be proud of themselves it is so eerie you feel like you are watching a real life band i would like to see more movies like this i am glad that they did not choose famous hollywood stars to be in this movie because it probably would not have worked and even if billy connolly is quite well known he really got stuck into the role and i could not imagine anybody else playing it congratulations again i really believe this movie deserves the peter sellers comedy award for bill nighy and when you get to the final scene well what can i say
definitely one of the most witty and twisted who dunnit i ever seen christopher reeve and micheal caine were brilliant and kept me going through the whole affair very classy set pieces and the props really lend a sense of atmosphere to the proceedings the minimalist feel works for the whole picture my only complain isn t with the film itself but the lack of a decent widescreen edition of the movie on dvd i own the fullscreen version which proves i love the film enough to endure fullscreen presentation but a awesome deluxe or special edition would most surely get my cash
this film caught me by surprise my friend told me that this movie was a chick flick boy was he wrong this movie has a great family appeal with no sex scenes like other movies jake gyllenhaal does an excellent job in homer hickam s shoes the supporting cast is great as well science coming of age family quarrels a great train scene this film has it all the soundtrack is good although the score is presented quite choppily the s music kicks the movie over the edge of greatness the dvd is definitely worth its weigh in coal replay value is great i ve seen it quite a few times already
excellent episode movie ala pulp fiction days suicides it doesnt get more depressing than this movie rating music rating
i was about years old when i saw this classic casper the friendly ghost cartoon figured it was an early one since casper didn t look right the same way porky pig doesn t look right in the old s cartoons but i digress anyway this episode in the friendly phantom s afterlife concerns him befriending a young fox todd whom he names ferdie i remember being happy to see casper have a friend as those who have watched the cartoons are wont to know that most people run away from him screaming a ghost casper and ferdie have some fun together until someone else shows up i hate to leave you with a semi spoiler but the cartoon is only seven minutes long so you can t really be too ambiguous besides anyone who reads the imdb synopsis of the cartoon can deduce what happens next the finale is a bit heartbreaking in fact it s probably the saddest i ve ever felt watching a cartoon but that only means that it moved me which probably explains why i decided to write a comment on this particular cartoon and not very many others or heck the fact that i actually remember this cartoon at all is due to its emotional effect on me i haven t seen it since but the cartoon does end on an upbeat note and i was pleased to see casper and ferdie happy again i d give this cartoon out of stars second only to the warner bros cartoon peace on earth this is the most i ve ever been moved by an animated short
pretty good film from preminger labyrinthine at times as it explores sets and locales from various angles and perspectives as if it were a nature film on the denizens of the modern city and how they live in this sense it is visually and spatially satisfying as its hero a good cop with a bad temper gets into very hot water when he accidentally kills a guy with a plate in his head dana andrews plays the lead as if it were hamlet and has never been better the story may be pure melodrama but andrews gives it weight and almost raises it to the level of tragedy as his girl gene tierney is attractive but unremarkable gary merrill makes for a very interesting villain with his natural warmth providing a nice contrast to andrews coolness his smiling amiable seeming bad guy seems to be continually challenging his nemesis by the mere fact of his being emotionally open as opposed to the tightly wound and moralistic cop who is pursuing him there are no major surprises in this film which seems transitional for all concerned for director preminger it is a reunion of sorts with his laura stars andrews and tierney who were passing their career peaks at around the time the movie was made the supporting cast merrill karl malden neville brand are understandably more optimistic as they were all on their way up preminger as serene an observer as ever lets the events unfold without expressing a strong point of view as the morally ambiguous ending is somewhat disappointing for the cat and mouse game between the two antagonists seems larger and more archetypal than any mere movie could contain much less resolve
i caught this film at a test screening was very surprised to find a really sweet and fun story well acted natasha henstridge is the next julia roberts the male lead was awsome very funny film takes place in the best locations in new york made me want to go there i just saw you ve got mail i thought it had to be you was a much better story fresher it was clean and great for whole family i think it will do well audience i saw it with loved it a definite recommend

i really enjoyed the detail that went into the script jonathan rhys myers misspelled and jewel were outstanding in their support roles as was jeffery wright toby mcguire gave as fine a acting job as ever depicted when he had to amputate his best friend s arm knowing he would die without the procedure attention to detail with good dialect coaching to catch the southern accent incredibly well why this movie was swept under the rug by the hollywood promoters i can only imagine i have strong suspicions which makes it all the more appealing to me i have given a dozen dvd copies out for presents completely overlooked movie rent or buy it and give it your full attention for a couple of hours then judge
when i found the movie in the schedule for christmas its title did not sound familiar to me since i have not read the novel and had not heard anything about the film yet having read the content i decided to spend my christmas evening on watching the movie the effect surprised me totally i do not remember when i last saw a film in which every single moment involved me a vow to cherish is without any doubt one of the movies that now constitutes a real surprise i have received from cinema here are some arguments of mine why i consider this film a highly underrated piece of good cinema first the entire content is particularly educational it has something to offer to the modern audience pure right faith and some answers for the universal questions is there a need for christ in our times does love still matter what for is there faith what is the logics of burden and suffering in life is there really someone by my side i can always trust the movie provides the answers through the content since all that happens to the characters may as well happen to any of us second the movie is exceptionally humane the main characters experience inner struggles and cope with extremely hard decisions is it better for kyle david denman and teri megan paul to start their own lives and forget about the family or retain the values they were taught at home is it better for john ken howard to leave ellen barbara babcock his sick wife and start a new happy life with julia donna bullock a woman he falls in love with in fact ellen no longer recognizes him yet he decides to vow his wife eternal fidelity had john s rebellious brother phil d david morin better go on his easy life although it does not bring him satisfaction or once start to think seriously of his life phil s prayer to god in the park is a psychological masterwork of universal aspect of humanity these words could be as well said by everybody no matter of where when or how they live third the movie is a great portrayal of family not very popular nowadays there are problems yet there is always something more powerful that gets these people together this something is love and trust i know that it may seem a bit idealistic not all families can rely on fidelity and it may not be as simple as that nevertheless it is a very educational aspect and a realistic one fourth the entire film focuses on people s mutual help if we want to live happy lives in our society we must understand one thing we have to help one another alexander ossie davis is an example of such attitude at the beginning of the movie we see him talk to john about praying later he helps his brother alexander is a kinda angel that is sent to john and his family isn t it possible that we may become angels to one another fifth the artistic features are also worth attention performances barbara babcock gives an authentic performance as ellen and although she has a difficult role she does a perfect job consider for instance the moment she appears at school and badly wants to teach again ken howard is also memorable as the faithful husband picture the most memorable for me was the scene of john and ellen in the park walking on the fallen leaves autumn while the sunshine love spreads everywhere i interpreted as a sort of symbol even if there is sorrow this can always be illuminated by light and joy a vow to cherish is a wonderful movie that realistically showed to me what it means to love what fidelity is as well it once again proved to me how beautiful it is to live and believe at the end i would like to quote the profound words from the movie i found very touching and hope you will also do kyle to his uncle phil yes he john brighton lives according to the bible but nobody forces you to do so yet according to what rules do you live
what can you say about the film white fire amazing fantastic disturbing hilarious these words are not big enough to describe the event which is white fire from wobbly garbled beginning to profound end this movie will entertain throughout our movie begins in the woods of a country somewhere in the world a family is hiding from unmarked soldiers in costume shop uniforms when the father separates from the mother and their childen you get a real sense of what kind of movie you re about to watch father makes sure to roll down hills in his all white outfit and is polite as he gets people s attention before he shoots them but alas dad is burned alive in what looks like a very unsupervised unsafe stunt meanwhile mom and the kids are running down a beach with an armed soldier trailing about feet behind them he too gives a stern warning before action in the form of a bizarre halt and then promptly wastes the mother this action sequence sets up the happy childhood of our heroes bo and ingred so now we fast forward about years if you re honest about the hero s age to beautiful turkey where bo and ingred have settled as professional thieves or diamond prospectors or something ingred works at a diamond mine where she helps herself to the goods while bo masterfully played by the dynamic robert ginty drives around the desert in his denim outfits bo and ingrid have an interesting relationship they don t seem to have any friends other than each other and they spend all of their time together that coupled with the fact that bo has expressed his desire to sleep with his sister as evidenced in lines such as you know its a shame you re my sister he says to her while she s stark naked make for a very dynamic duo bo is then crushed when ingrid is killed as he wanders the beaches of turkey with his ceremonial pink grief scarf a renewal of hope occurs when bo finds a girl who looks like ingrid and gives her plastic surgery to make her look exactly like ingrid this opens the door for bo to have sex with his sister without it being technically wrong bo is a real fan of ethical grey areas and he is overjoyed with his new love so anyway there s a lot of fun action scenes ridiculous violence great acting impossible to follow plot lines fred the hammer williamson for some reason and a big chunk of dirty ice which is supposed to be a giant diamond which later explodes all of these things are great but the bo and ingrid relationship is what makes this movie special really special so i heartily encourage everyone to behold the majesty that is white fire you may be glad you did or not

it s amazing that from a good though not wonderful film made back in the early nineties a whole franchise can grow stargate sg is without a doubt a worthy addition to the science fiction genre and has the right to stand shoulder to shoulder with star trek as the kings of sci fi following on from the feature film stargate this series sees stargate command a military science organisation figuring out that the stargate system can be used to travel to various planets across the galaxy and beyond and the military sets up a number of teams to explore sg is one such team headed by military veteran colonel jack o neill and includes archaeologist doctor daniel jackson military scientist captain samantha carter and alien teal c who has betrayed his overlord leaders in the hopes of one day freeing his people earth quickly makes an enemy of the goa uld a parasitic race who use humans as hosts and think themselves equal to gods the top notch cast have much to be congratulated for in bringing this show to life richard dean anderson is perfect as the cynical and sarcastic o neill who can shift from boyish to deadly in the blink of an eye michael shanks as daniel brings heart and an will of steel to the character who has grown from wide eyed innocence to darker and more hard bitten as the show has progressed amanda tapping as carter has perfected the balance between depicting her character s femininity without comprising the fact she is a strong intelligent military scientist christopher judge is excellent as the aloof teal c who is able to depict the character s emotions with subtlety and don s davis is perfect as the esteemed general hammond who leads with a good balance of fairness and firmness almost all the episodes are are involving and portrayed with intelligence reflecting on moral dilemmas as well as the friction between military interests and civilian beliefs often shown through arguments between o neill and jackson guest characters are solidly depicted and story arcs are handled in a manner that doesn t bore viewers sg also excels in humour from o neill s wisecracks to episodes that are just wacky and odd sg has everything from action to drama to romance to suspense to the heartbreaking scenes of death it isn t just an excellent sci fi show but is an excellent show overall
farrah fawcett has spent the better part of her post angel s career confounding us with an occasional noteworthy acting performance sandwiched in between her playboy frolics and letterman escapades but when it comes down to it there s no denying that this girl can act far from a story of epic proportions this well done tv movie is gentle quiet and occasionally moving fawcett plays the wayward black sheep daughter come home only to find that she missed the last days of her mom s life as well as the funeral much to the chagrin of her more stable and presumably more sensible sister brad johnson plays the love interest and a story unfolds with all the typical elements of telefilm drama but then there s always that confounding farrah to watch and she does indeed remain eminently watchable and yes i admit it i did have that farrah poster on my wall way back when silk hope gets three and a half stars out of five on the corkymeter bosley would be proud
in a very short time the movie showed a boy s odd life of taking pictures showed his life and everyone else s get turned upside down as a result of his photographs then brought everything back to normal in the end one to see if you re looking for something interesting
it has said that the movies and baseball both thrived during the great depression it appears that the grim realities of a nation caught up in the aftermath of this economic disaster created a need for occasional relief for the populace a temporary escape could be found in the on going soap opera that is baseball likewise an occasional excursion of or hours into the darkened auditoriums of the cinema the presence of a radio in just about everyone s house hold kept depression era america at once attuned to world s events and provided many a drama and especially comedy shows for a pleasant interlude from harsh reality the literature of the time also flourished at all levels the juvenile reading habits helped to create the comic book as we know it what with all the fantastic characters and super exciting adventures but the comic book just did not magically appear all fully developed with all the colorful color pages all by itself there were mediums that were ancestral to them obviously the newspaper comic strip was one parent providing the visual narrative method of story telling the other direct ancestor was the pulp magazine the inexpensive prose story publications that carried a great deal of stories of the same adventure characters in on going though not necessarily serialized tales the pulp medium had been around for some decades and introduced us to edgar rice borrough s tarzan and johnston mcculley s zorro the s brought forth a bumper crop as feature characters like the shadow the avenger g s battle aces and the spider master of men all found their way to the news stands among many others one other was doc savage a full blooded super hero of the written story the covers of the pulps had perhaps the only picture of the hero possessing extraordinary strength super keen senses and a protean genius class intellect doc was the prototype super hero he also assembled of his former army buddies into a small free lancing team of adventurers each of them was an expert in a given field so we had a top rated chemist lawyer construction engineer electrical engineer geologist archaeologist paleontologist etc the doc savage stories were very popular in the s and s and were published into the middle s then they went into a hiatus for a good years then the brainstorm came about to repackage the old novels in new container the paperback book a fresh look to the cover art was introduced featuring a highly stylized series of paintings of a very muscular doc with a perpetually ripped shirt the re introduction proved to be highly successful with the publication of a title a month and for a while more soon there was a rumor of a doc savage movie but when by what producer well the venerable man of bronze was back on the news stands for over years before any real project got put together it was veteran stop action animator and producer of top special effects films geoprge pal who did the film along with warner brothers when doc savage man of bronze arrived in the movie houses it boasted of a well casted team of actors albeit a largely no name as far familiarity with the viewers with former tarzan of tv ron ely s nearly perfect casting in the lead up and coming beauty of a starlette pamela hensley in the female lead and veteran character paul wexler as the villainous captain seas no other name would have been recognized and just maybe that was a plus in this case the story does a fine job of both getting most of the audience acquainted with the incredible group and at the same time get a plot going use of narration by paul frees and short film clips are the method pursued to move the introduction along to the main body of the story from the very start there are hints that this story will go with the same sort of manufactured camp humor as the batman tv series some really great looking early scenes involving doc and the whole crew doing their individual specialties are thrown toward humor by the paul frees narration and the unexpected unlikely outcomes for example an experiment of doc s with a miniature rocket missile turns out to be part of a method of catching fish a small one at that the whole story unfolds like that hitting the viewer with a little camp every so often as to keep reminding us not to take it too seriously we are also puzzled about mr george pal s being the producer his last he who had been so well known for special effects surely a factor that could be put to good use in a sci fi action setting of the pulp character s world i can remember seeing it quite vividly mrs ryan deanna was in the hospital just having given birth to our nd child michelle our older girl jennifer was visiting her grandmother so after visiting hours were over in the maternity ward it was straight over to the old marquette theatre rd kedzie here in chicago having seen it and being a guy with a good familiarity with doc i was sort of let down by the final product i could accept a little of this camp business but would not have objected if mr pal would have seen fit to let it all hang out and have some real neat dinosaurs and volcanoes to give it all a little more pulp comic serial type excitement and yet the cast headed up by mr ely and the others made the whole film likable if not lovable the sets and locations were as far as we can see very much like those of a s serial or adventure flick which would be enjoyable to about anyone and maybe that s just what they were trying for with this doc savage man of bronze
a doctor and a policeman in new orleans have only hours to locate a killer infected with pneumonic plague an effective and classy little thriller directed by elia kazan that blends documentary realism with a race against time pulpy heartbeat set and filmed in and around new orleans panic in the streets is taken from the story quarantine some like em cold by edna and edward anhalt who won an oscar for original story it also boasts a fine ensemble cast that deliver top rate performances for their director in turn richard widmark bringing the method a year before marlon did for kazan in a streetcar named desire paul douglas jack palance as walter jack palance the wonderfully named zero mostel all get sweatily moody as the pursuers chase the pursued to halt the onset of a potential black death epidemic where the film scores its main suspense points is with kazan s astute ability to cut back and forth between the protagonists without altering the flow and mood of the piece from widmark s public health doctor with hypodermic needle in hand running around trying to locate the bad guys so he can do good to the bad guys themselves who are bemused as to why there is such a wide scale hunt for them the tension is stacked up to fever breaking point to which thankfully the final thirty minutes becomes a cracking piece of cinema with palance excelling as a nasty villain that ironically puts one in mind of widmark s own tommy udo from kiss of death three years prior it s an imaginative and intelligently written story one that cunningly links rats and criminals to being carriers of disease a blight on society as it were it s noirish elements such as paranoia blend nicely with its basic procedural thriller being while some memorable scenes are suitably cloaked by the stifling atmosphere that kazan has created although some of the early character psychologizing threatens to steer the film down some over talky based alleyway this definitely is a film worth staying with to the end not essential film noir and maybe not even essential kazan but certainly a highly recommended film that begs to be discovered by a new generation of film lovers and reappraised by the old guard who may have missed it back in the day
the most bizarre of the cinematic sub genres is the so called the great ladies of the grand guignol camp horror films which combined over the top melodrama with gothic thrills and always starred by seasoned and almost forgotten actress from hollywood golden age in unflattering roles of either long suffering victims or screeching evil harpies this genre provided them with an unusual acting showcase that allowed strut their stuff on the screen once again and win new generations of fans at expense of their glamorous images from yesterday what s the matter with helen is the last drop of this sub genre with stunning performances of both debbie reynolds and shelley winters as the troubled mothers of two convicted criminals who run away from their past to the sunny california in the s to open a talent school to milk out the eagerly mothers who want their daughters to be the next shirley temple in california debbie gets happiness clients tango tap dancing and a new love interest dennis weaver meanwhile shelley gets wacko with horrible flashbacks menacing anonymous calls menacing strangers menacing agnes moorehead as a radio evangelist cute little rabbits and an unfortunate encounter with an electric fan ouch the sloppy script penned by henry farrell the man who started all this genre with whatever happened to baby jane along with master director robert aldrich joan crawford and bette davis is full of plot holes red herrings and wasted opportunities that could had made this movie great the underlying themes of twisted motherhood with debbie and shelley s characters as failed mothers and the overbearing mommies of the child stars and obsessive female bonding debbie and shelley relationship and the fact that the few male characters of this movie are either sinister or sleazy even dennis weaver dream boat texan are wasted instead we get debbie reynolds musicals interludes and dancing tots although fun to watch take too much screen time of what is supposedly to be a psychological chiller but still this movie is highly entertaining the two stars and curtis harrington stylish direction easily overcomes its flaws the movie recreation of the s is colorful and elegant look at debbie s clothes made with a very tight budget the increasing atmosphere of madness and hysteria is genuinely creepy with a shocking finale that will haunt you for days and you wouldn t easily forget that silly goody goody song that runs through the movie either and seeing an increasingly mad shelley winters screw every one of debbie reynolds chances at happiness is a hoot to watch out of
vincente minnelli directed some of the most celebrated entertainments in cinema history he was among the first hollywood directors to show that a profound love of color motion and music might produce intelligent entertainment american in paris is the story of an ex gi who remains in france after the war to study and paint he falls in love with a charming gamine lise bourvier their romantic love affair sparkles as brightly as the city of lights itself the whole movie brings a touch of french elegance where technique artistic style and music all come together in perfect synchronism the first musical sequence introduces the exciting personality of leslie caron in her screen debut she is like a diamond a touch of class george guetary describes his fianc e ambiguous grace in a montage of different dance styles sweet and shy vivacious and modern graceful and awesome the number leads to an unpretentious bistro where kelly and his very good friends in paris share a gentle parody of viennese waltzes later kelly celebrates a popular tap dancing with a crowd of enthusiastic children singing with him i got rhythm and at the massive jazz nightclub kelly spots the girl of his dreams he is instantly hit by her sparkling sapphire blue eyes and only one clear thing is in his mind to pull lize onto the dance floor and sing to her it s very clear our love is here to stay to the joyful tra la la kelly provides humor wit and talent all around oscar levant s room and even on the top of his brown piano when he meets his pretty cinderella along the seine river kelly is swept away by his happy meeting with caron he expresses all his emotions with our love is here to stay the piece had a definite nighttime feel as the two lovers were bathed in soft blue smoky light they start an enchanting dance duet juxtaposing differing elements caron dances with her head on his shoulder then tries to run away in a fluid way they move backward away from each other then pause to rush toward each other for a little kiss and a warm hug the film s weakest numbers were those that bear little relation to the story in one georges guetary performs an entertaining stage show with showgirls in giant ornaments floating down to the stage in another oscar levant imagines himself conducting a concert and playing not only a piano recital but the other instruments as well he even applauds to himself as members of the audience the extravagant climactic super ballet of the film is quite an adventure a breakthrough in taste direction and design it is a blaze of love fury and vividness it is kelly s major fantasy of his lost love and of his feeling about paris as viewed through the huge backdrops of some of france s most impressionist painters the number starts at the beaux arts ball after kelly finds himself separated from lise and begins a sketch with a black crayon it gathers the important parts of the film s story through a constantly changing locations all in the style of the painters who have influenced jerry the tour richly attractive and superbly atmospheric includes the place de la concorde fountain the madeleine flower market the place de l op ra to his rendez vous at montmartre with the cancan dancers in a representation of lautrec s moulin rouge kelly seems to defy the boundaries of his physical self caron seems to dominate her space and sweeps you away to another time and place nina foch appeared very attractive and elegant in her one shouldered white gown in one of the film s most famous lines kelly asks her that s quite a dress you almost have on what holds it up nina cleverly replies modesty an american in paris garnered six oscars including an honorary award to gene kelly the film gave us a wealth of memories to take home
as a former time okinawan karate world champion i like movies about sacrifice for sport but this movie is about so much more this movie is so good and so deep i have recently been plagued by very serious injury and pretty much a disastrous lack of passion almost lights out for me and this silly little movie touched me so deep that like out of a daze it reminded me about what life is supposed to be about this is a movie about living living your life for yourself and respect for others empowerment god bless bend it like beckham i believe it is a true gem
perhaps this could be the best movie ever made and if it s not it s certainly one of those who are burned onto your pupils as what brian de palma delivers here is a great piece of cinematographic artwork first there is the director s touch of brian de palma who proves once again he might be one of the best directors ever there is the superb performance from al pacino who is delivering an immortal hero on the big screen tony montana there are the many different violent scenes that you will never forget the one with the chainsaw the one in where tony is sitting in a bath which is as big as most people s living rooms there are the many superb one liners count how many times the word f ck is used there are the superb little details the pan american globe that screams the world is yours or the great discomusic from giorgio moroder nothing can be named that isn t sublime here and it easily is along with the godfather good fellas and white heat one of the best gangstermovies ever made

where the sidewalk ends opens appropriately with dana andrews and gene tierneys names inscribed on the sidewalk as dirty water streams down between the bars of a sewer grate the sidewalk represents respectability integrity and morality only crooks and delinquents walk in the gutter but even the most honourable of men have a tendency to misstep on occasion and when the sidewalk abruptly comes to an end sometimes it proves impossible to avoid getting one s shoes wet mark dixon dana andrews was born in the gutter his father a professional criminal and has spent his entire life clawing his way back onto the sidewalk perpetually balanced on the edge of the kerb as a police detective dixon wants nothing more than to display the decency and integrity that his father lacked but he possesses a mean streak that he can t escape when his quick temper leaves a murder suspect dead dixon finds himself becoming the very father whom he despised a cheap criminal who ll cheat and lie to cover up his offence where the sidewalk ends was the only film to reunite dana andrews gene tierney and director otto preminger after the superb laura though the two films as far as noir goes couldn t be further apart whereas the earlier picture had the strong intimacy of a country house murder tale this film is more conventional as a gritty urban police drama given her ravishingly memorable performance as laura hunt it s unfortunate that here tierney is grossly underused occupying the typical niche of the pretty helpless romantic interest much as she did that same year in jules dassin s the night and the city andrews on the other hand has rarely been better exhibiting a toughness and unhinged anger that i hadn t expected of him gary merrill is suitably smug as the crime boss scalise but he doesn t seem mean enough for the role and i think that an actor like richard conte who played mr brown in the big combo would have better suited the character i hadn t realised this but conte appeared just one year earlier in preminger s whirlpool the tension as dixon attempts to cover up his accidental crime is absolutely riveting certainly among the most suspenseful sequences of its era though i feel that the situation still wasn t exploited to its full potential the taxi driver is the only person who could have decisively identified dixon as the perpetrator but preminger hurriedly skims over the moment when he passes dixon on the stairs had the witness been brought in as dixon was re enacting his own movements outside the apartment entrance we could have had some genuine fireworks and why for that matter couldn t the taxi driver s testimony have immediately absolved jiggs taylor tom tully from suspicion of murder niggling inconsistencies such as these tarnish an otherwise excellent screenplay from ben hecht who infuses his gritty criminal underworld with hard hitting cops and wise cracking felons andrews seething and implosive law enforcer tormented by rage and remorse has rarely been done better at least the equal of robert ryan in nicholas ray s on dangerous ground
a great film this and a shame that it will receive little attention outside of arthouse circles and students who stay up until two in the morning to watch it on channel four the plot is a simple one but works very effectively the blurring between child like fantasy and hard hitting nightmare is very well blurred the budget looks pretty low but to the credit of those involved it doesn t show too often it also hasn t dated that much either i was lucky enough to tape this off the telly when it was on a few years ago and it has withstood half a dozen viewings it s one of those films that won t appeal to all though as usual those with a more thoughtful approach to cinema would get a lot out of this charlotte buerke puts in a good performance as anna the spoilt brat and it is a shame she seems to have gone from the acting scene cross is also very good carrying the stature of his character very well within the context of the picture there are some genuinely and i don t say that lightly disturbing moments in this film both half second shockers and more drawn out tensions watch it with the lights out highly recommended
the three stooges has always been some of the many actors that i have loved i love just about every one of the shorts that they have made i love all six of the stooges curly shemp moe larry joe and curly joe all of the shorts are hilarious and also star many other great actors and actresses which a lot of them was in many of the shorts in my opinion the three stooges is some of the greatest actors ever and is the all time funniest comedy team one of my favorite stooges shorts with shemp is none other than husbands beware all appearing in this short are the beautiful christine mcintyre dee green doris houck alyn lockwood johnny kascier nancy saunders lu leonard maxine gates and emil sitka green and mcintyre provide great performances here there are so many funny parts here this is a very hilarious short there is another similar three stooges short like this one called brideless groom and i recommend both
i first encountered this show when i was staying in japan for six months last year i found it in the internet when i was looking for sub titled dramas to help me with my japanese my host mother warned me to stay away from it because she thought it was weird but i found it delightful koyuki showed such conflicting character traits and matsujun s spirit made my day every time i tuned in i first saw him on hana yori dango but i liked him much better in this although the characters are interesting and well developed i was disappointed to find that they didn t change very much throughout the show their relationship grew but they didn t really still a fun time had by all even for fukushima
back in i had a really lengthy vacation around the fourth of july something like days off in a row what with two weeks paid vacation weekends and the holiday itself i stayed in town during that time hanging out at my parents house a lot i didn t have a tv in my apartment so i used to watch my parents tube i had just finished watching a segment of the x files when a program came on called personal fx i was hooked instantly i had always been fascinated with items in our home that had come from my parents family homes and through inheritances from relatives estates and often wondered about their history value etc after my long vacation i used to go to my folks house on my lunch hours just to catch personal fx i can remember one episode during which co host claire carter announced that the new york apartment in which the series was filmed was being renovated and that once said renovations were complete that personl fx would return to the air it never did personal fx was the first and best of the collectible shows and it vanished from the air almost fifteen years later i m still sore way to go fx
only saw this show a few times but will live in my memory it is very frustrating that it is so difficult to find this anywhere to purchase and yet there seem to be endless repeats of stuff like friends especially even more difficult to obtain being in england i guess they say it was low ratings or was it a complaint from the bakersfield pd themselves maybe it was just too clever for certain people anyhow just about the one comedy i would love to see again but is almost impossible to find i hear it is being or has been repeated on another network but alas not over here summary ingenious
i cannot accept the negative comments of other reviewers they are too critical perhaps because they are stuck in the past i would like to see a comment from someone who had never seen basic instinct perhaps someone very young i left the cinema feeling glad that i had not been swayed by the imdb reviewers hours later i am still trying to find flaws in the plot but i cannot think of anything serious my advice to everyone is see it for yourself and make up your own mind it follows a similar pattern to basic instinct but the plot is less confused it still left me wondering at the end but in a more satisfactory way sharon stone is as sexy and evil as before and wears her years extremely well this remains her defining role david morrisey was satisfactory even though he is no michael douglas of the supporting cast i particularly liked david thewlis as the police detective
the sunshine boys is a terrific comedy about two ex vaudevillians who reluctantly reunite for a tv special despite the fact that they despise each other the comic genius of two masters at work george burns and walter matthau are stellar some of the best scenes are when the duo is fighting over the silliest little trivial things the material is fast paced and witty appealing to all ages mild spoiler alert there are some mildly sad moments toward the end of the movie that deal indirectly with the affects of aging that gives the film a soft sincere tenderness that shows to this reviewer that what the pair really need the most for success are each other if anyone loves the odd couple you ll adore this movie an excellent film
i really liked this summerslam due to the look of the arena the curtains and just the look overall was interesting to me for some reason anyways this could have been one of the best summerslam s ever if the wwf didn t have lex luger in the main event against yokozuna now for it s time it was ok to have a huge fat man vs a strong man but i m glad times have changed it was a terrible main event just like every match luger is in is terrible other matches on the card were razor ramon vs ted dibiase steiner brothers vs heavenly bodies shawn michaels vs curt hening this was the event where shawn named his big monster of a body guard diesel irs vs kid bret hart first takes on doink then takes on jerry lawler and stuff with the harts and lawler was always very interesting then ludvig borga destroyed marty jannetty undertaker took on giant gonzalez in another terrible match the smoking gunns and tatanka took on bam bam bigelow and the headshrinkers and yokozuna defended the world title against lex luger this match was boring and it has a terrible ending however it deserves
this project was originally conceived as the movie version of popular japanese manga slamdunk and that s not something new to jay chou who made his movie debut playing a character from another wildly popular manga initial d along the way it was decided to incorporate some kung fu into the movie so hence the title even if the idea wasn t very original with stephen chow s shaolin soccer coming to mind with martial arts and ball games combined however and thankfully those scenes where kung fu actually influenced the games were kept to a bare minimum and in kung fu dunk really quite unnecessary because they don t add much to the plot nor drum up much excitement and at most offered some cheap laughs and reminisced about the time when stephen chow used kung fu in football games jay chou is comfortable in his role as a martial artist fang shi jie since it s not the first time he fought using martial arts curse of the golden flower anyone and under the stunt direction of ching siu tung he was made to look really believable as he trashes countless of gangsters in a bar as seen in the trailer just to let you know who s boss that was almost why his character is made a kung fu practitioner and for the fact of giving him an excuse for being a top shot able to shoot the hoops from practically any angle and with eric tsang as a small time hustler chen li who sees his potential and becomes his agent he joins a university to play varsity basketball but not without the initial objection of team captain ting wei chen bo lin and team star xiao lan baron chen in his big screen debut but you know with team members on the same side it s not before long they combine their strengths to take on adversaries on the basketball court and i will stick my neck out to say that this movie is to basketball just as how goal was to football it made the sport look good because of its charismatic characters despite them dripping so much coolness and aloofness on the courts here special effects and wire work were employed to make the actors seem like professionals who can take out a top side in the nba league and in all honesty really looked stunning especially when they mimic various dunking moves and performing combo moves thanks to technology and stunt work so in actuality the kung fu elements don t really have to be in the movie the stunt work itself will be able to justify most of the moves as they re quite grounded to reality only having you to suspend belief that boys of average height have springs in their feet to leap that height for a professional dunk pity too that the number of games were only a handful with the time spent on plenty of subplots but each were loosely developed and flitted in and out of the story as and when they please things like the abandoned shi jie s quest to use the basketball games to get his parents to one day attend them that of gangsterism penetrating and influencing games and his love life with charlene choi in yet another flower vase role just to look good and do nothing else everyone s acting a little too cool leaving little room for main characters to add depth one of the key themes here is the realization of the importance of teamwork rather than on individual talent and ability and it could have been brought out much stronger if the players themselves interacted a lot more off the court than only on it and during competitive games apart from the high fives and friendly passes with the us million budget it is easy to see where the money went to the effects in particular a massive fantasy sequence at a crucial point in the movie it s quite flawless nice to look at and probably justifiable on its quality alone but again i like to emphasize that even without those elements the basketball stunts itself would still make this a decent movie with nifty basketball moves and having jay chou playing for your team is a big boost to any hopes of a box office success
i stumbled on this late last night n tcm hadn t seen it since it came out originally but had never forgotten it i had completely forgotten how gorgeous and talented signe hasso was when she was still young ditto for shelly winters before she balooned out ronald coleman though was the quintessential state actor of his time i had read othello in high school english and hated it after seeing a double life i read it again and finally understood what the play was about the gordon kanin writing team was at its peak when this script was done a movie well worth remembering and rewatching
good show very entertaining good marshal arts acting good story plot the entire main crew did a nice job from robert urich to chuck norris jennifer tung and especially a big hand to judson mills an especially fine tribute to robert urich in his latter days a great actor who will be truly missed
this game is amazing really you should get it if you don t have it although it is ancient now it was amazing when it came out i believe that this game will always be a classic it s just as good a super mario world or so when i was young my friend and i would sit and play this game for hours trying to beat it which we eventually did it s not nearly as advanced as super mario galaxy but if you are a fellow mario fan it is essential it s fun entertaining and challenging everything you could want out of a fantasy game except for good graphics well it did come out in rock on eva mario luigi and yoshi nintendo is the best
penny princess finds american working girl yolande donlon the inheritor of a small kingdom that lies in that triangle where france italy and switzerland meet called lampidorra it seems as though the lampidorrans owe bills all over europe and the main occupation of the country is smuggling due to its geography an american multi millionaire buys the place but dies before he can take title his nearest heir is donlan but of course the estate has to go through probate in america and what are the lampidorrans to do especially since donlan who has now become a princess has forbade smuggling enter dirk bogarde who is on a trip to switzerland to learn about the cheese industry it seems as though the lampidorrans have a kind of cheese that they playfully refer to as schmeeze with a few bumps in the road schmeeze solves all the problems both financial geopolitical and romantic between donlan and bogarde how does schmeeze work well that s the gimmick to the whole film but here s a hint in lover come back jack kruschen might just have gotten a hold of the secret of schmeeze when he was busy inventing vip for rock hudson and his advertising agency anyway penny princess is a delightful blend of british farce and romantic comedy yolande donlon once again plays a role that marilyn monroe would have been cast in if the film had been made this side of the pond dirk bogarde was well cast in the part which was at the beginning of his career as a romantic heart throb way before anyone but him suspected he had the acting chops he had this film was sadly shown at three o clock in the morning on tcm but at least i found a reason to be grateful for insomnia
scarface has a major cult following even now years after its release it has also been widely criticized as being very tacky unrefined over the top and all bloated up these are people who compare scarface to the godfather movies it is true that on the technical front cinematography screenplay direction etc scarface is way behind the godfather but it is also true that what scarface has and some other gangster movies lack is the rawness the sheer crude approach of the gangsters the latino gangsters in this movie look much more menacing and real than any of the polished italian or irish gangsters from other gangster classics like the godfather or goodfellas this is one of the major winning points of scarface and i strongly believe that this fact has been written off as tackiness by most critics i have seen the original scarface and i must say that both these movies are way too different from each other and should be seen as two different movies instead of praising the original over the remake al pacino has been criticized to be over the top and loud in this movie but how about considering that that is precisely the way the film makers wanted tony montana s character to be he is this angry young man who takes hasty decisions and throws fits of tantrum every other minute he is not the calm michael corleone here he is tony montana a very tacky uneducated individual who doesn t really think much and gets angry all the time there is definitely a very s feel to this movie the soundtrack is all s i love some of the songs including gina and elvira s theme push it to the limit and the title track instrumental there are some memorable and beautifully shot sequences including the famous chainsaw scene the rebenga hit the first meeting with sosa and tony s visit to his mother s about the performances al pacino is brilliant as the angry cuban refugee he has reportedly mentioned that he enjoyed playing tony montana the most in his entire career and it really does seem like he has enjoyed himself thoroughly in all his scenes one wonders what scarface would be like without pacino i just couldn t imagine anyone else portraying tony montana and in all probabilities the film wouldn t be as effective without him steven bauer shines as tony s friend manny robert loggia is wonderful as tony s boss lopez so is f murray abraham as omar in a small role then there is some eye candy in the form of elvira played by michelle pfeiffer she looks beautiful and is adequate in her role the director does go a bit overboard during a particular part in the climax without revealing anything i would only say that that was the only little part that suffers due to improper handling scarface is definitely one of the most entertaining and one of the best gangster movies to ever come out enjoy it for what it is a raw portrayal of the drug lords and their gangland
after the glories of the snare it was unlikely that a further outing for hanzo would be able to do any better and this doesn t breach that expectation but it is a fine film and sits neatly in between the fun but messy first chapter and the terrific second in terms of quality and general entertainment the screenplay comes from yasuzo masumura and has some parallels with the snare as well as the expected hi jinks of a hanzo film but the film rings nice little changes on the formula by amping up the character driven humour as well as giving the film a quieter reflective edge the film opens with hanzos assistants scared by a ghost and typically he decides straight away that he needs to have carnal knowledge of this ghost it turns out that the ghost is serving as a guard for a stash of stolen coins and from this set up unfolds a story of theft corruption and usury with expected violent and sleazy results shintaro katsu is terrific as expected as hanzo coming across effortlessly as a deadly fighter and sexual force of nature he is equally good in the moments of knowing humour and likable almost an ordinary gentleman in moments of drama it is a beautifully rounded performance filled with social conscience and a touching edge of personal feeling the expected comedy comes off fine as well his moments with snake magobei are perhaps the most amusing of the series whilst his interactions with his servants are kookily entertaining as ever though neatly laden throughout with nice moments a fair amount of action and a little sleaze the film does lose a little from a relatively restrained approach there are shades of both prior films the plotting pace and smarts recall the snare and when the film aims for sleaze it does very well with a potently handled and impactful early interrogation sequence equally though director yoshio inoue presents potentially sleazy scenes in a more experimental way as per kenji misumi s less well handled work in sword of justice with consequences sometimes very nice as with a man playing a tune on the koto with close ups of his fingers plucking at the strings as unbeknownest to him hanzo ploughs his wife and sometimes a bit weak as with an orgy that is reduced to a nudity free psychedelic whirl of limbs in motion that just looks confusing the nudity and bloodshed is generally downplayed which is a pity though there is a little of both a stronger approach would have worked better it is definitely the sort of film where trashy and unrestrained nudity and violence are most appropriate but even with less in the way of exploitative goods this is still thoroughly entertaining stuff the predictable moments are wrought with aplomb and there is more than enough intrigue and excitement even some effective surprises to go around its a film for the fans really playing off the work laid down in the previous instalments and working sweetly if not spectacularly with it altogether a near wholly pleasurable if mildly flawed end to a delightful trilogy the second best of them and well worth a watch for enthusiasts of such things
an interesting look at japan prior to opening to the west john wayne as america s first consul to japan arrives in accordance with agreements resulting from perry s gunboat diplomacy he is not welcome wayne eventually wins his meeting with the shogun after bring a cholera epidemic introduced by an american ship under control there follows a colorful procession to the capital bearing gifts for the shogun including a bottle of old tanglefoot the meeting with the shogun the debates among the japanese nobles and an assassination during an archery exhibit present an interesting look at the politics of the period altogether a rather enjoyable movie and besides how often do you get to see the duke lose a fight to a guy half his size
i definitely recommend reading the book prior to watching the film this book won national book council award in and is a very gripping read pun not intended it s not too difficult to read for those out there that don t read often so don t be afraid the book seems to capture the passion of the relationships more so than the movie and the movie will make more sense after reading the book having grown up in melbourne i could really relate to this book and movie very few australian female writers were around the in the s therefore very little is documented about the way of life for a women in an urban city in australia during this era or class it s a precious piece of melbourne history it s a shame that it is documented as some sort of s soft porn movie it s far from that and as the other reviewer has mentioned please do not read the dvd jacket it does not represent what the movie is about at all those that rent the movie based on this description will only be disappointed just remember this movie was made in so don t expect the hollywood over dramatization that they seem to incorporate these days this is what i like about it it s also great seeing noni hazlehurst in this role she is just fantastic as nora and it s great watching her really acting for if you re close to my age you will best remember her for her stints on playschool and better homes and gardens who knew she hid this talent this movie will give you an entirely new impression of her a classic australian story
i understand this film to be a debut feature and as such it is very impressive it has the feel and pacing of a true indie yet director todd yellin clearly possesses the photographic and editorial vision command and judgment of a mature and seasoned professional the shots are well framed and thought out and serve to move the story forward he and screenwriter ivan solomon deliver a story that has much more depth and lyricism than typical paint by numbers type scripts it s a story that needs judd hirsch caliber character talent to have a shot at working judd is fantastic as usual as are scott cohen and the beautiful susan floyd the real surprise though is elliot korte who plays adam groden yellin was able to coax nuance out of the young actor in a role that could have been easily devalued by stereotype or overreach anyway i found the film refreshing and entertaining
i barely remember this show a little but i remembered it was great my eldest brother reminded me about the show recently and i had seen an advertisement for the d v d set coming out the network again screwed up in pulling this from the air so that they could put what else in it s place it should have gone at least seasons why not right i think sometimes that the network executives think they are the gods of the entertainment world but they mis guess and flat out miss good show placement from time to time let it be said that they have a lot more flops than hits this was one of the poor decisions to cut from the line up anyhow i am getting this for my collection
this film provides the saga of a legendary wild bill hickock he buffalo bill cody and calamity jane are the central characters as the civil war closes lincoln mentions his concern that the country s dynamism would be enhanced if people would follow the advice go west young man which mercifully the film didn t erroneously attribute to horace greeley as a number of others did but then he gets assassinated and some financiers speculate that they can get rich selling weapons to the american indians in the meantime we see wild bill hickock who interacts with a small boy while a steamboat is loading at a dock along the mississippi wild bill uses a bowie knife which he eventually gives to the boy calling it an arkansas toothpick which in reality was a different type of knife though both were used throughout the frontier hickock eventually meets buffalo bill cody who looks close to the photographs and paintings of the actual man cody has just gotten married and is bringing his bride to the old west to settle down when they arrive at their destination they run into calamity jane who has a crush on hickock she looks at cody s wife and asks buffalo bill is this your mopsy the line was one that caused the hayes board some problem since one definition of mopsy was prostitute demille wanted the line in and one of his aides pointed out that in beatrix potter s books about peter rabbit three of the rabbits were flopsy mopsy and cottontail he pointed this out and asked the censors to identify the rabbit of ill virtue it worked the line stayed in the indians were getting restless in part because of the superior weaponry they got from the agent of the eastern financiers cody and hickock were asked to help scout the area so that troops could get safely through to a beleaguered area cody led the troops hickock went to check out the activities of an indian chief who was an old acquaintance and who was leading some of the hostile indians calamity jane gets captured and hickock gets captured trying to save her they are brought to the chief and although neither would talk torture applied to hickock breaks calamity jane s willpower and she tells the route cody is using the two are released and hickock joins up with cody and his forces in part to alert them they re walking into a trap with hickok s help they hold off the indian attack hickock decides to go after the gun runners and finally takes them prisoner as they re waiting for authorities hickock is gunned down by being shot in the back while playing cards there are numerous historic anomalies in the film but it retains the flavor of legend pretty good for the s
scoop is easily woody allen s funniest film of the s so far allen although finally looking his age is at the top of his game as low brow magician sidney waterman his one liners and demeanor are hilarious don t let the critics sway your opinion scoop is a top notch woody lite picture the classical music score is an excellent compliment to the action on screen scarlett johanson looks gorgeous in that bathing suit jackman is dashing the cinematography glows scoop is wonderful escapist fare from start to finish the last shot of the film alone is worth the admission price
one of my favorite movies which has been overlooked by too many movie goers an observation which mystifies me not only directed by the acclaimed ang lee it had many young actors who were to become major stars e g tobey maguire before spiderman skeet ulrich before jericho jonathan rhys meyers before tudors james caviezel simon baker mark ruffalo jeffrey wright tom wilkinson and jewel all of the acting was superb and each of the actors mentioned gave memorable performances especially meyers who portrayed an evil villain who killed for the sake of killing when the biographies and accomplishments of the director even when he won an academy award and the actors are listed this film is usually omitted from their past performances i discovered the film on dvd by accident and it became one of my most often watched films however it is seldom every seen on cable i look forward to reading what others suggest are the reasons this film is not well known
this is my fourth joe mcdoakes short that i ve seen and so far the funniest one in this one joe takes voice lessons from a record impersonating charles boyer and ronald colman when he goes to warner bros studio the company behind this series incidentally he asks jack carson for directions which gets both confused then he encounters actor george o hanlon who s also mcdoakes who speaks in his more normal voice that s not too far from his later geroge jetson and gets to the set where he automatically upsets the director i ll stop there and just say how funny i found the whole thing and was fascinated by the movie star cameos provided near the end the final scene was especially a hoot so on that note go to youtube if you want to watch so you want to be in picutres
this was obviously the prototype for mick dundee but the adventures of barry mckenzie is funnier i was amused throughout and laughed out loud plenty of times terrific central performance by barry crocker in the title role an australian who invades england to upset the poms with his free flowing uncouth ways few brits will be upset by barry s frequently cruel observations on his hosts the relationsip between the two countries is prickly but friendly and this is highlighted by the film s final line delivered by a somewhat reluctant mckenzie as he boards the plane home i was just starting to like the poms
i still liked it though warren beatty is only fair as the comic book hero what saves this movie is the set the incredible cast and it offshoots a mediocre script i really expected something more substantial in the terms of action or plot but i got very little the main reason to watch this movie is to watch some of the biggest stars in hollywood at the time in such an unusual film the one person who did a terrible job and did not even belong in this film was madonna she did not belong in this movie and her acting job was pretty bad the movie at some points just stood still you expected something more and you got nothing al pacino plays a really bad dude and he does pretty good he and beatty do make an excellent good guy and bad guy it is also interesting to see dustin hoffman and warren beatty in a film other than isthar i did not see ishtar but i heard bad things the thing about this movie is it is good but it could have been so much better i liked it as a child because i thought it looked cool and visually the movie is amazing the sets are incredible the writing is only fair and with such a cast in the movie i would expect a little better anyway spoileri especially thought the finale was not big enough it was interesting but for such a grand scale film i just thought it could have ended with a little more of a bang the reason to watch this movie is the atmosphere the movie only uses the comic book colors making it all that more excellent visually anyway the costumes and makeup were flawless as well the facial makeup for the villains was great beatty is just not up to such a bigger than life character still this is a good movie that could have been much much more it is to me better than batman the other comic book adaptation that came out close to the same time of course that movie was much bigger in terms of gross
this is sad this movie is the tops this should at least be in the top movies here this is still the best action movie ever done the action movies of today are badly done the actors and action directors do not no how to do it fighting and stunts properly only some no how to do it mostly from hong kong like jackie chan the stunts are so clever and wild i do not think we will see the likes of ever the start where chan and his team go down the hill car chase through the hill town is just amazing the end fight stunts are for me the best fight stunts ever put to film the end stunt sliding down the pole crashing through the glass jackie was badly hurt
i have not read the novel or anything other by kurt vonnegut but i am now intending to start this grips you from the very first frame and does not let go until the end credits start rolling taking you places you don t expect the plot is interesting throughout the pacing is spot on nothing lasts too long and this does a perfect job of balancing between unexpected twists and allowing the viewer to process what we ve seen it is well told and well thought out i ve never watched a film that i feel i could particularly compare this to it is intense and exciting as well as funny and sad the acting is excellent nolte absolutely shines goodman again proves that he doesn t have to go for laughs and lee and arkin are spellbinding i could go on really no role is treated to a less than stellar performance the editing and cinematography are marvelous and all of the visuals are great with a couple of unforgettable and astonishing ones i am going to go for other movies directed by keith gordon as well as the other two apparently related to this through the author of the books there is one scene of sexuality and a lot disturbing and unsettling content in this i recommend this to anyone who can appreciate it it is not pleasant
good story and excellent animation the influence of frazetta and bakshi are obvious and that s a good thing anyone that enjoys conan the barbarian or the game dungeons and dragons should enjoy it the battle between good and evil is clear cut even though it may appear that at times our hero is neutral most often in fantasy movies elves are usually portrayed as having white skin and blond hair and goblins and orcs have dark skin and hair anyone familiar with frazetta s bakshi s or even tolkien s work know they are not racist anyone that enjoys fantasy movies should like this movie it is not for young children due to violence and sexual innuendo the casting was well done and the scenes and music are first rate i hope someone puts this gem on dvd soon i consider myself lucky to have a vhs copy in good condition
i liked this film very much the story jumps back and forth quite a bit and is not easy to follow there is no resolution to the story whatsoever and you are left to wonder what really happened since i like that sort of film i enjoyed this i especially like the dating scenes between the boys and i was drawn into their lives and of course any film with a naked staphane rideau will get a couple of extra points
i liked this movies its a another yash raj film which you know will look good on screen all character are always nice or very nice with one exception who you know will eventually covert to being nice another rule of yash raj s film is that either hero or heroine s have only one or none parent think back to all of those films mpk suman didn t have mom hmapk salman didn t have parents and final rule is that you are likely to see alock nath crying the film is good too its a bit slow at first but keeps you entertained there is almost no comedy but it does make you smile often enough the little kid hero s nephew is well placed and deliver very good one liners the actress is very pretty but shy you wouldn t get that in real life this film doesn t have massively big happy families living in big house which i thou was a good idea and allowed the film to be differentiated from other films there will be lots of women crying at the end of the film there isn t a strong message from this film but its a good watch if you are married arranged marriage the film will remind you of what you went through and if you are not it will inform and may be scare you overall a very good looking film no big plots or twists but a very gentle film very much like bollywood classic
eye in the labyrinth is not your average giallo and to be honest i m not really sure that it really is a giallo but giallo or not despite some problems this is certainly a very interesting little film i m hesitant to call it a giallo because the film doesn t feature most of the things that make these films what they are but many genre entries break the mould and this would seem to be one of them the film doesn t feature any brutal murders as many giallo s do but this is made up for with a surreal atmosphere and a plot just about confusing enough to remain interesting for the duration the plot seems simple enough in that it focuses on a doctor who is murdered by julie his patient who for some reason she sees him as her lover and father and is offended when he walks out on her we then relocate to a big house lived in by a number of people but nothing is really what it seems as there are a number of secrets surrounding various events that happened before julie s arrival the film seems to be professing something about how the mind is like a labyrinth this never really comes off and i preferred to just sit back and enjoy what was going on rather than worrying about what point if any the film is trying to make eye in the labyrinth is directed by mario caiano the director behind the excellent night of the doomed some years earlier he doesn t create the atmosphere as well in this film as he did in the earlier one but the surreal aspects of the story come off well and the mystery is always kept up which stops the film from becoming boring the film stars rosemary dexter who provides eye candy throughout and also delivers a good performance most of the rest of the cast aren t really worth mentioning with the exceptions of adolfo celi who is good as the villain of the piece and alida valli whom cult fans will remember from a whole host of excellent cult flicks the film does explain itself at the end which is lucky as i m sure i m not the only viewer who was more than a little confused by then overall this may not be classic stuff but its good enough and worth seeing
acting this film is a very well acted film i will say that the performances are slightly weak at times but for the most part the acting is very good the only actor that blew me away with his performance was jude law as harlen maguire he was incredible tom hanks seemed alittle unsure at at a few points throughout the film but he too was incredible paul newman good as always cinematography this is what made the movie a masterpiece and i rarely use that word conrad hall is a true genius if at any point in the movie you were to pause it you will see the delicately crafted work of this man he sets up every shot so that nothing is left out when the camera is still there is a postcard like quality to the screen when the camera is moving every shot is planned to understated perfection but it doesn t stop there conrads choice of colors and contrast between light and dark settings is a work of art the way he lights the set is some of the most amazing lighting work i ve seen his work on this movie made it what it is this movie is at the top of the list for best cinematography with lotr black hawk down hero cthd moulin rouge and vertigo story people will say this movie is a s gangster flick but i believe they missed the point of the movie it is a love story about a hit man who fails in trying to protect his son from the life he chose it is a brilliantly crafted story that unfolds into a beautiful bond between two people who have nothing but each other the screen writing is worthy of an oscar music thomas newman conducts a sad but hopeful score to intensify this sad but hopeful story the music is some of the most beautiful and moving scores i ve herd direction sam mendes is a new director with a feel of an experienced director the symbols he uses and the performances he gets from his actors is a rarity in todays film making world i will be on the lookout for the next sam mendes film one of the most moving and beautiful movies i ve ever seen
this is one of my all time favorites it is so simple and sweet definitely a chick flick romantic comedy i really like a film full of good quotes and this has it one of my favorites is when albert einstein says to ed walters are you thinking what i m thinking and ed says now what are the odds of that happening in my opinion a film is fabulous if you can watch it again and again and get the same amount of enjoyment out of it and with this one you can i also really enjoyed walter m s way of portraying einstein i think all the characters fit together really well and the story flows nicely there are so many times that i find myself smiling right along with the film and quoting my favorite lines as i watch it i would recommend this movie to anyone who has a heart and enjoys a feel good romantic comedy now and then
i would imagine that if steve mcqueen knew he would go on to become an icon and start wanted dead of alive the same year this film came out or be in the magnificent seven two years later he would not have done it but he did and we are the richer for it sure it s a camp classic horror the way it was meant to be for the drive in theater it s fun and nostalgic it is interesting that the last lines of the film were lieutenant dave at least we ve got it stopped steve andrews yeah as long as the arctic stays cold they never would have imagined years ago that the arctic would be thawing the blob will soon return
no awards show can please all the people clearly if your favorite movies didn t win you will say the show wasn t very good that s understandable however the th annual academy awards will be remembered for one magical moment of hollywood history woody allen s first appearance ever at the academy awards allen has often shunned the awards as being self aggrandizing and pointless and has never attended even though he has won several of the coveted awards when the th academy awards were held the nation was still mourning the loss of life in the collapse of the world trade centers in new york when it came time to pay tribute to the city of new york they decided to show a video of the great movie moments form the city of cities then the announcer simply said ladies and gentleman oscar award winning director woody allen the place erupted in an extremely long standing ovation the entertainment industry finally got to give their applause to the man from new york who usually avoids the hollywood scene as the applause died down woody applied some of his legendary wit to the situation some highlights thank you very much that makes up for the strip search i thought they wanted their oscars back he joked i panicked because the pawn shop has been out of business for ages and i had no way of retrieving anything but that wasn t it i couldn t work it out because my movie wasn t nominated for anything this year then it hit me maybe they were calling to apologise allen also disclosed why he had overlooked his lifelong oscar aversion for this one special night for new york city i d do anything so i got my tux on and came down here said allen it s a great great movie town it s been a great moving and exciting backdrop for movies and it remains a great great city
one thing i can say about this movie is well long very long i actually recently purchased this movie a couple of months ago seeing that there was a new version coming out i was happy to find that it was made in because the s even though i never lived in them is actually one of my favourite decades especially for the music when i watched this movie the story was actually very good at the start but then after about mins it started to get very boring and repetitive i will admitt the animation did impress me it was nothing i had ever seen before and was well pretty cool to see but the movie honestly could of been a bit better it could of had alot more talking and story to it than just to minute scenes that just had wierd fighting then for the last or minutes the movie picked up and got good again but ended unexpectedly in my opinion i thought it was extremely long i know its minutes over hours and that is still long for a cartoon but since it was boring for most of the movie it made it seem like it was hours long but overall it is an okay film i guess and i will watch it again on one of those nothing to do days i will see the new one and i hope it is better
they re not jawing journalists cary grant and rosalind russell from his girl friday or witty detective william powell and sassy lady myrna loy from thin man but woody allen and scarlett johansson are surprisingly charming as amateur sleuths in scoop their screwball repartee is more postmodern than post depression allen s writing filled with ironic self deprecation and plain old new york angst shades of the old wit occur rarely such as when he as sid the great splendini magician responds about his background i was born into the hebrew persuasion but when i got older i converted to narcissism johansson fresh from allen s match point as a bad girl here gets to be a relatively good sometimes ditsy journalism student caught in a murder mystery suitable for london a serial killer the plot is a reworking of his recent london based thriller match point right down to the upper class sins and the american tragedy place in the sun boating accident as a matter of fact allen is reworking manhattan murder mystery and purple rose of cairo to name just a couple of other examples i care not if he reworks i would like the new material to be at least the equal of the originals and alas it is just a reflection of his younger greatness allen as director and actor can t hide his love for the actress as he couldn t for diane keaton and therefore takes a middling comedy into an appropriate place down the allen canon not great but amusing at times brilliantly satirical about the suspected upper class murderer sid allen quips i d be very surprised if he killed one person this is vintage allen humor while there are barely any bright literary allusions as in most of his film he lards scoop with music from grieg tchaikovsky and strauss to let us know the woodman has not lost his touch of class
i love sabrina its one of my fave shows my favourite episodes are the one where she turns libby into a geek the first episode the true love episode and most of the rest from the first series i do think the college episodes were not as good as the high school ones but they were better than the last series which was awful valerie was a good character as she was more rounded than jenny but jenny was in some brilliant episodes hilda and zelda were amazing and there seemed to be no explanation for where they went libby was a good character too i never liked morgan or roxy they just weren t as good as her other friends
erroll works for the department of public safety and his job is to check up on sex offenders sometimes he pushes the line at his job and beats on the sex offenders i don t blame him but his boss is ready for him to retire so along comes allison erroll is now training her to do his job and it s like job shadowing allison is somewhat naive about the job in the beginning but she doesn t realize how much danger she really is and it s all erroll s fault he starts to go to far with his obsession of finding a missing girl when his job isn t to be a police officer it s a fairly decent movie about a crazy guy who pushes the boundaries and works outside his scope of practice erroll did do a good job but at the sake of the safety of allison it has some good mystery to it too and just when i had it figured out there was more to it
the movie that i am going to review is a little television movie made in and it starred melissa joan hart and daniel baldwin the main protagonist antagonist jennifer stanton hart is a typical all american teenager who is feeling the pressure of having such a controlling father baldwin however when she meets an ex con called nick ryan jeremy jordan never been kissed they instantly fall for each other but jennifer has a different idea on where to take their relationship she manipulates him to kill her parents to protect their love but she just used him to get rid of her parents so she can be with brad david lascher future sabrina cast mate for hart melissa joan hart actually really surprised me with her role as an evil manipulator and she carries the movie well by using her friends and nick so she can literally get away with murder the rest of the supporting cast work well and they each hold their own when they have screen time i also found it interesting that this film was made and released the same year hart began portrayed sabrina the teenage witch and this shows she can act in my genres of film and television although the film has dated somewhat it stills stands out as some of her best work that involves drama or thriller and i am looking forward to nine dead that comes out in november because it shows she can seen as other people that are not called clarissa darling or sabrina spellman i recommend this film to anyone that is a fan of melissa joan hart or sabrina you can watch this on the internet so i suggest check it out
i saw the film at the nashville film festival it was beautifully done from cinematography to the acting it s the story of a father and son and how they come to appreciate each other during a family crisis beautifully written with dialog that never rings false the film showcases the acting talents of paul reiser and peter falk among others in this outstanding cast the film begins with the aging father peter falk is trying to figure out why his wife olympia dukakis has left him the father presents himself unannounced on the doorstep of his son and daughter in law the father and son take off the next day to look at some property and end up taking a classic road trip they fish play pool watch a baseball game get drunk get involved in a barroom brawl and dance with strange women but more important they each confront the unspoken tensions that can affect any family it s the kind of film that touches the heart and makes one appreciate those who are closest to them
i remember liking this more than nausicaa of the valley of the winds at an age when that tone of story was too serious for me laputa whose title seems to have affected its release in the u s to avoid confusion to its wide hispanic audiences has the cartoonish knack of the director s debut production conan in fact pazu has the thick bones and immortal vitality of conan who jumped off a thousand stories carrying his girl in his arms and landed on his feet then started running this makes him the most animated and pleasing character to watch the techie fans of nausica may be disappointed by the flying bugs and the retro technology through out laputa the only exception may be the robot unlike princess mononoke and valley of the winds the theme in laputa is not directly connected to environmentalism if it has a theme at all it s anti warfare the importance of living naturally this is related with the flying castle is dismissably shortly discussed and not really followed through overall i now regard the piece as being at an intersection between feel good and corny
i have always been a huge fan of homicide life on the street so when i heard there was a reunion movie coming up i couldn t wait let me just say i was not disappointed at all it was one of the most powerful hours of television i ve ever seen it was great to see everyone back again but the biggest pleasure of all was to have andre braugher back because the relationship between pembleton and bayliss was always the strongest part of an all together great show
when i first heard about the title i thought of the simpsons just like so many other reviewers but when i saw the cast i was completely stunned that so many great character actors would actually be in this first of all we have christopher walken deer hunter pulp fiction who plays the title character mcbain he is rescued from a vietnam pow camp by some of his buddies one of which is santos chick vennera yanks who splits a hundred dollar bill with mcbain vietnam soldiers are loaded with cash apparently and tells him that he can re do the favor to him if he ever gets into trouble then years later santos and his sister christina maria conchita alonso the running man predator join the rebels in colombia trying to get rid of their evil dictator el presidente victor argo taxi driver king of new york and when santos fails the mission christina goes to mcbain for help mcbain then asks his good ol vietnam buddies to help him first there s the token tough black guy eastland played by american ninja s steve james who was also in director james glickenhaus previous movie the exterminator where the exterminator s real name also was eastland coincidence i think not there is also a lot of other references to the exterminator among other things the most notable one being that mcbain himself wears a welders mask when christina sees him for the first time when he is working on a welding job on top of a bridge the other guys in the vietnam pack are the rich guy who can afford all sorts of equipment for the team frank bruce michael ironside total recall starship troopers and then there s the doc dalton played by jay patterson who doesn t look like the guy the imdb is linking to and i haven t seen him in other movies so who knows and last but not least there s the cop gill who has had enough of his unsatisfying job he s played by thomas g waites who some of us might remember from the warriors and the thing and in other big roles we find luis guzm n boogie nights carlito s way as a small time drug dealer who can t get a decent job also there is dick boccelli as the drug dealing kingpin who gets hung up in a crane on top of a roof by the mcbain gang almost exactly in the same way he got hung up over a meat grinder by john eastland in the exterminator movie now i haven t seen glickenhaus shakedown blue jean cop yet but i m almost ready to bet half a hundred dollar bill that boccelli gets hung up in that movie too well back to the plot of this movie they go off to colombia and saves the day yay but who cares about the plot anyway the cast is great and the action scenes are very well done and you re never bored while watching this movie highly recommended to all action lovers
i saw this film on television and fascinated by the beauty of jennifer mccomb it was a neat film and you can watch it for the beauty of africa and of course mccomb at that time i was thrilled watching this movie and from then onwards i am trying for vcd of this film but i am unable to find it huge african lions makes appearance int his film and we will be spell bounded simply by the size of those animals and grace of them all section of audience can watch this movie particularly children will enjoy this film but some scenes involving mccomb forces parental guidance for this film it is a enjoyable holiday movie for one and all
this is a great little film that s very unique and creative with some great plot twists and wonderful performances all the characters are great and the story while bizarre is fascinating and very interesting plus nicole kidman is simply amazing in this it s very hard to describe this movie because it really is quite bizarre it s a comedy romance one minute then it turns into a thriller the next however it was still very entertaining all the same plus nicole s russian accent was fantastic and extremely convincing chaplin and kidman had very good chemistry together and i loved vincent cassel s performance plus some of the plot twists really took me by surprise the ending was very cute and it s unpredictable throughout plus this movie is quite underrated as well you will feel sorry for chaplin and the way that he is scammed and i thought all the characters were really likable plus the finale is especially good this is nicole s movie though and she carries it with her incredibly sexy performance this is a great little film that s very unique and creative with some great plot twists and wonderful performances i highly recommend this one the direction is very good jez butterworth does a very good job here with great camera work solid angles and keeping the film at a fast pace the acting is wonderful nicole kidman is stunningly gorgeous and is amazing as always she is incredibly sexy very likable had one of the coolest accents added a lot of presence had very good chemistry with ben chaplin and had a very mysterious character she was amazing kidman rules ben chaplin is great here he is extremely likable had a cool character had very good chemistry with kidman the only thing i didn t like was him taking out his anger out on kidman even though what she did was wrong and i loved how he got revenge in the end vincent cassel is fantastic as the main villain yes he was ott but he was very intense and quite creepy at times this role was perfect for him mathieu kassovitz is ok here but didn t have much to do rest of the cast are fine overall i highly recommend this one out of
chris rock stars in this remake of warren beatty s heaven can wait itself a remake of the film here comes mr jordan a comedy about a man who dies before his time before he can realize his dreams and his adventures in his new albeit temporary body in the beatty version the protagonist was a backup quarterback for the then los angeles rams in rock s hipper version our lead character is a struggling young and decidedly low talent standup comedian it s very funny to see the razor sharp rock playing a bad comedian it s kind of like seeing tom hanks play a bad actor lance barton s dream is to play the legendary apollo theater on a non amateur night but every time he tries out his material he s booed off the stage lustily so much so that his nickname becomes booie his jokes are lame his delivery painful in short lance is everything that the real chris rock isn t lance is also a bike messenger and he s riding the streets on his way to try out even more material when bam he s hit by a truck ok so maybe he was taken from his body a tenth of a second early by a slightly incompetent angel eugene levy but hey he was going to get hit anyway no dice it appears lance isn t due in heaven until so what to do mr king chazz palminteri the manager of heaven reluctantly agrees to find a new body for the not quite dead mr barton trouble is the body they find is of a greedy old white man turns out this fella a mr wellington owns all kinds of things he s the th richest man in the country what luck you can imagine how lance will turn things around but of course while in the body of the affluent mr wellington lance falls for a gorgeous hospital worker regina king we males know how tough it is to find a female given our own body but try winning one over while you re an dumpy old white guy and it s even worse when she s not impressed by your money this is rock s first shot at a lead role and in my opinion he performs admirably there s still a lot of the standup comedian in him and of course if he ever wants to get diverse roles he might have to stop incorporating standup routines into the script but this isn t really a bad thing rock s personality his drive his delivery his demeanor and his passion are what fuel this film he s clearly having a lot of fun in the role and he seems bent on making sure you have fun watching him
great screenplay and some of the best actors the world has ever produced montand gives the concept of the lone wolf police detective a whole new dimension of intensity and most importantly credibility when a typical hollywood cop heroe loses family friends and pets to murder he is usually given his minute of grief but when the sixty seconds are over he pulls himself together packs his gun and goes gleefully shooting up his enemies one by one montand s marc ferrot however is really devastated by his girlfriends murder of course but also by finding out that she had another lover in his confusion and wrath he does not seek revenge but needs to keep going to find the real perpetrator of a crime where his fingerprints are all over the scene thus all his actions become unescapably logical this is the main reason why this movie glues us to our seats but definetely not the only one
i recently purchassed the very underrated dreamcast and went off into town to find some games to use them on i bought soul calibur a classic and then i stepped across the domain of resident evil code veronica i have resident evil and have played res evil numerous occasions and i have been impressed with all of them especially no which has to go down in history has a classic but none of them come anywhere near to the dreamcast attempt of brilliant gory gameplay if its just for the sake of buying a dreamcast for this game it is worth every moment of your time and effort ive never been so enthralled over a computer game in the way this has enthralled me anyway the story carrys on from the nd story in which claire redfield searches for her brother chris from the st story who is presumed missing under the conspiracy of the dreaded umbrella corporation little is known about this corporation except the fact that you though you destroyed them times in the previous storys so aiding claire with the assistant of super brat steve u must unlock the truth of the real location of your brother the nd cd enables you to control chris thats if you manage to get that far without running out of the room in fear the control are very slick and the movement of the characters are magnificently realistic when the character notices danger he she faces the direction it is coming from pure genius overall i gave this game because it is simply the game of the year game of the decade and the best game in the world full stop please purchase this game as soon as possible
this film exceeded my expectations i thought and have heard that it was going to be rubbish so i wasn t expecting much however i was pleasantly surprised at first i didn t take well to the lead girl and didn t really care if she lived or died after a while she definitely grew on me and became a likable character it s not just some slasher film where people die for no reason there is a background story that only takes a few seconds of the film but explains a lot i would recommend this film to everyone if you re not sure just watch it anyway it s only an hour and a half of your life you re going to live for years anyway
every time i see nicole i like her more i love a movie like this a woman you just won t give up on but she keeps breaking your heart first movie i remember seeing like this was of human bondage the kim novak laurence harvey version the beefs about the correctness of the russian spoken in this film are petty it was good enough to fool me or anybody else who can t speak russian i m sure funny how people miss the point the no goodnik russian guys were well cast too finally i have to tip my hat to ben chaplin as somebody else noted he plays a sap with great dignity and there was definitely some heat between him and nicole to think guys get paid for that mind blowing
before i see on this film i see a lot of comments which everyone has a great view of the film good or bad what i really want to point out is the acting on woody harrelson behalf he may not be in many parts of the film but when he appears or even the intro i was astonished by will smith s and woody harrelson message they tried to create and maybe slip the entire plot until the end to really understand what is going on i am not a very sentimental person i believe that a good deed should not have remorse or pity behind it but a act to show redemption there is not many films that in my point of view can show this this is one of them that can i agree with one person that commented about this film showing acts of suicide is a downfall however i do not believe that is the message the film is trying to send but sacrifice a bit to the extreme but that is the message in my opinion this film has potential the acting it is worth every penny the script is unbelievable from a person that doesn t really like watching drama films if you like drama this is a must go watch
i m sure that most people already know the story the miserly ebenezer scrooge gets a visit from three spirits the ghosts of christmas past present and yet to come who highlight parts of his life in the hopes of saving his soul and changing his ways dickens classic story in one form or another has stood the test of time to become a beloved holiday favorite while i grew up watching the version starring alastair sims and i believe that he is the definitive scrooge i have been impressed with this version which was released when i was in high school george c scott plays a convincing and mean ebenezer scrooge and the actors playing the ghosts are rather frightening and menacing david warner is a good bob cratchit as well this version is beautifully filmed and uses more modern filming styles for the s which make it more palatable for my children than the black and white version this is a worthy adaptation of the story and is one that i watch almost every year at some point in the christmas season
from the first scene you are given clues as to what may be going on here it becomes more and more obvious as the story rolls on the acting is excellent throughout and these actors touch your soul even though i knew what was going to happen i was extremely puzzled by the motive i m still puzzled as to why ben did what he did we could see in his face second thoughts but the ultimate sacrifice seemed to go against his emotion and feelings it was a very interesting and touching story but it left me confused maybe that was the point of the film i did like the film and wil smith can wrack up another good film choice this guy knows how to entertain an audience
and this is a very disturbing film i may be wrong but this is the last film where i considered burt reynolds an actual actor who transformed the role and delivered a message jon voight and ned beatty are also excellent they are unassuming and unaware businessmen wanting to enjoy the country little did they know what would happen next the photography and sets are realistic and natural this was before the days of wes craven what is most disturbing about this film is the fact that places like this still exist in america country folk still detest city people it is almost a century and a half since the civil war you will enjoy this film it was filmed in the rural sections of south georgia which still exist just don t drive past that to mobile alabama that area still has not been repaired since hurricane katrina
directed by the duo yudai yamaguchi battlefield baseball and jun ichi yamamoto meatball machine is apparently a remake of yamamoto s movie with the same name i doubt i ll ever get a chance to see the original so i ll just stick commenting on this one first of what is meatball machine a simple in noway pretentious low budget industrial splatter flick packed with great make up effects and gore it s not something you ll end up writing books about but it s nevertheless entertaining if you dig this type of cinema meatball machine follows the well known plot boy loves girl but is too afraid to ask her on a date boy finally meets girl girl gets infected by a parasitic alien creature that turns her into a homicidal cyborg boy in turn does also transform into said thing and goes on a quest to save his love will he succeed who gives a damn as long as there is carnage and death i m satisfied the plot is simple relatively clich d but it does it s job well enough setting the movie s course straight forward into a bloody confrontation between the two leading characters there is a subplot focusing on how the parasite that infected the girl came into to their lives and yes it too luckily shows more violence i m happy acting is what you would expect from a no budget splatter film it s not exactly painful for the ears but it s not exactly good either the movie s main attraction besides the violence and gore like i haven t mentioned that enough already are the cyborg designs done by keita amemiya who s work in creating outlandish creatures and costumes for both movies and video games is well known the necroborgs as they are called in meatball machine look stunningly detailed without the usage of cgi amemiya s designs are a breathtaking fusion of flesh and metal painfully awesome in their appearance able to transforms various parts of the body into cool weaponry such as saws rocket launchers blood firing shotguns and so on and so on though you can easily recognize the cheapness of the film necroborgs are a movie class meatball machine is tetsuo the iron man mixed up with alien all done in low budget and extra ketchup mode it s an immensely entertaining film that disregards modern special effects and proves that the splatter genre is still alive and kicking
robert culp they call his character doctor i think he s a vet or something and family move to an affluent low tax zero law enforcement suburb lantern jawed culp and his dog are nearly killed when some local idiot neighbor kids get drunk and go cruising through his front yard at mph he presses charges which arouses the kids ire and suddenly him and his family are the victims of a violent and disturbing prank campaign marilyn manson er marlyn mason rather plays his fretful boiled celery wife who urges him not to use violence against his sneering nemeses and who really just wants to move somewhere with decent public services but the system is getting culp nowhere and he s not about to leave his house because of some punk kids and their crazy rock and roll music and we all know what movie people do when the system fails but this is based on a true story which makes it even better it should be noted that while the villainous hooligans do have convenient s funk o matic teenage theme music that warns us when they re up to no good this film actually ends up treating the age brackets even handedly really it doesn t make a big generational thing out of it kudos for that anyway if you like dogs or at least believe in protecting their civil rights like me and you like justice and you like fire and you like justice for dogs by way of fire and you think people who skitter nervously out of troubled communities are too damn soft then this flick s ethos is up your alley no it s not really good at least not in any widely recognized sense of the word there s nothing subtle or understated or clever about it it s just sort of a feature length psa for vigilantism it does however capture the feeling of some memorable scenes in other beloved works remember in frank miller s the dark knight returns when batman leads the mutants on horseback to reclaim gotham city remember that scene in a christmas story where the kid pounds the bully s face in remember how cool that was or do you just really hate being looked at funny by your neighbors yeah mon unfortunately this was a made for tv movie that i just happened to catch at am on my local wb affiliate and it s probably not destined for dvd release but after being inspired by this film do you think i m gonna just sit here and take it
i loved dan in real life a wonderful journey to love story like you ve got mail or while you were sleeping but not ridiculously full of sight gags and crude jokes and not so romantic it makes you wanna throw up dan burns steven carrell is a popular advice columnist who can t seem to get things in his own life straightened out until one day on a family gathering trip he meets and instantly connects with marie the always beautiful juliette binoche a radiant specimen of a woman who seems to be framed in a hazy filter hearkening back to the starlets of classic cinema chemistry happens over a cup of tea and muffin but marie must be off for a previous engagement and they must part ways later we are treated to dan s tight knit fun loving relatives who not only have big breakfasts together but also enjoy using the intelligent and sweetly dorky dan as the butt of many bachelor jokes what i liked so much was that although the family s characteristics could be seen as obnoxious to some i thought it was a great portrayal of a big family that doesn t venture into parody or crude exaggeration the burns family is simply a close loving group of people who are truly interested in the best for dan there are wonderfully awkward family moments that aren t unrealistic the family is nosey but never mean spirited or gossipy quirky but never outlandish and then dan falls in love with his brother s girlfriend he s brought to the family gathering and thus begins a roller coaster of restrained longing and funny love budding i could go on but i just thought this movie was simply awesome it s not particularly hip or clever never too wordy and obsessed with dry humor or biting wit as many comedies are in modern cinema there is a nice balance of storytelling visuals and funny but real dialogue in fact early in the movie the initial spark of love begins with whimsical discussion in a classic hollywood style conversation where the characters say what they re thinking out loud so i ve probably rambled and repeated myself but i highly recommend dan in real life it s a great date movie trust me you ll laugh and only if you re a geek like me you ll get a bit teary eyed filled with fun and magical love dan in real life won t disappoint out of stars grade a
this movie appears to have designed as a fred astaire ginger rogers film the plot outline dance numbers zippy music and the entire formula is there except for ginger whether it really was originally intended as a re pairing of the team is uncertain but it sure has the look of one of these films instead of the usual sidekicks for fred such as eric blore or edward everett horton burns and allen are used probably since despite being known as a comedy team they could sing and dance quite well this actually shocked me but the team were a welcome addition and some of the traditional fred and ginger numbers were done with either fred and gracie or these two along with george only once at the very end does ms fontaine dance with fred but it s very brief and with a distant camera shot and speaking of burns and allen i think i owe it to the team to talk about them in the film i have never been a fan of their show or their movies in general i find gracie s idiot act very annoying and i have given some poor reviews to their movie shorts and full length films however in this film i must admit that they were great not only dancing competently but i actually thought they were funny and filled the hole left by edward everett horton very nicely they were on top of their game and the writers did a wonderful job in this department now as for the rest of the film it s all a lot of fun and is entertaining the problem for me though was that joan fontaine was not a particularly good choice for the movie not just because she was acting outside her range after all she wasn t a singer or dancer but because she had the screen presence of a ball of lint because of this the usual balance and great boy girl dialog was lacking there was also a very charming performance by harry watson as a devilish little boy who did everything he could do to play cupid all because he wanted to win a bet and finally i loved the fun house and tunnel of love sequence it is too hard to describe but is so much fun to watch overall i did like the film quite a bit it had a lot of charm and excellent writing unfortunately it also featured a bland performance by ms fontaine that knocks off a point bringing my score for this film to
bill paxton of aliens near dark and terminator fame surprises me with his debut as director for frailty he hits on all cylinders but there is one implausibility near the end that involves the fbi agent powers booth which deducts a point from this otherwise chilling and thought provoking thriller other than that this movie was just fine bill paxton plays dad he s never given a first name but that is not a weakness of the film it in fact strengthens the film allowing the viewer to see him as a sort of symbol of some kind he has a vision one day which he says was sent from god telling him that the world is coming to an end and both he and his two sons fenton meiks matt oleary and adam meiks jeremy sumpter must fine the demons and kill them the demons look like normal people which they kill and this makes the viewer wonder if dad has just lost his mind or is he really doing god s work there are scenes that reflect both points which adds to the confusion and gives the film more suspense the story is told in flashback by one of the sons who is now grown up matthew mcconaughey and is speaking with fbi agent wesley doyle powers booth who is very skeptical and rightfully so after all it s not everyday that someone comes in to your office to tell you that he knows who the killer is the film has many twists and bill paxton directs splendidly by keeping us guessing without losing interest the acting is incredible the two young leads and paxton work great together looking like a normal family even though they are all involved in murder like i said there is the one implausibility involving powers booth s character but it really isn t a big thing this was an extremely well made film involving faith and family
let me say first that this show was top tier when john ritter was there upon his death the show did drop off a bit but the producers didn t give up on the show adding james garner and david spade to the regular cast from to the show centers around the hennessy family paul john ritter may he rest in peace his wife cate katey sagal their daughters bridget kaley cuoco kerry amy davidson and their son rory martin spanjers when ritter was on the show i would shriek in laughter and proud to admit it i am but now that he s gone i ll only laugh a little with the occasional hearty laugh i m very glad that i fell for this show s trance after ritter s untimely death because it made the eps with ritter so much better ritter s character is just so well acted and well rounded that you can t help but love him he is always bossing the girls around about dating but he really wants them to be happy it s the ultimate daddy hates boyfriend entertainment katey sagal is great as well and she too is a likable character after ritter s death her character provides such good influence and strength for not only her kids but i believe sagal has shaped the lives of cuoco davidson and spanjers because she and ritter had been friends for a long time the funniest person on the show would have to be bridget hennessy played by kaley cuoco she is the ultimate blonde gorgeous slow dim witted yet she is a smart person she is off the wall hilarious with her innocent blonde humor and how conceited she is amy davidson can get a tad annoying as kerry but that s the purpose of her character the only fault of the show is that the show never really gives kerry anything to be happy about she s always after bridget and her character feels like it s just thrown in there martin spanjers as the lone hennessy son is hysterical and when ritter is on the show he s mostly comic material upon the death of ritter the show does provide some story lines for rory david spade and james garner are all nothing but laughs with the occasional side story for c j spade s character garner plays cate s father as a bit of background information all in all i give this show a great review because it is a great show that had a tragic event happen that crippled it you ll enjoy it spy
what i like about you is one of those series you need to see but aren t sure you would see the beginning is cool and its sucks you into the series just for fun the second part i season which are more stale they come and go in what you want what happens with many series is that they don t end with something special because the second part of the series always goes down into the drain this one also somewhat did the third part is the one to spoil and ruin the whole series usually but it doesn t this ending is perfect for the series it fits perfect actually i was pretty angry about all these guys in val s life actually i wanted to end with jeff in the end but later on it changed they chose to take vic into the series after almost seasons without him and that was the biggest surprise and also what made the series go on top see it many times the series is actually very cool just don t expect the second part to be that good it isn t but the third part does what was needed and made the series to one that was worth the whole thing i am happy to say i was glad and happy about the series and now i will go over to see two guys a girl and a pizza place when i have seen the whole series i will be back
rob estes josie bisset and a crap load of kids that look nothing like either of them basically rob and josie have a shotgun wedding on a drunken night during a vegas vacation they each come home to find that their respective children already know of the nuptials due to tabloid like not so fodder they rob and josie move both of them and their eight kids into one or the other s house rob builds furniture i think which is close enough to frank lambert s patrick duffy construction job on the much similar step by step to warrant eternal mockage josie is some sort of cookie making queen though it doesn t look like she makes any of the cookies not close enough to carol foster s suzanne somers hairdressing job to warrant likeness mockage but hilariously preposterous enough to warrant atrocity mockage unlike step by step they were a couple before the vacation and actually knew one another s last names or so one assumes if their serious enough about a relationship to take a trip together anyhow there are eight kids moira sandy jeff lily daisy nathan andrew l and andrew b i personally think they should ve just called the younger andrew andy there s a lot of product placement particularly for soup at hand which is disgusting and listerine pocket packs there are also some stupid senseless moments it s also not a great film to promote happy families but hey rob estes this concludes my review of step by step on some really bad drugs watch it for rob estes and his pretty eyes there are some great pretty eyes shots
i m sure this is a show no one is that familiar of and might not think good of it after all it is almost close to baywatch hawaii with the cast the location style of the directing and its publicity shows women walking around on the beach and all that no wonder people have misconception and decide not to watch it it was wrong of them to do that cause after i decide to watch the show there are actually more thing going on real juicy story and conflict turn out to be really exciting to watch and pretty much addictive the story of the hotel clerks the manager the owner and their complicated love life also enter the troublesome hotel s visitor and powerful man trying to steal the hotel it actually more exciting than it sounds here i won t deny that the acting suck but it ain t that bad that you ll look away the story is not so consistence but good enough the soundtrack is fitting pretty well with the scenario and the action is all the time i took me couple of episode before there is actually anything happen solidly so be patience recommendation i really do enjoy watching this zillion times better than expected rating grade b please rate my review after reading it thanks
i had seen this film many years ago and it had made a lasting impression on me alas i have hardened to many films over the years and did not expect to be impressed by kalifornia upon watching again recently i am pleased to say that it is every bit as unnerving and watchable as it was ten or so years ago there are two things which really give this movie its power the first is its cast we have a staggeringly disturbing turn by a young brad pitt as early grace knowing pitt as we all do as one of the most enduring heart throbs hollywood has ever had it is refreshing to see him play such a vile unattractive character pitt pulls the show off without resorting to white trash clich or parody and manages to remain genuinely terrifying throughout the movie juliette lewis is equally impressive as grace s tragic girlfriend playing the character like a ten year old girl with a forty year old s life experience lewis manages to evoke pity for her character s station in life as well as contempt for her naivety but she underpins her performance with the kind of subtlety rarely seen by an actor so young personally i think it s a tragedy that neither pitt nor lewis were nominated for any awards for their performances here david duchovony and michelle forbes are both perfectly cast as the yuppy couple who unwittingly end up travelling across the us with pitt and lewis duchovony is aptly geeky and naive and forbes seems emphatically cynical and shut off but both actors manage to convincingly portray their characters changes as they are equally intrigued repulsed and strangely attracted to pitt the fine casting and uniformly brilliant acting aside this film really grabs us by the proverbial balls through its flawless pacing at the time kalifornia was released hollywood was releasing a slew of nice character turns out to be psychotic movies single white female pacific heights the hand that rocks the cradle deceived sleeping with the enemy etc most of these movies followed the same formula the only variation being the nature of the relationship between good guy and bad guy kalifornia doesn t really stray too far from this territory but its first two acts are the perfect example of the slow boil thriller and we are kept on the very edge of our seats waiting for the tide to turn when the penny does drop and pitt is let loose to play the maniacal bad guy the film shifts gears completely and the last twenty minutes don t quite live up to rest of the movie that said the action is thick and fast and the resolution is suitable cold the fight is over but the scars will always be there much of the narration provided by a somewhat whiny pre x files duchovony is a tad contrived of course it s meant to be from the book the duchovony s journalist character has written so one could argue that the self conscious narration is meant to be a nod to the kind of sensationalised style in which most journalists write the film is largely a success and is certainly a cut above of the thrillers of the past twenty years highly recommended but not for the weak of stomach or mind this film is disturbing on more than one level but then it s meant to be
this was one of the all time best episodes officer sean cooper was murdered in his patrol car back in a dying convict in the state penitentiary reveals that he stole a block of heroin from the car after the shooting his case is reopened with the presumption that he was corrupted as a policeman further investigation into him as a police officer and a human being reveals a war veteran involved in a forbidden love this type of love was considered shameful and something to at least keep hidden at that time while this isn t the type of love i personally support he was still a policeman and a human being and shouldn t have been killed for it the sound track was excellent keeps me watching the dvr and the selective use of black and white mixed with color to emphasize one object or give a particular feeling to a scene was especially appealing i shall be watching this one in repeat
attention spoilers first of all let me say that rob roy is one of the best films of the s it was an amazing achievement for all those involved especially the acting of liam neeson jessica lange john hurt brian cox and tim roth michael canton jones painted a wonderful portrait of the honor and dishonor that men can represent in themselves but alas it constantly and unfairly gets compared to braveheart these are two entirely different films probably only similar in the fact that they are both about scots in historical scotland yet this comparison frequently bothers me because it seems to be almost assumed that braveheart is a better film than rob roy i like braveheart a lot but the idea of comparing it to rob roy is a little insulting to me to put quite simply i love braveheart but it is a pale shadow to how much i love rob roy here are my particular reasons rob roy is about real people let s face it the william wallace in braveheart is not a real person he s a legend a martyr a larger than life figurehead because of this depiction he is also a perfect person never doing wrong and basically showing his scot countrymen to the promised land when he finally does fail it is not to his fault like jesus he is betrayed by the very people he trusted most he even goes through the worst kind of torture because he wants freedom so much the depiction of wallace is very well done and effective but it really doesn t inspire or intrigue me i find human ambiguity far more facinating than human perfection that is why the last temptation of christ is a better film than king of kings and that is also one of the reasons why i think rob roy is better than braveheart rob roy may be heroic and brave but he is far from perfect he makes several mistakes that affected the lives of many of his loved ones now sure not bearing false claim against the duke of argyll was an act of nobility and courage but it was also an act of egoism and self centeredness let us not forget that the kinfolk that he had claimed to protect were driven homeless by the end of the film because of this act but rob did the best he could and that was all you could ask of him rob s wife mary is also a normal ambigious person let us start though with how she looks in this film sure she s beautiful but she doesn t wear makeup and she basically allows her natural beauty to show compare this with the two loves or one depending on your point of view of william wallace in braveheart now these two ladies are hot but hardly indicitive of how women looked at the time especially the lay persons maybe not a fair comparison but just another example of how rob roy s attempts for accuracy are far more effective throughout rob roy mary has to live with her vicious rape by the dastardly carrion cunningham she feels compelled to tell rob of her struggle but doesn t because she knows that rob must seek revenge for her rape such revenge would surely mean the death of rob and mary is not prepared for such a sacrifice the villains in rob roy are equally as compelling although the enemies in braveheart are well written they are hardly original robert the bruce a man both brave and cowardly is plagued by moral decisions that are all to familar in the fictional realm should he take his claim as the king of scotland or should he betray wallace in order to ensure the safety of his family name bruce is the most ambigious character in braveheart but from brutus in julius ceasar to fredo in the godfather part ii these types of characters are hardly original longshanks although a compelling villain in his own right is very one dimensional he is the epidemy of evil and his tyrant ways stand in direct contrast to wallace s heroism rob roy has three villains that are wonderful in their chicanery first of all let s start with marquis of montrose he is a man who is so obsessed with his self image that he s willing to let an innocent man suffer because of it see to it that i am not mocked are his favorite words to his factor he is a man obsessed with power upset that a man of great noble bearing as the duke of argyll can be considered of greater providency then him he is shamefully self obsessed and insecure he is an evil aristocrat but in ways that make him unique cunningham and callarn are the conspirators in rob roy and are also roy s direct assailants callarn is so cunning in his cowardace that he is almost comical he will do anything to maintain the good will of the marquis which includes backstabbing and trickery cunningham is a compelling character in that he seems to have been raised to do whatever he can to obtain status and the affection of the marquis he needs a father little does he know that the marquis is his real father therefore when the opportunity to obtain wealth comes from callarn he grabs it without even questioning it he is very much like the evil of modern man so self centered and vain that he cares not about the consequences of his actions on others many have criticized tim roth s performance in this film as overacting hogwash i say it is clear that cunningham is not simply evil but also psychopath throughout the film in a world where a man and his stepson can go around shooting random people for amusement is cunningham too much of an unbelievable character we live in a society where people seem to have decreased the value of human life rob roy simply teaches us that only the circumstances of this decreased value has changed it is a problem throughout human history that the vanity of the human heart will not allow for the capacity for compassion rob roy and mary give us hope that goodness will prevail but snakes will always exist in our world another character that i find fascinating is the duke of argyll he is a true nobleman and his values of honesty and courtesy are in direct contrast to the marquis he appreciates the bravery of rob roy and mary and has a direct vexation for the marquis and his factor he gives the world hope for the people of power hopefully people like the marquis are an exception and not the rule the final duel in rob roy is more exciting then of the battle scenes in braveheart one thing i get tired of is people telling me that braveheart is a better film because of the battle scenes first of all battle scenes are hardly original from spartacus to gladiator hollywood has had a long tradition of historical european battle scenes braveheart has some of the best battle scenes ever put on film but they suffer from one important problem these battle scenes have no context except for the fight for freedom now don t get me wrong duels are hardly original either in fact there are probably times as many films with duels as there are with battle scenes but the context of the duel between cunningham and rob roy is a beauty to behold it is one of the greatest scenes in film history let me explain why first of all the fighting style and the bearing of the two characters in this duel describe the characters perfectly cunningham is effette and dangerous rob roy is strong and courageous cunningham uses a fencing sword while rob uses a broadsword cunningham fights with quick tricky movements while roy s fighting style is more obvious the whole film from the deliberately slow first half to the exciting second half is leading up to this moment it is powerful stuff and it is clear that rob must exterminate this menacing evil that has plagued his whole world when rob finally gets the upper hand literally and figuratively it is one of the greatest moments in film history rob wins because he has more to live for and his honor is more powerful than cunningham s the use of music is absolutely chilling in this scene good prevailing against a real evil is more powerful to me than seeing a dude get disemboweled just so he can yell freedom but hey maybe that s just me rob roy is more realistic than braveheart i don t know that people in the aristocracy or scotsmen talked like the people in rob roy but i do feel that it clearly an attempt to capture their speech patterns i feel that many people are bored by rob roy simply because they can t understand what the characters are saying if this is the case then read some shakesphere or put on the close captioning rob roy is actually one of the greatest written films of the s many of the dialogue in this film is clever but maybe you have to watch the film a couple of times to understand it by contrast the dialogue in braveheart is hardly very interesting of course what do you expect when the main character is a scotsman played by an australian this is a legend and there was clearly not an attempt to capture the speech of the times this film takes place several centuries before rob roy and yet they talk like the people today thus the reason that many people like it better audiences today have become increasingly lazy and they don t want to take the time or patience to understand things that are complex therefore as with many epic films they expect to see the villians speak a recognizable english accent while the heroes speak in a vernacular not too far away from our american language sure it is clear that the wallace is scotish but other than sounding like scotty from star trek and a couple of aye s for acknowledgement the scots in this film fit into the hollywood tradition of how we believe scots should sound so do these descriptions prove that rob roy is a better film than braveheart hardly but if it proves one thing it shows that it is hardly common knowledge that braveheart is a better film than rob roy to put simply rob roy is a film that has themes that are very apropos in today s world braveheart is a film about a legend that is inspiring but hardly realistic you can make a decision on what you think is better grade a score
i don t know why people always want deeper meaning in movies or else consider them worthless what about just being entertained something at which morgan freeman excels he gets a chance to show off a bit paz vega his co star gets a career boost and brad silberling gets a name to draw people into watching his movie i thought it was a good movie some humor some pathos some bittersweetness but nothing over the top i got an especial kick out of jim parsons as the receptionist at a construction company when he looks at freeman adoringly and says you make me want to be a woman he s just hilarious the fight scene between ms vega her ex husband and his girlfriend is wonderful too in short it s a cute charming film that will make you smile you could do much much worse
sadly not available on dvd as yet but worth pursuing on tcm or vhs a secretary believes her boss is wrongly accused of murder and courageously takes on many dangerous characters in an effort to establish the truth a movie with many twists and dark alleyways none of which i will mention the jazz band sequence where our heroine seeks the information about the killer is one of the most erotic scenes in hollywood history despite being at very low budget and made during wwii in black and white despite the low budget long island looks somewhat mountainous this is a movie of original style and outstanding vision ella raines was a great actress discovered by howard hawks who knew much about these matters casting the feistiest women joanne dru hepburn angie dickinson lauren bacall ann sheridan of their era robert siodmak was of one of several german hungarian czech film makers sirk wilder zinnemann lubitsch curtiz lang etc who migr s relocated to hollywood and brought a highly original fresh vision with them sadly ella raines was never given such a great part again and eventually ended up in poorly produced westerns
fred astaire and ginger rogers never made anything but great films together although this is not one of their best it is an excellent musical there are a few outstanding musical numbers good support from randolph scott two notable appearances betty grable and lucille ball make memorable early screen performances ball is particularly good and a blonde as well the let s face the music and dance is one of the musical duo s best numbers ever harriet hilliard better know as harriet nelson of ozzie and harriet plays ginger roger s sister the basic plot is pretty familiar but with a cast this exceptional it works excellent art direction and score
this was one of those wonderful rare moments in t v that i wished i d captured forever on vhs won t it ever air again it was so creative and i remember it was aired once a week and the wait for the next episode was excruciating i want to see it all again i want to buy it i want what i can t have not even on ebay so having ranted enough it was by far one of the best series the s put out it should be considered a classic but is lost in space at least this website and wikipedia mention it sob it was utterly appealing funny flirtatious and original maybe not like sherlock holmes original i actually think quintin is far more attractive and has a better chance with his leading lady than the stiff and chalky holmes ever could
i have lost count of just how many times i have seen this movie i probably know the entire dialog backwards yet i am drawn to it time and again set in hungary a young jimmy stewart plays the eligible bachelor kralik who becomes the secret admirer of margaret sullavan s innocent klara kralik secretly becomes klara s pen friend and at work together klara confides in kralik about the content of his kralik s letters clearly kralik is besotted with klara but is unable to make his feelings known whilst he is in competition with the pen friend confused well you wont be this story has a sweet almost sugary ending but we all know it is the ending we all want other characters worth mentioning are frank morgan playing his usual role this time as the shop s owner hugo matuschek felix bressart as pirovitch kralik s confidant joseph schildkraut as the womanising arrogant vadas so well played that you cannot help but hate him right from the beginning finally william tracy who manages to endear himself to us all with his over confident upstart of a shop junior pepi katona recently re made as you ve got mail starring tom hanks meg ryan for me is not as good as the original although i suspect younger audiences would disagree if this film is on in your area over christmas i suggest you pour yourself a nice glass of wine put a log on the fire and have a box of kleenex handy
this film is really cool every thing looks like it came out of the comic book the sets the costumes and the plot is great clark bartram is again our favorite batman he looked a bit better in dead end but he still pulls it off superman is great too the flying effects are ok but its a fan film so we cant expect them to be the greatest the shot with superman catching the car was very believable it was cool this is a movie i would definitely see if it were real its got every thing you would want in a batman superman movie one exception though i would cast the joker instead of face overall i give this film a because its a great film
stairway to heaven is a outstanding invention of movie making probably never duplicated i rank it with the wizard of oz and african queen although it is a totally different type of movie than african queen stairway to heaven is a psycho drama that uses performance concepts and technical effects that to my knowledge are totally unique for example there is the combination of b w and color footage as in oz but the significance of the contrast goes way beyond the simple but beautiful effect achieved in oz in stairway the purpose and effect of the contrast can only be described as powerful another brilliant aspect of stairway is the concept of time and how it is used here how could anybody have conceived of a better way to make time stand still literally and then there is the stairway itself if you have any imagination at all you will agree with me stairway to heaven is a true gem
i found this movie really funny because you have a youthful black comedian chris rock who dies and is sent back to earth in a mid s white mans body he doesn t realize that his behavior should change and continues to act as he had before he listens to rap music sings along and plays the stereotypical part of an urban black man the real humor in this movie was watching the trouble that this behavior gets him into with the black community
this has to be hands down hats off one of the most uproarious comedies ever made starting with the animated blowing popping bubbles the entrance to the daytime awards the usual phony drivel spewed by the stars on the red carpet the rehearsed and badly acted acceptance speech the venomous comments uttered by the actor s jealous co stars and producer under phony smiles now that is only in the first few minutes then all hell breaks loose from there and it only gets more frantic and ridiculous ridiculous in a good way no make that a great way this was the first time i d seen the always charming teri hatcher while i may not be a follower of desperate housewives she herself is always watchable same goes for lois clark not a huge follower but if i run across an episode i d watch it robert downey jr does a great turn as slimy smarmy snaky sycophantic david seaton barnes the producer who d give his right eye to see sally field s celeste talbert leave the show if only to finally get to get it on with cathy moriarty s montana moorehead moriarty absolutely shines in this movie just as she had everywhere else she s appeared here all she has to do is scream i hate you i hate you you creep or give one of her anti celeste co conspirators an evil grin and she has me rolling in the aisles yes cathy moriarty is a very gifted actress and one hell of a comedienne sally field gratefully departs from the usual mm sized lifetime tragedy of the week movies and we re all reminded why she is who she is today having started off in comedy afraid of nothing her ensuing years of drama had hidden her sense of humor but like a caterpillar in a cocoon the brilliant comedienne she is had blossomed and it was joyous to see her as hilarious as she was the thing with dramatic actors and actresses is that you see in such heavy serious roles that you associate them with their character and you can t believe it when you see them finally having some fun on screen how lucky were the producers to land carrie fisher if only for a glorified cameo she doesn t realize what a presence she bears on screen she takes a role which in the hands of a lesser actress could easily have been forgotten but she owns the character and it seems as if she wrote it herself how lucky was elisabeth shue to get thrown in the middle of all this at the time she wasn t really known for much adventures in babysitting was kind of cute yes i was dragged to an evening show for which i had to pay full price but she didn t hold my attention much but here she makes the most of her character star s niece who falls in love with the star s ex co star and lover who of course turns out to be the niece s father and the star turns out to be the poor girl s mother i ll stop there i feel i practically wrote a book about this brilliant screwball comedy or at least a novela if you ve seen it then reminisce if you haven t you ve missed a real classic but not really the dvd s are made of a material that ll last for at least years and this movie is timeless so what the hell
here s another movie that should be loaded into a satellite fired into space and pointed in the direction of the galaxy andromeda to show distant possible civilizations the best of humanity this movie is so endearingly stupid and revealingly honest in being little more than a rip off of the already bad movie classic king kong from that it not only manages to upstage that film in terms of sheer belly laugh idiotic goofiness but successfully predicted much of peter jackson s miserable computer cartoon bearing the same name as far as a romance between the giant here a yeti and a gorgeous human female antonellina interlenghi of umberto lenzi s city of the living dead who is very easy on the eyes the film was made for kids so aside from some innuendo over fish bones and a bizarre nipple tweak to say goodbye you can forget about sex the yeti even has a sort of giant jock strap to cover up his monstrous package the result being even more amusing than anatomical correctness but as a trade off you do get a wacky old scientist two inquisitive kids tony kendall in a rare turn as a duplicitous bastard of a villain a helpful intelligent collie dog who gets to have her own adventure dog adventure movies were big in europe for a while and of course emerges as the hero at the end for saving the yeti who turns out to be the good guy glorious stuff like front end loaders decorated to look like giant ape hands a monster who s size literally changes scale from shot to shot some inappropriately horrible deaths that will make the carnage in godzilla vs the smog monster look tame by comparison crowd reaction shots a plenty made up of either spanish italian or canadian extras depending upon scene you can sort of tell where they were shooting from how the extras are dressed and some of the most enthusiastically staged but inept special effects work ever in a giant monkey movie it s here that the film won me over it s enthusiasm just for being made frank kramer is actually the same gianfranco parolini who brought the world sartana in and god s gun the year before this was a very important director in the spaghetti western and action adventure genre film scene from the s s and by the time of yeti he was probably delighted to get the work i would say that this is his most adventuresome movie ever or rather the one he took the most chances with and may have felt more comfortable taking those chances with the film aimed at kids families the movie has a kind of reckless abandon to the way it was made that renders the technical errors or inconsistencies totally meaningless or rather they are part of the fun and if the movie had been played seriously it wouldn t have worked which is exactly why peter jackson s movie sucked he forgot to have fun with the material and let it dictate the outcome using his army of stupid power macintosh pod people animators and with all it s faults clunkiness kramer s yeti is actually closer to the spirit of why we watch movies like this which is partly to see actors in ape suits tearing apart miniature sets on sound stages not seamlessly animated vapid hours of nothing other than hard drive space i d rank this up there with king kong versus godzilla and it curse of the great golem as one of the most enjoyably improbable giant rampaging monster movies ever because the movie looks so fake you can get over the story and just have fun watching stuff get wrecked trampled tossed about and smashed knowing that and armed with a fertile energetic enthusiasm for having the chance to make the movie parolini pulled out all the stops and delivers a full bodied adventure that might get a bit rough for some of the small tykes but is the first movie i will ever share with the grandkids someday when their stupid parents leave them with me for a weekend this is stuff for the ages and one of the most telling expressions of humanity to ever be committed to celluloid it s about ten minutes too long but who cares you only come around once and i d rather go out with a smile on my face
as others have commented i checked this out after siskel and ebert listed this as one of their top movies of the year what a gift i then went out to buy it just so that i could loan it out best quote dwight yoakum stops his truck when he realizes that someone cage is on top of his cab when cage peers down he apologizes i m sorry if i scared you yoakum thrusts his pistol in cage s face with does this look like i m scared great bit of humor after an exciting and temporary escape there really was a sense of fun to this the constant sighting of the welcome to red rock sign elicits a groan and a smiling head shake the music created a hunting eerie quality to the film reminiscent of twin peaks unlike twin peaks though it doesn t spoil things by going too far into the outlandish needing to top itself i admit watching the credits times you see they had yoakum s thousand miles from nowhere perfectly chosen playing as a freight train curved around down to the desert floor with snow capped mountains in the distance this was incredible fluid framing further i ve never seen a better unification of sight and sound on film also it totally fit the story
one of the first of the best musicals anchors aweigh features several memorable musical sequences such as kelly dancing with jerry the mouse kelly dancing with year old sharon mcmanus sinatra singing with jose iturbi playing piano kathryn grayson singing with iturbi conducting and much more the technicolor is perfect with some innovative camera work such as seeing a piano played from beneath through transparent keys and grayson singing seen through the finder of another camera the plot is thin but you get involved from kelly s sinatra s enthusiasm sailor s on leave they have to take home a runaway boy dean stockwell and sinatra falls for his aunt to set him up with the aunt grayson kelly suggests that sinatra can get her an audition with jose iturbi but sinatra s young and naive in this one and in his own sung words falls in love too fast while they re trying to contact iturbi who s never available he starts to fall for another girl barbara britton but kelly s now falling love with grayson anchors aweigh is most often remembered for the combination live action cartoon sequence with tom and jerry but there s a lot more here that s worth a look i m giving it nine stars because while it s not quite as good as the best musicals singin in the rain the music man oklahoma it is one of the first of their class of technicolor big productions perhaps meet me in st louis was the first and better than most others
having looked at some of the other comments here i have a main complaint with this presentation the two primary characters are attractive in their own ways the beautiful victim and the handsome obviously extremely off center blue collar protagonist if just short of totally deranged take turns beating the hell out of each other sort of like a caucasian kabuki scenario this is all right and this is of course mainly a turning the tables story however my referenced complaint is that i believe the director got caught up in his desire to display farrah s well known and obvious physical attributes beginning with her being enticingly clad in a thin robe and with a number of scenes displaying more than needed for any dramatic effect while immensely pleasing to the eyes these distract from the poignancy level of the drama her roommates i m certain give performances as written and directed however their respective skepticism and histrionic babbling and sobbing don t ring true based upon farrah s previous experience with this guy the obvious evidence of his having come to their premises with only the worst of intentions and that she would have absolutely no grounds to be exaggerating what has occurred but this is a film and story compelling as much in spite of as because of the director s work
the shooter was a different type of film for michael dudikoff although normally associated with action flicks that incorporate martial arts this film because it was a western enabled him to display that he is a far more capable actor than certain formula story lines have allowed the major problem of course is that the film does not allow any solid character development the fleshing in is really left to the viewer we can only guess at the sadness that has made the shooter whose real name is michael atherton the killer that he is a killer mind you that a little town terrorized by a local bully welcomes as a hero who can release it from its misery
it s rare that i sit down in front of the tv specifically to watch a particular programme it s even rarer when i actually enjoy the programme in the end but last of the blonde bombshells was one of the best movies i think i ve seen a remarkable cast led by dame judi dench and ian holm and an excellent witty and poignant script combined to make it a truly rewarding experience i can t really express how good i thought it was so i won t try i ll just say if you get the opportunity please see it i only hope it comes out on video
documenting a documenter that s one way to describe keep the river on your right a modern cannibal tale this film follows anthropologist tobias schneebaum who in his late s went on a journey back to the places he spent time as a participant field researcher over years ago first to west papua and then peru tobias is a full bodied character a gay jewish artist anthropologist who eeks out a living on a cruise ship teaching gawking tourists about the cultures he has come to have a deep respect and understanding for author of several books documenting his time with both the asmat people of west papua and the cannibalistic amazonians in peru tobias has been haunted by what happened in his time in these places and how intimate his connection and relationships had become yet tobias constant wonder and appreciation for the places he got to know is admirable and a real pleasure to watch one can only hope to ever achieve and retain such humility themselves tobias makes a compelling subject for study as the experiences he faced in immersing himself in these two tribal societies has left him fundamentally changed this film challenges the notions of morality and naturalness e g nudity homosexuality cannibalism watch for the graphic circumcision scene when questioned as to why he engaged in some of the local practices that others would morally denounce his non judgmental nature asks why not who is to say the way of other cultures is right or wrong this little sleeper is a must watch for not only national geographic types but also those interested in the art of documentary making this film shows what can be done shot on video the editing provides a quiet revelation of tobias life that leaves you watching in fascination at times he despairs at being pushed by the film crew to make the emotional journey back especially considering his age and physical frailty we can be but grateful that tobias allowed the tables to be turned on himself perhaps sympathising with the desire to understand humanity and one s place in the world the filmmakers provide some moments of critical balance presenting for example one anthropologist who believes that tobias predetermined his findings of homosexuality in this case based on his personal interests that said you can t decide when to stop being shocked and when to take this man home for a cuddle move over river queen this is the best river ride i ve taken in a while
i rented this movie this past weekend cranked up the surround sound system and got some great sound from special affects this movie is a great movie rental the special affects where enough to scare my fiance but i noticed some looked suprisingly computer generated i didn t go to the movies and see this but its a scary late night don t feel like going out movie i would recommend it
whilst reading through the comments left for this show i couldn t help but notice that a large percentage of the reviewers had either not actually watched any episodes of the show either all the way through or of their own free will the thing about kerching is that it s a children s show for children so obviously if your older it is going to seem cheesy forced and probably stupid i even found one person saying the sets were stupid but i remember as an eight year old wondering why taj had ikea icecube moulds on his wall and also wondering if my parents would let me stick some on mine they didn t yeah it can be annoying the acting could be better and some of the characters do really weird things with their hair but as a kids show i rate it compared to the stuff they air in its place today well lets just say i wish it d be re aired dvd release anyone
i had heard some not too good things about this movie and had probably seen the low score here at imdb and that s why i had avoided it today they showed vanilla sky on tv and as i had nothing better to do and as it turned out i would have had a hard time finding anything better to do vanilla sky is a frightening sad and touching movie actually one of the best i ve seen in a while i was surprised by how i was affected watching it it s hard to explain but during the movie your feelings towards the characters and your perception of what is going on changes and it s quite an emotional journey vanilla sky really touched me in a way that is very rare for a movie or any media for that matter i really recommend everyone to watch this movie regardless of what you have heard about it
before sunrise is romance for the slacker generation richard linklater s romantic drama is an offbeat telling of a dream come true for most people the film depicts romance in all it s glory but without any of the pitfalls that befall most couples and in short the film is about two people that have a relationship that s as close to perfection as relationships will ever come to with just one problem the problem of time while most relationships wind down with time this one keeps going strong throughout and time itself is the only thing that wears out before sunrise is certainly not the typical sentimental hollywood romance which is another aspect that puts this film leagues ahead of the pretenders the story follows two people jesse an american and celine a french girl that meet on a train into vienna they instantly connect and after telling her his awful idea for a television show and almost getting off the train jesse asks celine to join him for the day in the picturesque city of vienna before sunrise works principally for two reasons realistic acting and an immense script that builds the characters through their thoughts and feelings and thus allows us to get to know them as we do the people in real life this allows the characters to be free and it s easy to believe that these are real people and not just actors working from a script this also allows us to feel for the characters for who they are and not merely because they re the protagonists this kind of realism is hard to capture as at the end of the day we as the audience know that they re watching a film and not observing real life but before sunrise represents one of the truest to life exhibitions of realism ever to be seen on screen a truly great script cannot work on it s own and needs great actors to deliver it to an extent that does it justice and although i m not a fan of either julie deply or ethan hawke on viewing this film there is nothing you can do but give them both respect i don t know whether they were in character or just playing themselves but when a film is this good it hardly matters in a film like this it is the writing that s the most important thing and contained within the script are several observations about life most of which i personally could relate to this represents what richard linklater has achieved with this script as not only does it create and build the characters but it also manages to expose what true love is along with several other aspects of life the fact that not all the anecdotes are relatable to me personally again represents the brilliance of writing everyone is different and so different parts of the script will appeal to different people there could be certain aspects about one person that one person loves and another hates and that s the case with the musings in this script adding to the beauty of the film is the city of vienna the city itself isn t really important to the film as this is a story that could have taken place just about anywhere but it makes for some lovely visuals and the upbeat energetic romance that blossoms throughout the movie is matched by the beauty of the location before sunrise is simultaneously beautiful and captivating richard linklater has created something that is rare in the world of cinema a film that captures the beauty of life without ever going over the top or being overly sentimental before sunrise is what it is and what it is is pure cinematic brilliance
this is my favorite movie ever i have watched it at least times and i cry every time my family begs me not to watch it so i wont have a crying fit i think i love that it is a true story written by antwone himself just as much as i love the movie the acting is top notch and the actors were perfect for their role denzel washington is one of my favorite actors but this is my favorite movie he has done so far i took care of a little boy who was also born in jail he was the most precious little boy i had ever met he has now been adopted by a wonderful family who fought for him for almost two years i saw this movie while the fight was still going on and his future was unsure and i am so happy he is safe and loved and i am so happy antwone s happy and found his family i would love to know more about him and how it has been since meeting his family i just cant say enough good things about it
as someone who has never condescended adam sandler in terms of talent as is done to him and many comic actors like him i walked in to reign over me expecting a great film not simply because of his presence in the movie but because i thought that it looked very good overall even someone who already thought that sandler could deliver an effective dramatic performance is writing here that i was surprised at how fantastic he is in it he will make you weep especially in his purposefully sudden and unexpected monologue what s amazing about his role is that it s a character it s hard to say we ve seen before we ve seen many emotionally scarred characters many mentally retarded people many loners many passionate self centered artists but sandler s charlie fineman is none of these he may have a taste of each of them in some ways but his character is truly unpredictable and completely individual it s a joy for the audience to be drawn in emotionally by him and be tugged every which way by someone whose problems mindset and provocations are completely different from most characters like him don cheadle delivers an interesting performance on a completely different level he is every man he is the most normal possible person in the world so much so that you will hardly find many characters like his either or at least any that are played the way he plays alan johnson whose name is even found on the assembly line cheadle is brilliant in that he is funny jolting smart and stupid the way so many normal people are the rest of the cast is populated by actors and actresses who ve hardly done anything in awhile in smaller but quite colorful roles jada pinkett smith is the overly refined upper middle class wife donald sutherland is the impatient but surprising judge robert klein is sandler s desensitized father in law mike binder s script is quite brilliant because it says something quite profound about the wonders of communication in all of its guises it s much more subtle than say babel and has a much more close to home ideal the camera is only interested in the reality of its images as opposed to the mere style this film struck me as sort of a sendback to the kitchen sink style of the s cinematography was grainy and unfastened but that was its charm it wasn t about attracting us to the camera itself and the gloss that would ve diluted its stories with such the music which plays a major role in the film and its title is very powerful near the beginning you feel like you re in for another about schmidt or little miss sunshine sort of soundtrack but you soon realize you re in for more than that in fact the film is packed with lots of music that stimulates a lot of the most emotional scenes reign over me is a major statement not only for society but also for film itself it goes to show that even the director of blankman is capable of wonders
i haven t laughed that much in a long time although the movie has some sad moments too especially when it changes from hyper funny to honest and serious the characters are very realistic most of the times sappy sometimes but quite believable i am not a fan of the jerry springer show i feel sorry for the participating people this film instead is a satire and it is doing great too bad that all expletives were beeped out while this movie aired on public tv that takes a lot of fun out of it i will go rent this movie to fully enjoy it
i knew i was going to see this when i saw the first preview dennis quaid was one reason but the theme of holding on to your dreams speaks to me people talk about this as a movie for kids but i think it s a movie for baby boomers who are coming to terms with aging infirm parents our own mortality our kids growing up and leaving us and all the other things we never thought would happen to us the movie doesn t fall into the trap of tragedy it s about what living your dreams means when you have a real life quaid is too small for a pitcher but he makes it look good and rachel griffiths makes a small part as the wife into a thoughtful layered performance the camera work is slow and sweet when they put this movie together they left out anything that wasn t necessary very nice
ghost story the new house is a terrific horror story this is from the circle of fear and the ghost story series of the early seventies the beginning and ending of each story is narrated by sebastian cabot remember him from the early family series family affair in the s this particular story has barbara parkins and david birney as the lead actors and as the main characters in the story i saw this recently and i was so scared if you are alone i would not recommend that you watch this this story is terrific no gore or curse words but very scary barbara parkins played the young bride david birney played her husband both actors were very good in their parts if you like scary fun terrifying ghost stories then you will like this little gem i gave this a high rating i highly recommend this story
tintin was one of my favorite heroes as a kid i used to borrow the books from the school library every chance i got my favorite one was the red sea sharks so much action and humor this documentary was a brilliant exposition of the background story of herge and his development of tintin the film maker s personal experience in interviewing herge and the story of his relationship with the artist who was the inspiration for the chan character was very moving a great documentary of a very talented and well loved artist a great example of someone who has become internationally renown and has brought joy of millions of children and the young at heart all over the world
halloween is the story of a boy who was misunderstood as a child he takes out his problems on his older sister whom he murders at the beginning of the film this is just the start of things to come from michael myers donald pleasance plays the doctor who s been studying myers for years he knows that something is different about him something mysteriously evil this evil will not be contained and it cannot be stopped after an escape from an institution myers tracks down his younger sister if he kills her there may be an end to the troubles of this misunderstood boy but he seems to have problems in finishing his sister off as other people get in the way he manages to take them out while still looking for that one girl he needs there have been a lot of those horror movies involving teenagers getting hacked to pieces by a masked or gruesome killer but this one started it all sort of if you think about it most of those horror movies we all remember are the ones that have freddy kruger or jason chasing around half naked girls well if it wasn t for halloween those characters wouldn t have haunted our dreams when we were children halloween s director john carpenter got a lot out of the horror movies of the s and combined everything he knew into one film that scared the hell out of a lot of people back in the late s this films solidified him as a director to watch and also jump started the career of jamie lee curtis who plays the girl being stalked by the masked killer this film may seem clich today but back then there wasn t much out there like this it s been copied from and ripped off of but halloween will always remain the quintessential teenage horror movie it still gives you chills listening to carpenter s thrilling music while we see another victim get chased by that shadowy michael myers
i m disappointed that reiser who wrote the film felt the need to use so much profanity for no reason whatsoever maybe that s his idea of adult films plenty of nasty words with bathroom humor thrown in i thought better of him and think less of him for this movie falk s acting and some moments of humor as well as some possibly important themes are what made me give it such a high rating this might be a good movie for adult children to watch and laugh over about their own folks and their foibles but the lack of consideration for audience families seriously detriments what could have been a family film but fails certainly not worth spending money on though it might be worth a watch for free on television
does anyone know what kind of pickup john t drove i looks like a mid to late s ford this movie is my favorite as well as my wife s it was the first memorable movie we saw as a married couple the pick up is of interest as it is similar to the first truck i drove and recently found another like it i would like to restore the pick up i have to resemble the on in the movie also the music was awesome and the acting was great where and what is the lady who portrayed john s aunt also did john have a stunt double for the scene on the tower when he almost fell also what year of mustang did debra w drive in this show it looked like a s model thanks
a really sweet movie that has some similarities to the hit my sassy girl but is able to enchant most of the time the biggest applause should go to the two leads ha neul kim is both sweet and quirky sang woo kwon is both attractive and rebellious the chemistry between the two is very good director kyeong hyeong kim uses some cg inserts to pepper up the visuals and also offers impressive fight scenes in which sang woo kwon can shine i liked him a lot better here than in the highly overrated volcano high and that boy has a future those looks those fight techniques and a romantic lead not bad well i can make it short nice film my rating
the color purple is a masterpiece it displays the amazing acting abilities of whoopi goldberg oprah winfrey and danny glover not only is steven spielberg the most incredible director of all time but his versatility shines through in this film if you ever want to see what a movie can do watch this it s a beautiful portrayal of one of the most moving stories of all time
while i am not a big fan of musicals i have loved the films of fred astaire and ginger rogers because they are just so much fun sure they can be a bit formulaic but even though you know what is going to happen they still are very pleasing to watch however despite this i was a bit disappointed in this outing part of it was because this film doesn t have the wonderful supporting cast like you saw in top hat or shall we dance without edward everett horton or eric blore the film seems to be a bit lacking especially in the fun department the silly antics of these supporting actors gave the other films charm that you just don t get with follow the fleet in addition unlike the usual character played by astaire this one is more of a jerk as his fat head gets rogers into trouble again and again and as a result it s a lot harder to like him or want to see them get together in the end of the film plus although the music is by irving berlin the songs just don t seem as memorable in fact none of the songs were all that special and i can t recall any of them even though i just saw the movie while this is still a cute and worthwhile film it just lacks the sparkle and magic of some of their other films good but far from great
this german documentary in english is about a scottish environmental sculptor named andy goldsworthy he makes art from objects he finds in nature for example early in the film we see him taking sections of icicles and gluing them together with a little moisture into a serpentine shape that seems to repeatedly go through a vertical rock of course the icicles melt but that transience is a part of most of goldsworthy s work he goes to a site and gets a feeling for it deciding intuitively what to make that day he talks of having a dialog with the rocks and other materials that he works with attempting to work with rather than against them it might be stones or flowers or leaves or sticks the sculpture might last for minutes or years or might not even last long enough to be completed and photographed the work seems to be more of a process than a goal the film and the work is beautiful inspiring and thought provoking it moves pretty slowly which is appropriate for the material but you should be sure to go when you have had a good night s sleep but do go if you have the opportunity search the web for some other pages about andy goldsworthy or to read about his local sculpture at stanford university there are also several books available with photographs of his sculptures my thoughts skip reading this part if you want to find what this film means to you completely independently i recall a couple of ideas that occurred to me while watching the film which i thought i would share for those of you still reading first the transitory nature of much of andy goldsworthy s work reminded me of the natural ebb and flow of human life we re born we live and eventually we die that s natural and that s also naturally a part of goldsworthy s art the other thought was to be awestruck with the way that goldsworthy has managed to integrate his passion and his work so thoroughly into his life most of us have work which is tolerated at best a life which we hardly notice living and passions which we really mean to spend more time on if we even remember what they are andy goldsworthy has managed to create an amalgam of all of these aspects of his life that looks like it works very well and is nourishing for him and those around him wow seen on
different film directors from different countries have contributed to the film medium a lot by their thoughts as a result we have experienced different genres when the medium is concerned jafar panahi unlike j l godard or f truffault believes in simple story telling schematic narratives is one of the main traits of his directorial job he has trust upon the automatic as well as critical intelligence of the viewer he does not feel any necessity to go for alienation or such things to reach to the viewers he is equally effective despite being conventional offside is another schematic creation from him where gender subordination of middle east asia gets gradually clear to everybody as the simple but catchy tale of the movie progresses now a days when all of us are shouting on the issue of rights of women this movie very calmly creeps into our mind and ultimately becomes a hump for our critical intelligence by conveying the message that the egality of human rights is nothing but an illusive good an utopia paternity will never let the women to be empowered an important soccer match where the nation is participating a teenage girl who understands the game well loves her nation does not have the rights to enter into the stadium to cheer for her country she is merely permitted to listen to the live commentary her alias could not work for her as a result she had to undergo several humiliating situations from the very beginning her worried father ran here and there for her daughter at the end of the day celebration came as the nation won the match which the girl could not see as she was detained in the outer side of the stadium during the match time but the celebration cannot suppress the question of rights of women which remain in every corner of the world in different format jafar panahi has most successfully pointed to this issue of gender abuse from with in the frame of conventional film making and patriarchy as well a global tragedy has been dealt with ease and some times with humour which in turn teases our being constantly
dumland focuses on the lives of one american family the father a violent and obscene person who loves to fart and use profanity and who has no redeeming qualities the mother who appears to be a paranoid psychotic never really says much the son an obscure annoying repetitive little fellow the animation is simple and crude but does suite the stories and the characters the episodes were originally only available from the davidlynch com website but have now been released on dvd there are episodes on the dvd and a brief synopsis follows the neighbor we meet the next door neighbor and find out three things about him he has a really nice shed he only has one arm and he likes to do naughty things with ducks the treadmill we find out that the wife has an affinity for exercise but the husband doesn t really think it s a good idea in the end the exercise treadmill is victorious the doctor the father has an unfortunate accident with an exposed live wire the doctor s examination is quite thorough if not unconventional but the diagnosis is you are perfectly normal but we knew that a friend visits after an altercation with the new clothes hoist a friend comes to visit believe it or not he has one but after we meet him we can understand why no surprises when he tells us what his hobbies are get the stick we meet another neighbor he has a stick stuck in his mouth although we never find out how it got there unfortunately removing the stick from his neighbor s mouth ends up being harder and more violent than expected but he is victorious in the end jesus some people can be ungrateful my teeth are bleeding this was my favorite episode and was also the most mind numbingly repetitive and annoying hmm what does that say about me not sure why the son s teeth started bleeding but believe me when i say it was minimal to the plot of the story which is an oxymoron as the story had no plot but did have a funny ending involving a fly uncle bob after meeting uncle bob and uncle bob s wife we get a distinct feeling that the dumbland gene pool is very shallow uncle bob is a sickly fellow i shan t elaborate lest i spoil it for you uncle bob s wife definitely wears the pants in his family and the father definitely ends up on the wrong side of her ample fist and spends the rest of their visit cowering in a tree in the back yard ants after the home gets infiltrated with ants and a misbegotten attempt to bug spray them goes awry he ends up spraying himself in the face with the bug spray and starts hallucinating the ants put on a fabulous song and dance show he goes berserk trying to kill them winds up in a full body plaster and lets just say the ants get their vengeance in the end as bad as these stories are there is something that kept compelling me to watch them they do give another insight into the mind of one of my favorite directors david lynch maybe they were an outlet for him to get rid of some of his violent thoughts i did actually laugh out loud at many points within the episodes many aspects are absurdly funny
the first film had little ambition so nothing sticks to the screen it was a bad version of back to the future with zero charm once accepted that bill ted are nitwits the joke can only get hammered at the audience for so long before it breaks this is a surprise this is your only spoiler warning by today s standards this is more fun this was shunned upon release sad considering that more talent is involved than the first time we get the photographer of face off the editor of fugitive a production designer from burton s early work and the sound designer of matrix the writers made up for their shallow first outing with something deep since this was shunned by the fanbase and public the director probably decided the style was too extreme it s not it fits the material like death becomes her and catch this dares to be smart but we like our movies simple so we don t buy it probably since this dared to be different is why it took producers to pull it off what s so good nice self reference towards keanu from airhead to messiah see also arnold schwarzenegger joss hates his creations as much as he hates their counterparts he makes his own hatred the evil b t and the good robot usses have the same vocabulary as their originals lesser copies and depreciation of language the duality motif nowhere else is this evident than in the photography styles lots of high and low angles they even use roy brocksmith from total recall to emphasize the point the choices motif i don t know where this started in the genre maybe ghostbusters but it s used pretty well here it even boils down to the games against death battleship and club film self reference even present in the game against death clue this is smarter than tarantino or brooks notice the premier magazine cover at the end bill and ted the movie ironic also how death and nomolos were villains in the die hard and lethal weapon sequels i still have some minor nits but nothing compared to the original music and film are different mediums so it makes no sense why many scripts revolve around the former particularly in the teen market carlin is a great comedian but in these movies he s wasted also for all the daring this effort shows even cracking gay jokes they can t kill a cat so despite looking like a nickelodeon production this is incredibly interesting from this movie we got beavis and butt head we re in heaven and we just mugged three people final analysis midrange material
walt disney s the rookie is based on the story of jim morris a former minor league picher who made one of the most amazing comebacks in sports history ending an almost year retirement and making his major league debut in at the age of the film opens with a brief synopsis of morris childhood which included a series of re locations his father was a military man and even when his family settled for good in football crazed texas morris passion for baseball remained strong the childhood segment then jumps ahead about years to the adult morris played by dennis quaid who is now a baseball coach and chemistry teacher at big lake high school in real life it was reagan county high school in big lake texas it is mentioned that he attempted a career as a baseball player but that it didn t work out morris s team is struggling and he lectures them about giving up on their dreams they turn the table on him telling him that he should try out for a major league team at several times when he pitches to them in practice they express amazement at the speed with which he throws morris seems unconvinced but agrees to a deal with his players in which if they win district he will try out for a major league team big lake does win district and adhering to his end of the deal morris attends a tampa bay devil rays try out phenomenally he throws miles an hour faster than he threw during his minor league career and an outstanding speed even for a major league pitcher after another try out with the team morris is offered a contract with the devil rays this leaves him with a tough decision stay in his comfortable life or once again pursue his major league dream by going through the minor league grind of making little money and spending months at a time away from home and the decision is even more agonizing than during his first minor league stint because he now has a wife and three children morris signs with the devil rays begins at the aa level and moves up quickly to the aaa level one level below major league baseball but as the season winds down the chances of him getting called up grow increasingly slim for the most part i love this movie there are lots of great performances and likable characters and it s easy to find yourself really pulling for morris also the movie does a great job portraying professional baseball at both the major and minor league levels and most of all it teaches the timeless message of holding tight to your dreams even when they seem distant and almost impossible to achieve still the movie has some flaws while generally accurate it exaggerates and even fabricates a few things check out http espn go com page s closer html for some examples also except for one scene in which he prays with his players the movie completely ignores morris christian faith but considering disney s left wing zeal that s not surprising presumably a lot of the exaggerations fabrications were done to make the story more dramatic yet the minute documentary on morris that is included on the dvd features some information that makes his story more dramatic but is excluded from the movie for example from birth until his family settled in texas for good when he was morris re located times and his initial minor league career ended after four surgeries through which he lost half of the muscle in his left pitching shoulder thus making his throwing mph even more inexplicable to fully appreciate and understand the story of jim morris it s good to not only watch the rookie but to watch the dvd s documentary check out the aforementioned link to the movie s inaccuracies and probably also to read morris biography also titled the rookie i haven t read the book but i hope to one of these days but overall the rookie is a very good portrayal of a miraculous story and is a powerful testament to the power of dreams and the triumph of the common man
so mary and rhoda have aged who hasn t i was a teen when mary premiered and a young adult when it left the air yes it was great to see mary and rho together and yes maybe the film didn t sustain the comedy of the original series but there were enough moments that recalled the spirit of the series to make this a fitting tribute example the producer who hires mary and then dictates the idea for a new series about old people isn t this typical of the mentality of present day hollywood tv and film bean counters this may not be the mary tyler moore show at its best but it s a pretty damned good look back at one of the best shows we grew up with in the s
tintin and i first of all struck me as a masterpiece documentary the photography and the editing are truly breath taking almost anti dogma we follow the life of tintin drawer herg through an open hearted interview from the tintin series was drawn on the background of the great ideological fights of the twentieth century in the midst of these herg has his own demons to fight with and much of his drawing activity seems like an attempt to tame these and to escape into a world of perfection even though there are spectacular photographic panoramas of drawings from tintin albums and also some reconstructions and reading of passages from the albums the story of herg is told entirely through interviews and archive material and never through reconstructions herg lived the turbulent life of a true suffering artist but the fantastic world that came of his imagination will continue to amaze readers again and again
gender bender sexes things up a bit for the x files this episode has an interesting premise a good story but an ending that is wanting gender bender is also the x files debut for actor nicholas lea better known as alex krycek in this episode he plays michael a man attacked by one of the kindred you need to see this episode just to see nic lea s less than spectacular beginning an interesting thing about the kindred s power of seduction when marty does it to his victims they become turned onto him her however when andrew seduces scully she only because disoriented and groggy and does not become attracted to andrew maybe it s because marty has more experience at it than andrew this episode reminds me of why it would sometimes be miserable to film up in british columbia throughout the episode it is so wet soggy and muddy it could not have been that much fun despite the disappointing ending gender bender is still a decent episode to view
i liked it just that i liked it not like the animated series i love it the fact that this make less appealing is that we all try to compare and not to appreciate but this cartoon was awesome but it really didn t like it that much there s too much people talking about bruce being so cold but if this is around years later anybody in a crime fighting gang would get this angry and darker attitude so to me it isn t a flaw batgirl was awesome she really fit there as there isn t more dick grayson as a robin batman needed a good teammate not like the new robin he is just a child and you cant rely that much on a child but heres what didn t work the new artwork it isn t horrible but to me it does nt work in a series like batman this is a dark character with a maniac killer like the joker so you cant put this kind of artwork in this cartoon the joker isn t a bad design but i still like the past joker but to me the best joker ever was the one who appeared in batman beyond return of the joker so this joker isn t near as good the good thing about the joker is that it still mark hamil voice my favorite character harley quinn im in love for her they put an awesome episode for her mad love to me the best episode of this series here we finally know how she turned harley quinn and how the joker twisted her mind and it feel that atmosphere that you feel in the animated series darker no happy ending brutal fight with the joker but too short this is how it was to be all the series but in general i didn t like how she made harley in this series in almost every episode they put funny but in a ridiculous way she get punched she say nonsenses she make flaws c mon she is funny in a way you can laugh with her not from her and here they put ridiculous like i said the only episode where i don t think that its in mad love and beware of the creeper so in general its a good series it has it upsides and downs the drawn could be better my good kill that catwoman nice sound effects nice music nice voices and nice episodes my favorites mad love jokers millions old wounds sins of the father and cold comfort if you enjoyed batman tas you can watch this but don t spec too much in the other hand if you didn t watched tas watch this first and then watch tas in that way you re really gonna love tas d
what s in a name if the name is jerry bruckheimer expect it to be filled with action in producer bruckheimer s latest film gone in seconds its all about the nomenclature with character monikers like kip sway and the sphinx and cars idealized with names like diane sue and the elusive eleanor it s only the non stop action that keeps you from wanting to just play the name game not a deep script by any means but it is a great vehicle for action as nicolas cage as memphis raines along with angelina jolie and robert duvall comes out of car thievery retirement to save his brother s life by stealing a list of exotic cars in one night a remake of the cult hit this film may not be destined for the same cult status but it is entertaining surprisingly it s the action that keeps you watching not the acting although loaded with stars none of them have standout performances including a very weak performance by one of my favorite up and comers giovanni ribisi even jolie coming off her recent oscar win is just a token love interest with hardly any screen time can a series of beautiful cars and the car chases they become involved in make a great film i think so the film is a pleasure to look at and although one particular scene takes you into the realm of unbelieveablity the action is non stop and the suspense is compelling just be wary of other drivers fighting for a pole position as you leave the theatre out of
okay yes this was a very tight budget movie with continuity errors like single scenes obviously filmed in sunshine and then in shadow and then mixed together and as much as i love nick mancuso he was often a little too good at the burnt out part and some of the minor supporting cast was really bad plus at least one actor was used for two different but conspicuous roles but come on richard grieco was hysterical his hair alone is worth the trip steven ford was very likable mancuso had some great lines while nancy allen ironically was completely bland and uninteresting classic no bad parts yes entertaining big yes i would have loved to have been on set the day they decided what kind of hairstyle grieco would have are you fast y ain t that fast
a deplorable social condition triggers off the catastrophe an impoverished giovanna has ended up in the gutter but still has an ace up her sleeve beauty and youth bragana a fat bellied gas station tenant who has been getting on in years picks her up from the street and offers her bed and home together with his clumsy affection but the physical contact that giovanna is now exposed to only gives her feelings of disgust and consequently she does not see a benefactor in him but a tormentor whom she has to get rid of the arrival of gino a young migrant worker finally provides her the longed for opportunity and you don t have to ask her twice at the very first encounter she gives him the feeling of being physically desired and a little later she lets him seduce her without offering any resistance the developping partnership has to submit to the strict rules drawn up by giovanna though gino s yearning for freedom is suppressed his desire to leave the place with giovanna and start a new life far away from the fatso is pushed aside giovanna aims at another goal to get bragana killed to inherit and in addition to that to collect the insurance premium in her hands gino degenerates into a self sacrificing tool being completely at the mercy of this woman he turns into a cold blooded killer but in contrast to giovanna he questions the committed crime on a moral level the very taking over of bragana s place which includes the sleeping in the bed of a dead man causes a deep loathing of himself and later after he has found out about the forthcoming payment of the insurance money and seems to see through giovanna s cunningly devised plan he also executes a physical separation from his lover and finds comfort in the arms of a prostitute if visconti s film ended at this point it could easily be classified as a condemnatory portrait of a cool calculating and unscrupulous woman with a slight touch of social criticism but then the last sequences make this carefully built construct of ideas collapse at last giovanna feels remorseful about what she has done and by the uncompromising revelation of her innermost feelings she succeeds in inflaming anew gino s love her violent death by an absurd road accident then does not only leave him helpless at the mercy of an arbitrary fate it also affects us while we realize that none of the acting characters is to be made responsible for their disaster the culprit is just the state of a society that determines the way of the individual unalterably right from the start
i grew up with this as my all time favorite film the special effects are incredible for the era and won awards i can remember the dialogue as if i d heard it yesterday it is simply a great timeless adventure the music is by miklos rosza who is cinema history s best sabu is the thief conrad veidt is the grand villain i have a copy within reach for the next trip down memory lane whoa there rex ingram wants out of his genii bottle
i hadn t laughed this hard for a movie in a really long time the garbage that hollywood has been putting out lately drives me up a wall this one was definetely fresh and witty if you look at the demographic figures for the ratings only a few women have voted i don t want to ruin the movie for you but i m sure that every guy who saw this ran to their computers to rate it and gave it a poor score why because the movie puts men in their place that s why if more women vote for this movie because of its actual humor value and not because it is damaging to men it could easily be a rated movie
while a bit preachy on the topic of progress as the saving grace of mankind this is still a stunning film that presages the science fiction special effects blockbusters that would take another years to arrive on the silver screen it predicts the global chaos of wwii but expands on the premise by having the conflict last years and then tells the epic tale of man s struggle out from under the rubble and into the wilds of space the acting seems wooden and strangely sterile but this is perhaps a result of its contrast with the visuals which must have been utterly breathtaking at the time of the movie s release and which still impress today this is a film not to be missed by anyone at all interested in the sf genre
to anyone who might think this show isn t for them please give it a try network television has degenerated into shows that are clones of clones or are reality based shows featuring some often unreal people this show is a return to family oriented tv where the emphasis is on learning some life lessons learning what real friends and family are about and maybe even learning a little bit about our national pastime jeremy sumpter is one of the most appealing young actors in show business today and he is perfectly cast as the young slightly naive new batboy for the fictional new york empires great name dean cain christopher lloyd mare winningham and kirsten storms round out the main cast and they are all exceptional this show deserves a chance to catch on and be seen hopefully it will stick around for a few seasons and we can watch pete young sumpter s character learn and grow

jon voight plays a man named joe joe is shook up by a haunting childhood he has a strong fear and hatred of religion due to his traumatic baptism he quits his job as a dishwasher and goes out to become a hustler for wealthy people he meets a misfit named ratso dustin hoffman and the two for a relationship they go out and work together in helping each other out they become thieves the two grow remarkably close and soon can t live without each other however there is something very important that ratso hasn t told joe and it could destroy any hope they have of surviving the city together this is one of the greatest films ever made it is a heartbreaking and shattering portrait of too very lonely men who have nothing to lose but each other their story is devastating to watch but is ultimately important for people to see it s one of those films where the characters are pretty much just like the seemingly crazy people you sometimes find on the street the difference is that this film is from their perspective their lives are shown to us and it s devastating to see the pedestrians in this film treat them like dirt especially if we at one time were one of those people however the film doesn t try to guilt trip you instead it shows you the rough side of the lifestyle of hustling it is not a pleasant and easygoing lifestyle like many hollywood films portray it such as milk money and pretty woman the lifestyle of being a male hustler is a dirty gritty and ugly life and it s sad that people have degraded themselves like the character of joe in this film does what startles me the most about this film was that it came out in and it has stood the test of time perfectly today s audiences will still find great meaning in this film and will still love it and cherish it just as much as critics and audiences did everywhere in the film was rated x but what i notice about this film is that the sexuality is portrayed in a much more honest realistic and effective way anybody who has had sex before will know how humorous awkward and scary as hell it can be and this film doesn t shy away from any of that the sex in this film may not be as graphic as in once was thought to be movies that were x rated such as midnight cowboy a clockwork orange greetings last tango in paris and fritz the cat all seem remarkably tame compared to the shocking things that people can get away with an r rating today the sex scenes in midnight cowboy will seem quite strong but they certainly aren t sexy they are not graphic but they are realistic and that s what people should keep in mind when they view this film the course language that is used in the film particularly the word fag is used effectively and is not gratuitous the violence is very shocking to watch even today but again it is necessary to the plot to depict the world of a hustler i m really glad to see that midnight cowboy is not dated and is still just as affecting as it was in if not more i can t recommend this classic enough and i do hope that it continues to find an audience because it really is a very special and unforgettable experience that will not soon be forgotten pros jon voight and dustin hoffman are both harrowing and amazing to watch they have never played roles like this before or since and they are completely different from usual you ll forget who is playing them within minutes beautiful score not at all dated or campy like many films of that decade come off as today fantastic and fast editing jobcons for mature audiences only the opening scenes are well done but they could be just a little stronger
i thought this movie did a down right good job it wasn t as creative or original as the first but who was expecting it to be it was a whole lotta fun the more i think about it the more i like it and when it comes out on dvd i m going to pay the money for it very proudly every last cent sharon stone is great she always is even if her movie is horrible catwoman but this movie isn t this is one of those movies that will be underrated for its lifetime and it will probably become a classic in like yrs don t wait for it to be a classic watch it now and enjoy it don t expect a masterpiece or something thats gripping and soul touching just allow yourself to get out of your life and get yourself involved in theirs all in all this movie is entertaining and i recommend people who haven t seen it see it because what the critics and box office say doesn t always count see it for yourself you never know you might just enjoy it i tip my hat to this movie
follow the fleet an rko production in stars fred astaire and ginger rogers in a complex romantic comedy although fred astaire and ginger rogers have had many similar romantic movies together rko helped them to once again create a worth while storyline that incorporates relevant situations to society at the time it was made the narrative of follow the fleet relies heavily on the use of layered story lines between the two sets of main characters to create a satisfying romantic comedy the general plot of the movie revolves around bake baker a sailor in the u s navy played by fred astaire and sherry martin bake s former love and dance partner who is now a singer and dancer played by ginger rogers their story begins when bake is on the ship and his shipmate bilge smith finds a photo of the two of them together and bake reveals that the last time he saw her he had asked her to marry him so bilge suggests that they try and meet up with her when they are on land in hopes that she might have a friend the next major scene begins the second plot of the movie when connie martin sherry s sister is refused entry into paradise where her sister works unless she is escorted by a gentleman she turns around to find bilge behind her with a bag full of beverages so she plays it off like she was waiting on him and buys his entrance into paradise as well connie then finds sherry and tells her that she is depressed because she cannot have the luck sherry does with men so sherry suggests she get a makeover from her friends while she is performing on stage connie gets made over and enters the ballroom once again and approaches bilge again who is awestruck by the sight of her this commences the second romantic storyline between bilge and connie throughout the remainder of the movie the story and rising actions are transitioned between altering comedic reliefs of the two couples troubles that create several mini rising and falling actions within the overall plot bake and sherry hit it off their first moments together as they compete in a dance competition and end up winning it reminding them of the success and pleasure the two have when they are together similarly bilge is able to swoon connie through his romantic attempts of pleasing her and they retire to her house this series of happy events is soon followed by unsettling measures that brings the rising action back down bake left sherry the previous night to retire to the ship before midnight and told her that he would come for her in the morning unfortunately the ship sets course after the shipmates have returned upsetting sherry and leaving her to think bake was still being a typical sailor looking for a good time when he s on land the mood is again changed as another subplot is entered into the film when a party of big shots is taking a tour of the ship this alternate storyline is used to create a buffer between the stories of the two main relationships of the film as well as help build confidence and fondness of bake s overall good intentions the party is interrupted by the oblivious music playing coming from bake and his companions when they missed the sounding to report on deck for the company the ladies are intrigued and ask to hear them play and bake gladly begins to entertain them with some dancing which ultimately helps brighten the mood of the film as well as bring happiness to the sailors after returning to the couple s intertwined stories sherry is trying to prove to bake that she does not need his help with landing a job unfortunately bake is unaware that she is auditioning and goes to put in a good word for sherry when he overhears his friend at the studio talking about the remarkable lady auditioning bake takes it upon himself to help sherry out by tampering with her water making her unable to sing correctly and destroying her audition in addition to bake s mistake connie spent all of her money to repair a ship that she was hoping bilge would take over as captain she had also planned a remarkable dinner date for him when he was supposed to come over but bilge was aware of her intentions and hopes of soon marrying and was no longer interested so he stood her up the remainder of the movie continues in the same format of mini rising and falling actions until the climactic point is reached between the two couples ending the movie with the happiness of both couples the use of the altering stories helps to build interest and emotion within each couple as they deal with both happiness and pain through each of their struggles the intertwining stories are also able to relate with one another as well as incorporate other unrelated subplots to help carry the narrative through to the concluding scenes although fred astaire and ginger rogers have countless films together that incorporate romance comedy song and dance follow the fleet is a unique film for the two actors that successfully use the technique of subplots to aid the narrative between the two main characters
i won t claim to be a fan of ralph bakshi because i am not i have only watched of his animated films so far coonskin wizards fritz the cat and lord of the rings and finally fire and ice what i can claim is that i found fire and ice to be the most enjoyable of the lot it is a straightforward fantasy tale of swords and sorcery along the lines of conan the barbarian but the beautiful artwork realistic animation and lively film score effectively lends a very classic charm to this movie deserving first mention is the animation itself i do not care what people say about rotoscoping but in my opinion ralph bakshi used that technique very effectively here i was amazed at how realistic the movements of the characters were the style of directing and the photo realistic character designs made fire and ice feel more like a big budget fantasy blockbuster than a cartoon sadly the level of art detail tends to get a little inconsistent especially near the end of the movie some scenes just look really flat with little to no body contour details or fabric folds and shadows on the characters with realistic moving characters realistic action would naturally follow not only was the action well choreographed but it was really brutal i would be so bold as to compare the brutality of the action to live action movies like zack snyder s i did notice however that though there was blood shed the blood splatters were kept to a minimum again a great choice by the creative team that only heightens the viewing experience by not taking things too over the top though i do not recognize any big names in the cast the voice actors manage to deliver a satisfying performance keeping the delivery of every line realistically subdued and only hamming it up in the case of the bad guys did i say bad guys yes i did because that is exactly what the story is about a standard good vs evil tale nothing really original about the story which seems to merely be a mix of pre existing fantasy film clich s that involve scantly clad warriors and maidens anyone looking for depth would be sorely disappointed the characters are not given much development and some of them like nekron and darkwolf are one dimensional at best i did however hear rumor of some deleted scenes that explains darkwolf s obsession with killing nekron and his mother scenes like that deserved full restoration and should have been included in the final cut to add a level of depth to the show in fact i would not be surprised to find out that the whole movie was just a tech demo of sorts to showcase the awesome animation and art with the story cobbled together and thrown in as an afterthought in order to pass it off as a proper movie a true classic of a bygone era fire and ice really captures the blazing spirit of adventure and mysticism with its beautiful renderings of fantastic creatures and charming characters it is a unique vision of a world created by ralph bakshi and artist frank frazetta with a good measure of action and suspense would it hold up to animated film standards of today definitely not but i urge animation fans in general to get off your high horse and give this simple but beautiful film a chance to grow on you it is truly a gem of the s worth checking out
resident evil code veronica is a great well made video game it has great graphics very comfortable controls a great storyline and high fun factor the storyline to this is claire redfield gets taken to an island for trespassing on umbrella grounds and reaking havoc at they re main lab while looking for her brother code veronica s graphics are very good the fire and rain effects are great looking the controls are comfy but the button pattern doesnt fit the dreamcast control makeing it hard to get used to its still fun going around some wierd disturbing place shooting the guts out of zombies code veronica also has a little bit of romance between the two main characters you also get to play as chris redfield from resident evil the sound in this game is better than ever for example even though i hate the new feature when the giant spiders crawl they re feet make a disturbing scampering sound and the guns sound alot more realistic great graphics outstanding story comfy controls and realistic sound makes resident evil code veronica a definite loved i give it a out of
spoilers through i really am in the minority on this one but i liked this movie it s not a classic but it s definitely involving and quite an adrenalin fueled ride i definitely thought it was worth at least a rating perhaps the reason i liked it is because i haven t seen the original something tells me that with a movie like this it s strongest fans will be the people who have not seen the original version and thus have little to compare it to this was not a masterpiece but i did get into it quite a lot and it actually made me want to see the original there were a few things i liked about it one was the casting of kowalkski viggo mortenson was superb and really brought a lot of charisma to the role since the bulk of the movie fell on his shoulders he really needed to be excellent and he was this was a great role for him another interesting thing about vansishing point was the fact that it s made for television i had no idea this was the case when watching it it sure seemed like a major motion picture and i would never have guessed this was not a big screen release i also found the story to be very absorbing i m not one for action movies but i got sucked into this plus it was a lot more then an action movie in that there was drama mysticism a love story quirky people every which way you turned i didn t even recognize priestly and it was touching this was not a great movie but it is watchable and then there s the ending it packs a strong punch and if one s been involved in the story up to that point it s very difficult not to be transfixed at the very end i am not sure how i feel about the ending the implication was that kowalkski survived and though i m highly skeptical of how that would be possible it is a movie and realism isn t an ingredient that s always in the mix when making a movie so i d have to say i found the end incredibly unrealistic but very touching in a manipulative kind of way which i don t usually like but for some reason is almost forgivable in this movie admittedly a lot of things were just props for the plot could the villains have been anymore stereotypical but the makers got a lot right even if they got many things wrong as well however having said that i will admit i can understand why someone who s a major fan of the original would hate this version because though i have not seen the original i have seen many original movies i loved being remade with terrible results my big dislike is actually sequels but i can understand the low ratings if the original is of that high a quality people have compared this to smoky and the bandit how about a road version of legends of the fall meets thelma and louese as well i sure felt touches of both films both of which i m a fan of i do not think however that this was a great film it was better then average to me but far from great but it was an absorbing adrenalin fueled touching movie with excellent casting of the main character my vote is of
as the film opens two thugs kill another thug when the body is discovered and about to be autopsied the doctor realizes that although the man was shot dead he was also suffering from the pneumonic plague a very nasty and more virulent version of the bubonic plague so it s a race against time to find those who came in contact with the dead man and treat them immediately otherwise a disaster could erupt oddly i actually know quite a bit about the pneumonic plague as i taught a series of lectures on it for my history classes the film really did not do a good job of getting the facts right about the disease in that it looked little like what the people had in the movie the biggest problem is that this illness is so incredibly grotesque that in they really wouldn t have been allowed to show it sure there is high fever and coughing they got this right but also lots of bleeding and explosive vomiting of blackened blood along with the enormously swollen lymph nodes like you d get with the bubonic plague all purply and gross i can certainly understand why they didn t go this far also i am sure that the federal government would have had a much much greater involvement in controlling and treating the disease here in the film it was handled on a very local level and everyone seemed ill prepared and a bit dumb no one seemed willing to believe the doctors as for the acting the film had some excellent actors here richard widmark and paul douglas are respectively the public health doctor and police chief good actors but also known actors back in however in his first film is the very menacing jack palance still going by his original moniker walter jack palance as well as the relatively unknown at the time zero mostel palance was great very scary and very physically adept in his own stunts mostel played a heavy typical of his early work a greasy and cowardly sort of evil overall despite really not getting the details right and wrapping everything up a little too neatly the film is very tense and has excellent acting and is well worth seeing
i really liked this movie even though it wasn t anything like any of the books it still the that classic nancy drew style i had been seeing a lot of advertisements for this movie and since i was really into the nancy drew books i had really high expectations for this movie and they most definitely met those expectations pretty much all of the characters were exactly how i pictured them from reading the books i am really happy that i saw this movie all of the actors and actresses really acted like they acted like in the book series ever since i saw this movie i have wanted to read every single nancy drew book there is out there all of the actors and actresses really got into their characters and it definitely showed when the aired this movie on the big screen it definitely seemed like all of the actors and actresses were really in the positions that the characters were in i most definitely give this movie a out of
i remember seeing this movie a long time ago back then even though it didn t have any special effects the acting was really good and it still has the same message for today even though the technology has changed maybe they should make a remake of this movie it would be interesting to see a remake i also enjoyed the music from the movie as well larry norman was a really good songwriter during that time period although now most christian music is now worship and praise music i was always curious to know what ever happened to patty after the series ended did she go on to make more movies did she get eventually get married and raise a family i would like to have an update
a dying kung fu master sends out his last student in order to track down what happened to the previous five students who were members of the banned poison clan he is to see if they are acting for good and if not he his to stop them the master also wants the student to find another member of the clan who ran off with the clans money which the master wants used for good the earlier students were all taught in a different style snake centipede scorpion lizard toad while the last student was taught a little in each style all of the students end up in one town looking for the old man with all of the money and soon everyone is battling to get the money classic martial arts film has title that even many non fans know i ve spoken with a couple of casual fans and this seems to be the one film that sticks in their head its a very good movie though i m not really sure why this film stays with people when for my money there are other films that are better from the shaw studio one armed swordmen or the brave archer series for example this isn t to sell the film short its not since the film is structured like a mystery our hero has no clue who anyone is and the venoms themselves only know at best who two of the others is we re given the identity of four but we still have to work out who the fifth really is the film is also odd in that for a martial arts film other than a training sequence at the start and the killing of the old man and his family for the money there is really no action for about or minutes its a bold move to do it but it pays off since the plot and the performances hold your attention the film is also odd in that its the first martial arts film i think i ve ever seen where there are no women i don t think one has a speaking role and i m pretty sure that none appear in the background its indicative of nothing its just something that struck me this is a good solid little film that may not live up to the reputation it has in some circles but is still a really good film to curl up with on your couch around out of
most people who chase after movies featuring audrey tautou seem to not understand that amelie was a character it is not really audrey tautou s real life personality hence every movie she partakes in is not going to be amelie part part etc now with that said i too picked up this movie simply because audrey was in it yes it s true there is a big gap after the first scene where she isn t seen at all for maybe min but i didn t even miss her because i was having so much fun with the other characters the guy who lies about everything is too funny the guy who justifies people who run out of his cafe and skip out on the bill by finding coupons and such which balance out the loss actually getting into all the characters here could take quite a while but this is one of the best movies i ve seen in a while audrey tautou s character irene is not the overdone sugary girl that amelie was in fact as irene her rudeness to a bum asking for change caught me off guard at first in this film irene is a girl with good intentions but over the course of a very awful day her disposition becomes more and more sour and pessimistic what makes this film completely great is you have all these really interesting stories and plots building very entertaining to watch great scenery and shots very colorful and never too slow and all of the characters can actually act the best part of the movie comes with about minutes left this is when all of the plots start to mesh together and the ride really picks up and everything ties together and makes sense and the whole butterfly effect blossoms i swear it was the best minutes of film i ve seen in quite a while and the ending it made me think damn i really lucked out finding this movie the ending to this movie is top notch whoever wrote the script for this is brilliant because not only are there all these other subplots going on but to somehow make them all tie in together and in a sensible manner which is the case here but also to make each character feel human and come alive not just some stale persona used as a crutch to build up this whole butterfly effect very impressive i highly suggest this movie as it s a great film to watch anytime in any mood with any company or alone
when girlfight came out the reviews praised it but i didn t get around to seeing it i finally saw it when it got released on video and understand the glowing reviews the movie opens in a high school in the middle of a ghetto we quickly get introduced to student diana guzman michelle rodriguez she has a bad ass expression on her face and any idea about diana that we might derive from this expression soon gets corroborated when she gets in a fight as diana gets in trouble for this we then meet her father an aggressive type in his own right clearly we can t totally blame diana for her attitude but then the movie really picks up as a new thought germinates in diana s mind boxing as a way to escape this grim existence her older brother has already gotten into boxing but her father most likely won t approve only diana herself can decide what to do just the first few minutes alone identified that i was in for a very gritty non hollywood movie but the brief appearance of john sayles in a supporting role truly affirmed that even before they get to any boxing scenes you feel like you re getting pounded in the face at seeing the ugly life that diana lives and when they finally arrive at the film s main story there s no turning back all in all i definitely recommend this movie i will admit that using boxing as a means to show someone trying to make something of himself herself has been sort of a clich in cinema for many years rocky million dollar baby but i still think that they did a great job with it here in fact this may have brought the genre to its apex really good too bad that michelle rodriguez wasted herself in hollywood movies after this one
this movie was excellent a bit scary but excellent at that for those of you that have heard of columbine and know the story it gives you a idea of what and why these kids did what they did in the back of your mind you know that people think of this stuff but you never realize just how bad it is and this movie makes you realize it s seriously that good it also makes you think twice before you make fun of someone that s for sure i read a book on the columbine massacre and it made me think this movie makes me worry and scares me to death on the downside it s like a how to kill someone guide for serial killers i recently received a threat and i blew it off thinking nothing of it but after this movie i think you should take everything seriously some people are crazy and you never truly know which they are so take it seriously and don t under estimate someone
the filming is pleasant and the environment is keenly realistic i liked that it boldly redresses conceptions of the many difficult moral and social morays of the s chinese mainland countryside as well as more basic human questions i felt i could get a real sense of the times recreated even in splendid shots of traditional chinese theatre and in purist depictions of street living it seemed worthwhile to experience the interwoven role which buddhism plays is probably the most true to form both in its menial and in its philosophic aspect perhaps the most effective that i ve seen in chinese film casting is great images are memorable acting is solid enough thematically puerile but still rich enough to compliment the vehicle of its expression
perhaps the most gripping and intelligent of crooked cop movies is otto preminger s where the sidewalks ends from a really excellent script by ben hecht based on the novel night cry by frank rosenberg dana andrews is the honest tough new york policeman always in trouble with his superiors because he likes his own strong arm methods as much as he detests crooks when he hit someone his knuckles hurt and the man he wants to hit is a smooth villain gary merrill who points up the title why are you always trying to push me in the gutter he asks andrews i have as much right on the sidewalk as you dana andrew s obsession and neurosis are implanted in his hidden painful discovery that he is the son of a thief his deep hatred of criminals led him to use their own illegal methods to destroy them and the pursuit of justice became spoiled in private vendetta by a twist of irony unique to the film itself dana andrews and gene tierney of laura are united once more and andrews now seems to be playing the same detective a few years later but no longer the romantic beaten down by his job by the cheap crooks this time he goes too far and accidentally kills a suspect the killing is accidental the victim worthless yet it is a crime that he knows can break him or send him to jail using his knowledge of police procedure he covers up his part in the crime plants false clues and tries to implicate a gang leader but cannot avoid investigating the case himself the double tension of following the larger case through to its conclusion without implicating himself in the murder is beautifully maintained and the final solution is both logical satisfying and in no way a compromise the film is one of the best detective films of the s with curious moral values also one of preminger s best preminger uses a powerful storytelling technique projecting pretentious camera angles and peculiar touches of the bizarre in order to externalize his suspense in realism
i have never danced flamenco before but somehow i feel like this movie was perfect the colors how blatant the dances were the gypsies and the rivals all put together made a movie that seemed to have ended too soon i have seen other carlos saura movies and i agree that this film may be his best production i feel that the best characteristics of his past films were put together and aligned to make iberia i appreciate the use of mirrors in revealing the activity going on behind the cameras while watching this movie i felt like i was sitting in a small restaurant in madrid comfortably watching the dancers bang on a wooden plank over a delicious fruit cocktail for me this movie fit like a glove i don t know how i will be able to get a copy of this film in the us in the next few years i recommend this movie to anyone who is attracted to the livelihood of other cultures it is safe to say that this movie is certainly on my favorites list
john ford is one of the most influential and best remembered american filmmakers in the history of film his name usually associated with the western film genre however john ford s arguably best film is not a western at all but a seedy drama set in the irish fight for independence in the early s s the informer times are tough on many in ireland and the burnt out gypo nolan is caught in a web of poverty and desperation and the walls are closing in gypo is big but he is not the brightest bulb on the tree has a warm heart but a short fuse and never seems to really think things all the way through but he is not a criminal or a self centered pig walking the streets starving with no where to live the hulking gypo nolan finds the prime lady in his life katie madden on the streets soliciting herself because of her own desperate situation and starts to dream about taking her to the united states if he only had the pounds to pay for it as luck would have it his friend frankie is back in town with a pound price over his head and gypo is desperate enough to inform the police of frankie s whereabouts gypo with the new pounds of blood money earned finds this foggy night particularly foggier as guilt swells all over him and the ira invests all their resources to find frankie s informer victor mclaglen portrays the fallen gypo nolan and definitely deserved the best actor oscar he was awarded for this film his brutish stupid and tender turns give the character dimension and mclaglen is only second to dudley moore s character arthur bach from the film arthur as the most entertaining cinematic drunk margot grahame s performance as katie madden is also excellent but she and mclaglen are the only members of the cast who truly impress preston foster is especially miscast as an ira head mainly because he is most obviously not irish and j m kerrigan borders on irritating throughout his role in the film but this disappointing supporting cast is the film s only poor point often overshadowed by some of ford s better known westerns like the searchers or the man who shot liberty valance the informer is easily one of john ford s best films if not his very best beginning what would be a long career of oscar nominations and wins for john ford the informer won four oscars including one for him for best director in ford and company s use of shadows and light in the film is particularly engaging and vital to telling the story gypo s walk through the streets is narrated by the gloomy state of the town and the glaring accusations of the street lamps each shadow constantly reminding him of his dark deed ford s command of this technique was amazing to watch if the informer was made years later thus making the genre requirements it would probably be considered one of the best films noir of all time but that does not hinder it from being remembered as an excellent classic film
im not usually a lover of musicals but if i had to choose what would be my favourite it would definitely be oliver this film is so well made the characters are well depicted the costumes are spot on the acting is good and the songs are great my favourite being reviewing the situation sung by ron moody who gives a brilliant portrayal of fagin i wasn t old enough to see oliver when it was released in the late s but my sisters were so for weeks on end i had to put up with them singing the bloody songs usually it was who will buy my wonderful roses so i already knew all of the songs before i saw the film its a timeless musical you definitely couldn t remake it it stands on its own its not accurate to the book and i don t think it would have worked so well if it had been i don t think charles dickens would be disappointed as he wrote oliver to depict the poverty in london the orphanages the work houses and about what the poor had to resort to in order to survive and the film portrays this very well also another great reason to watch this film is bullseye the old type english bull terrier notice his long thin legs this was bred out of the breed many years ago they must have hunted high and low to find a specimen like him and he is exactly how an english bull terrier would have looked in victorian times notice he has scars which is probably makeup on his face bill sykes had probably used him for dog fighting or for the rat pit a victorian bull terrier had a record amount of kills in a rat pit his a beautiful dog any way and notice he disobeys bill sykes after he has killed nancy he obviously has his standards his not the chunk head bill sykes thought he was this is a great musical to watch if you like musicals and if you don t like musicals give it a try any way there s something for everyone in this film
if you still remember that summer when you had your first kiss first boy girlfriend or first puppy love fling this film is for you ok so this movie would and will never win an oscar but as a dominican i loved it there are some things in the movie that might just go right over your head if you are not part of the culture the kids being raised by a grandma who s both mother and father the youngest son being babied and bathed with a cafe bustelo tin sooo dominican judy being harassed by the neighborhood men going to church and lighting a prayer candle the film s brilliance was in those small details granted it was not a pull out all the works cinematic extravaganza but it wasn t meant to be nor was it meant to be an educational tool for those wanting to learn about latin culture tip make new friends instead more of a bitter sweet faux cumentery this film kept it real without taking itself too seriously as in the tradition of y tu mama tambien this was simply one boy s coming of age tale i recommend it especialmente si eres dominicano o
i realized a couple of days ago that the makers of this film put a play on words into its title this movie is not primarily about the act of riding giants but mostly about the people who are the giants of the sport riding giants to change the emphasis in my teens i lived a block from the wedge one of the hardest breaking and best bodysurfing spots in the world i ve been out in to foot surf and have ridden and been hammered by and foot waves on many occasions that experience is why i am in complete awe of the surfers in this film the idea that jeff clark to all appearances a normal mortal could get away with riding maverick s by himself for over a decade is beyond my grasp the first safety rule of any water sport is never surf dive swim by yourself he went where sane people would not and lived to tell about it i wouldn t go out there if the water were degrees and the sharks all left in the world of warm water the first shot of the waves at jaws always makes the skin tingle over my entire body these are not just scary waves these are uncontrolled bowel evacuation waves when we see laird hamilton not only surviving to foot waves i can hardly type those numbers but actually working the faces like a fun day at rincon i m blown away there is a dedication and focus in big wave riders which is comparable to that of anyone in the world this a great film i gave it a instead of a only because it neglects to mention that there are great big wave riders in the world outside the hamilton kalama crew and i think they deserved mention splice in ken bradshaw at outside log cabins and a it is
sure this movie is sappy and sweet and full of clich s but it s entertaining and that s what i watch movies for to be entertained natasha henstridge is stunning even with the short hair her smile is radiant and her beauty can t be disguised as for michael vartan i m sure the women love him the two of them seemed to really like eacb other in this film i don t understand the comments that there was no chemistry between them i guess we see what we want to see olivia d abo and michael rigoli were fun to watch even if d abo s british accent did creep into her supposed bronx speech to tell you the truth i hadn t really noticed it until i read these comments but i went back to the dvd and now her dialogue sounds more british than american to me but she was ideal for her role with that one exception it s a story of two nice people who are getting married to significant others but who find their soul mates in one another it may be an unlikely story but who says movies are all supposed to play like documentaries it is no more unrealistic than any of the dramas that are screened every hour on the tube that s why we watch them to escape from the humdrum of daily living for a short time and enter the world of the characters on the screen i thought these actors did a good job of it but hey i m a sentimental guy who tears up easily don t get me wrong though it has to be a sentimental scene and this movie had plenty of those i give it only because i m saving my for that yet unseen super magnificent movie that i know will come along some day if you see it advertised as coming up on the movie channel or lifetime movies or whatever make a note to watch it i think you ll like it
the man who directed the third man also directed the who will buy sequence in oliver now that is talent i raise my hat to carol reed i know there are second units involved but still and he had to deal with orson welles and oliver reed i suppose quality will out it does show in the final scene with nancy avoiding spoiler everyone has to see oliver for the first time sometime how many lines do i need to type encouraging people to type too much is not to be encouraged i hope this counts as the th line
the most agile fat guy in martial arts does it again an early sammo film that has him imitating his character s hero bruce lee sammo is amazingly lee like in his actions and fighting the way he slips into bruce s style and then back to his own more familiar kung fu is a joy to watch and shows how accomplished and adaptable he is at his art throw in a bit of slapstick humour so beloved of this type of flick and this a movie that has it all comedy some unintentional like the fake black guy action and some incredible fight scenes a great beer and buddies movie that is worth an hour and a half of anyone s time
halloween is a film i have to get out and watch every time it s that day of the year i even watch it sometimes when it s not the holiday this film is so great jamie lee curtis is an actress i can never stop loving this movie might be old but the story line still gets me right there every time and the acting was absolutely fantastic although i have not seen the remake i feel already that it was totally unnecessary i think rob zombie should have never remade such a classic what kills me though is to know that there are some people out there who have seen the remake without even hearing of the original i am getting furious just thinking about it this movie was great and it will always be remembered in history as a classic
i haven t watched the movie yet but can t wait to see it it seems very interesting and inspirational it was one of the most interesting trailers i ve ever seen the questions it posed really stopped me and made me think the unique approach to the sport of boxing as a metaphor for the battle within thank god somebody is hitting another angle with the boxing thing this film looks so fresh and smart and the actor is really hot i especially enjoyed the short clip with the actor from the rocky movies really clever i thought that the topic selected overcoming adversities and childhood traumas is timeless and god knows a lot of people need it bring it on
the story is about ankush abhay deol who is professional marriage witness in short he acts as a witness for couples in marriage registration office and megha soha ali khan who ran away from her home at nainital to get married to her love interest dhiraj shayan munshi the story starts with megha waiting at the marriage registration office for dhiraj to show up but for some reason he does not show up so ankush comes in the picture here who had approached megha with the intention of earning rs for his witness job and he ends up helping her by providing shelter to her ankush grows on his side by working in a bank as an agent ankush falls in love with megha and she too falls in love with him or kind of love both agree for the marriage and dhiraj comes back in the picture unexpected circumstances happen actually i should say expected circumstances with unexpected reactions and then actually the movie story is bit different than the movies we see and i do not think so it will be accepted by the masses but if you are a movie freak like me and love to watch something different then you will definitely like the movie the movie is just an innocent love story drafted very well by the characters of abhay deol and soha ali khan the characters are so natural that you feel as if things are happening to the guy next door the background music of the film also plays a very good role it is just too good the way delhi is shown is very good and gives a fresh feeling so let s cut it out and sum it up story a very common story carried very well and transformed to a wonderful experience music well as it was himesh reshammiya creation so i did not expect much but still i liked couple of songs of the movie including the qawwali acting abhay deol was the most impressive very natural and innocent acting but he should stay away from singing in the songs soha ali khan she is a doll a very cute doll i must say again very innocent and natural acting and these both actors perfectly fit into their characters apart from these two shayan munshi needs some acting lessons and may be few layers of fat to cover the bones other actors did their job well stars i would also give it stars out of you will enjoy the movie if watched in the theatre i would recommend watching it in theatre if you are a movie freak and accept uncommon stories otherwise wait for the dvd to arrive the movie will definitely won t be liked by the masses and the business it can do is from word of mouth publicity
dark comedy gallows humor how does one make a comedy out of murder it can be risky business as the viewer is required to let go of their moral values and laugh at the antics of a man who kills people so the story has be rock solid with a good dash of suspended reality in order to make it work so pierce brosnan the irishman s answer to is now cast as a chain smoking sex addicted alcoholic who kills people for a living and is having a life crisis he meets a struggling businessman greg kinnear and after a rocky beginning he learns that he needs a friend but greg s happily married to hope davis and brosnan sees in him the basic things he doesn t have love home and a life add character actor philip baker hall as the hit man s manager and we re off to the races brosnan is wonderfully crass and crude as the anti hero and kinnear delightful as his counterpart the very human businessman hope davis adds a sparkle as kinnear s very conventional wife who is fascinated with this derelict who drifts into their lives the ending is delightful and with some surprise to it you should leave the theater feeling at least partly good if you re able to suspend being aghast at killing people
another episode from childhood that as an adult i look back on with a different perspective this was one of my favorite childhood episodes one that really cemented my adoration of this show however on viewing this episode after years i d say it is definitely one of the lighter ones played for laughs and amusement instead of the dramatic and well constructed story lines in previous episodes in this their first and best season perhaps this episode was written for a little fan r r too as mr spock would say the story just isn t logical but there are some amusing lines like of course mr spock s final one at the end when he asks the captain mccoy et al whether they enjoyed their r r and they answer in the affirmative he raises an eyebrow and says fascinating in only the way mr spock could do that an interesting story line of course the idea of an amusement park being actually amusing instead of the fake and often annoying amusement of disneyland for example being able to have one s wishes actually come true really a great idea but not that well executed and coming from theodore sturgeon another of the great sf short story writers they used in the first season one wonders how much tinkering was done to the script that sturgeon turned in now here is a little trivia i learned on this very site in james gunn established the theodore sturgeon award for best short science fiction story and i ll quote the rest from this site in he sturgeon wrote the joy machine a third script for the star trek tv series amok time the other that was never shot the main reason that it wasn t used in the series is that it contained expensive special effects sequences that would be too much for their budget however the script was adapted into a book by sci fi writer james gunn star trek the original series and published by pocket books in i d sum this up to say this episode is still very enjoyable especially if one doesn t think too much about it just laugh and enjoy it and next episode we can get back to the serious stuff of protecting the universe
i remember when i first saw this short i was really laughing so hard that like with a lot of other films that i have seen no sound came out curly is really great at singing opera in this one i am surprised that he did not consider a career as a professional singer because he was really good if you noticed this was filmed near the end of curly s career as a stooge you could really tell he had changed because he had lost weight and was thinner his voice was deepening his face was getting lined with wrinkles though he still could pull it off he looked like he was fifty at the age of forty this was because he was suffering many minor strokes before his big one that ended his career be he still managed to pull it off in his last ones if you don t mind the fact that curly was really getting very ill at this point this is actually one of their funniest shorts i know that i didn t mind the fact that curly was really changing because i still thought that he was great
this film was enjoyable but for the wrong reasons the co ordination of the action sequences are laughable and make the film have some funny slap stick moments robert ginty and fred williamson have a memorable scene together near the end where williamson says to ginty you sure do get around buddy boy i did enjoy this film only for ginty and williamson but not for the storyline that must have been written on the back of a napkin in four lines and the rest ad libbed most likely a film with over parts only has a credit list for or so it seems odd that no one else has a credit in the film maybe they had some insight into how the finished product would look the one thing this film does have going for it is that it is quite violent so that tripled with fred williamson and robert ginty make for a film worth seeing
can scarcely imagine a better movie than thishey before you all go chick flick on me i am a very large strong masculine macho man who happens to think this was one of the better movies of the last years the acting was superb and the story was marvelous this is wonderful medicine for the heart and soul the acting could not have been better nor the movie better cast i have known for a good while that mercedes ruehl along with holly hunter joan plowright dame edith evans sissy spacek judi dench is among the greatest actresses ever to appear on film and of course cloris leachman also in this film in my view may in fact exceed them all in the shear magnum of her talent and varied roles she has appeared in over the years at any rate this was an amazing cast this film was like a book that you cannot lay down and when you have reached the last page wish for more still more i cannot for the life of me understand why this film here on the imdb only rates a that rating here is utterly amazing to me or perhaps not perhaps in fact i do understand it ever so well and that is what makes me really sad it makes me ever so sad that films like american beauty leaving las vegas sexy beast and fight club ratings skyrocket off the charts in popularity when they in fact at least in this viewers opinion should have received an r rating r that is for rubbish hey o k i realize there are a lot of different stories in this world for a lot of different audiences but it is a sad commentary when this lovely powerful extraordinarily directed acted and written film seems to be over looked it obviously was at the academy awards as well how sad and how predictable my summation is that if you want to see a powerful happy sad beautiful story watch preferably own this film
this movie is plain fun i has nothing to do with the original america pie but it is fun to watch another try but better than band camp and the naked mile at least funnier just after first five minutes i was laughing my ass out so i decided to call my friend and we would watch it together we had a few beers and we had fun you will not find any deep message in this movie but it s worth watching so lay back and just enjoy
i read several mixed reviews and several of them downright trashed the movie i originally became interested in this project because it was being directed by tony scott and i have become very interested in his work after man on fire had such a profound impact on me before i start my review let me first say this it s wonderful to see that this movie could have been told in a boring and ordinary manner yet the writers and scott chose a different approach plot simply stated it s not boring most hollywood movies give tried and true plots that they know will connect with people often ensuring the audiences acceptance of the film and creating a higher probability of profit this plot was one of the more interesting ones i had seen in a while just for reference i recently watched the weather man and lord of war and while i will say that these movies are excellent and i enjoyed them both tremendously both the plots in these movies are boring and they are told exactly how you would expect them to be told they don t take any chances whatsoever and they are extremely predictable after you ve watched a fair amount of american films domino s plot is both interesting and told in a manner that keeps you thinking oh man they re screwed now and i feel that has been lacking in a lot of recent films it has a lot of depth to it in my opinion and gives you plenty of things to question while watching it overall this is what kept me so interested in the movie characters i felt that the characters were accurate knightley did a wonderful job of portraying a beautiful woman who was anything but on the inside and wanted to be viewed as what she was it was obvious that she wanted to prove herself and she took whatever means she had to accomplish that choco was also very believable his use of spanish in inappropriate situations his reactions to domino s lack of affection as well as his jealousy issues within the team they all rang true to me which made me feel that his character was that much more realistic rourke s character was the least interesting to me but it still rang true to me he seemed like an ordinary guy trying to make ends meet i hope that s what the filmmakers were trying to accomplish with him because that s what i got out of it he did a very good job of showing ed in an average joe kind of way that has made his mistakes yet is still trying to live claremont ladies i believe that they provided much needed heart to the story they weren t just people who are out getting money to buy a bentley these were real people who had a real problem and they sought others mean to accomplish that goal you could empathize with them because to them this child s illness was a problem with no other solution these characters were supposed to show real people who are less fortunate who got into this mess because they needed help the mobsters they made the story seem sinister in a way that only the mob can and i really liked that part they also padded the story with small intricacies that made the plot that much more interesting christopher walken guys they provided the comic relief in an otherwise very serious movie from walken s awkward statements to the ceaseless references to the guys being has beens their involvement in the movie only made it that much more enjoyable cinematography yes the cinematography this is where this movie seems to have lost a lot of potential fans but in my opinion i thought it was genius the use of the camera to translate the mood of the current situation was extremely effective in my opinion i considered it a method that was properly realized but could always use improvement just like anything else i both applaud and congratulate scott the editor the cinematographer and the director of photography on taking some real chances with this movie not only did they go far and above with its presentation they went that much further the use of colors both extremely light and extremely dark provided the look of the film with a sinister and grungy look that accurately depicts the life of the mob bounty hunters and the less fortunate in a manner that show that their life isn t as peachy or clean as everyone else if you notice in times of less stress or conflict there were very few camera tricks if any at all this shows that scott and his crew were trying to achieve something with this look and weren t just doing it for the heck of it i realize that most people who watched this movie weren t expecting it and it cause many of them to be turned off to this film but i think it was great that scott took this approach hollywood films have grown predictable and bland most of them are shot in the same manner with the same twists and turns and i m glad that scott tried to make something different granted this movie isn t for everyone but to say it s trash and has nothing to offer is completely missing the point i thoroughly enjoyed this film and i m glad that i spent the money for it i would recommend this to all but i m sure it will only hit a chord with few i must agree with an earlier poster when he said that many of those who refuse to see outside the sphere of mtv won t appreciate this movie but i think many people will we should all try to enjoy it for the fact that scott and co took some chances and tried to deliver something that was different and unique and with that in mind i think he succeeded tremendously
i had started to lose my faith in films of recent being inundated with the typical genre hollywood film story lines fail and camera work is merely copied from the last film of similiar taste but then i saw zentropa europa and my faith was renewed not only is the metaphorical storyline enthralling but the use of color and black and white is visually stimulating the narrator max von sydow takes you through a spellbounding journey every step of the way and engrosses you into europa we have all seen death put on screen in a hundred thousand ways but the beauty of this film is how it takes you through every slow moving moment that leads you to death unlike many films it doesn t cut after one second of showing for example a knife but forces you to watch the devastating yet sensuous beauty of a man s final moments i think we can all take something different away from what this movie is trying to say but it is definitely worth taking the time to find out what it all really means i would love to talk more in depth about the film for any one who wishes to send me an email enjoy it
one night i stumbled upon this on the satellite station bravo initially out of curiosity i decided to watch it to be perfectly honest i wasn t disappointed the main character is beautiful and her body is shown off well you would think her talents would be wasted as a executioner but apparently not after watching the whole film my only real gripe is the acting of the supporting cast particularly the actor who plays melnik christ its bad the prison guard hank is woeful too all he ever does is get drunk and make ill attempted passes at his co guard wanda though fortunately for us the viewer and for hank he gets down and dirty with wanda near the end the music used is pretty tense and creates the perfect atmosphere for the executions this movie is well watching alone for the beautiful talented and very sexy jennifer thomas
this movie is just so good despite carmen electra this has to be one of the better films i have seen in awhile jamie kennedy is just amazing and loren dean plays an insane spoiled movie star very well the plot is great as well it s all very real which is scary it says here that it s a drama but this is one of the damn funniest dramas i have ever seen go check it out
the japanese run lola run his is one offbeat movie which will put a smile on just about anyone s face fans of run lola run tampopo go and slacker will probably like this one it does tend to follow a formula that is increasingly popular these days of separate seemingly unrelated vignettes all contributing the the overall story in unexpected ways catch it if you see it otherwise wait for the rental
i enjoyed every moment of this beautiful film and was intrigued about this female painter i had never heard of before so i set out exploring her life and work afterwards as could be expected i found out that the film was not exactly historically accurate i was a little astounded however by the very negative comments on the film because of this inaccuracy come on guys a film isn t and shouldn t be a biography nor a novel any historical film distorts reality because it should be a work of art in its own right a film director is fully entitled to use elements from reality and history to create a world of his own artemisia is a wonderful film and i think it brought many people including some that now give negative comments to explore the life and work of this fascinating artist
i thought it was a pretty good movie and should have been released in theaters first it wouldn t have been a big blockbuster but it would have made some pretty good money the movie has suspense and makes you wonder just how much of this is going on in the real world justin timberlake did a good job i wasn t expecting justin timberlake to do that good a job considering it is his first movie he did a good job this is a movie that is good to pick up and watch when you just don t know what you want to rent that night it should go pretty well the cast was great so i highly recommend that everyone checks this movie out
this movie is about two guys who made up a sport on the spot trying to get get the hot chick baseketball becomes a nationwide sport joe cooper trey parker is the beloved captain but is hated when he loses the nba to some other rival team he meets the girl of his dreams yasmine bleeth and in the end they kiss the first time i saw this movie i wet my pants it was so funny a definite must see for all comedy fans if you love south park you ll love this maybe don t watch with kids it is bit inappropriate for little dudes some duds give it out of ten i give it out of ten i like coop he rocks i gotta go bye bye thanks for reading this
i can t see the point in burying a movie like this in sulfuric sarcasm when it is in no way intended to be anything more than a vehicle to entertain children and prepare them for the next line of merchandise to beg madly about this is a fun movie my children sat quietly through the entire thing and loved every minute of it granted the villain is a bit over the top with his silly costume and maniacal laugher but this is a lot more easier to take than the dark gloomy and very morbid pokemon my children have been watching pokemon since it started and they are soon getting to the ages where they will put off the childish things and move on to others i am glad that we got to enjoy this together
the ogre doesn t seem to have won itself a very good reputation since its release in and i guess a reason for that may be down to the fact that it was given the subtitle demons in order to help it sell better well the film is directed by lamberto bava the man behind the first two demons films and ogres and demons are somewhat alike in that they re both monsters anyway but other than that this film has no connections to the other two films it is however rather good italian filmmakers are famous for ripping off popular films and while it s not completely obvious it seems to me that this one has taken a fair bit of influence from hellraiser the plot focuses on a female horror writer who moves with her husband and son to a castle in italy she is haunted by memories from when she was a child and found an ogre living in her basement it s not long after moving into the castle before these visions return and it may be more than just a coincidence as she comes to believe there s a murderous ogre living in the basement the film was obviously shot on a budget and it was made for italian tv so it would be unrealistic to expect something brilliant but for what it is this is certainly a very decent horror film lamberto bava may not have as keen an eye as his father mario did but he takes time in building up a foreboding atmosphere that really compliments the film well the central setting a large castle makes the perfect place for a story like this to take place in and lamberto makes the best of it even if it does involve ripping off superior films at times such as the inferno style pool scene the plot itself is not quite as good as the atmosphere as several scenes are drawn out far too long and the relationship between the characters is rather strange particularly between the husband and wife there s not a great deal of bloodshed but bava does get to do a little bit with the special effects the ogre itself looks really silly and it s a good job that we don t get to see it very often we do boil down to a fitting if highly predictable ending and overall i have to say that this film is much better than expected and comes recommended
the next to last episode aired of the original star trek series is an interesting sometimes melancholy installment that proves the show was still exploring its characters even at this point in the third season though flawed all our yesterdays has its moments and overall a moody compelling feel to it kirk spock and mccoy beam down to a planet assuming they are arriving in the nick of time to save or at least give some warning to whatever populace is there since the planet s sun is due to explode within hours but as it turns out the people there are all too aware of the planet s fate and using a kind of time travel device have escaped into the past each person has been able to choose the time and place in the past where he or she would like to live at a library run by an elderly man named mr atoz atoz assumes the three men are looking for a past to live in as well and shows them various periods from which they can choose on viewers there is some rather forced confusion at the start of the episode with lines like mccoy where did they go atoz wherever they wanted to the misunderstanding could be cleared up rather easily but for plot purposes it isn t and soon kirk finds himself transported back to a period resembling th century england while spock and mccoy are sent to an ice age years in the planet s past from here the main focus is on spock and his relationship with a woman exiled to this time by a tyrant as punishment spock begins acting increasingly emotional showing anger toward mccoy and deep affection for zarabeth the woman he eventually realizes that he is reverting back to the primitive emotional state of his ancestors on vulcan years ago kirk makes his way back to the library first and finally convinces mr atoz they don t belong in his planet s history spock and mccoy return just before it s too late leaving zarabeth behind the enterprise beams the three up and speeds away as the sun explodes destroying the planet the interaction between spock and zarabeth provides this episode s most memorable moments though kirk s adventure into the english past is amusing all in all a very decent latter day star trek outing
our imp of the perverse did good his first time out thats for sure the music is the best you may ever hear by any human but you already know that unless you have no taste or have a brain that is too small to understand greatness a poor script that doesn t flesh out much of a story but at least it has its moments the breathtaking concert stuff is worth seeing it he deserved an oscar for this s t even though he was at times an ego driven twit with his towering bodyguard chick huntsbery always in front a movie that made non fans fans take it or leave it prince does need to stay clear of acting in the future though he takes himself way to serious he is a genius musician but pleaseee just enjoy the ride my purple maestro peace
full house is a great family show however after watching some episodes over and over again i ve realized that they re incredibly boring and they seem to shelter themselves from the outside world a lot yes there is a lot of comedy but there are times when it s incredibly cheesy it s not like i hate it but just don t watch them over and over again because they get old quick probably the best season is the first full house is about widower danny tanner bob saget and his three daughters d j candace cameron stephanie jodie sweetin and michelle mary kate and ashley when danny s wife dies the he is in need of some help so his best friend joey dave coulier and the girls uncle jesse john stamos moves in with them once they live there together they find they can t live without each other full house reminds you just how important family is and that you can always go home again
from very long we are seeing movies on gandhi and mostly the light is always on portrayal of gandhi as freedom fighter or man with principles but when i heard that a movie is being made which will highlight gandhi as father and stress on his relationship with his son it instantly hit my attention as this is one territory which is least being explored as it has his own dark side and less people shown courage to dwell into it fortunetly anil kapoor producer and feroz abbad khan director did the story start with gandhi working in south africa and his relationship with white people and his wife latter akshay harilal joined his father for becoming a barrister but his dream took overturn when his father gandhi pushed or motivate him to become freedom fighter it showcase that gandhi believes more on practical study rather then formal education harilal too try to walk on his father footstep but soon failed as its infatuation towards his wife children and his own dream of becoming big success altered his path and then start the repulsion between son and father he finally defeated his father in terms of pursuing his dream and to left him on his own terms he written back to india but then start his unsuccessful stories which become bigger and bigger with time i am leaving reader to see movie to catch further story performance first akshay he has given best performance of his tenure so far and is absolutely convincing in his portrayal as harilal gandhi the scene in which he reach the room where his wife dead body is placed is one where you can see a fine actor which is hidden developing in akshay darshan jariwala is also good as mk gandhi and able to live up such a larger then life character he performed well and with quite an ease shefali chaya now shah as kasturba is brilliant actress and already proved her metal in tv serials bhumika chawla too performed well but actress of her candidature is waste in these kinds of role other actor have also justifies their performances technique and make up is also good and cinematography especially that duo tone color picturisation was too good costume looks and match with context overall a worth seeing movie which is defiantly slow in progress and impatient people may find it boring but give you an insight of area which is not brought to silver screen till date also the way story progress and connection of scene may look worn to some people and to critics especially but for an average movie watcher like me it still enough to make me occupied on my seat till end
i saw this on a cantonese vcd with the english subtitles i thought the story was good but there were times when some of the subcharacters were grossly over acting this took away from the film as did the fairly lame musical score which really irked me throughout the entire movie if the musical score was improved i could overlook the few overacted scenes then the film would be much much better
when my year old daughter and her friends get together for movie night there s one movie they insist on watching over and over again you guessed it k the third installment in the highly successful k franchise starring everybody s favorite tv dad jim belushi folks i knew it was possible to wear out a vhs tape but a dvd this has been played so often that it s starting to skip no joke but of course you ll have that when you own a film so charming so brilliant of course we have to thank the one and only tom hanks for introducing us to the beloved cop dog genre with turner and hooch however even that film doesn t measure up to the sheer excellence presented in all three k movies some nay sayers say belushi ran out of steam with this third movie in the series poppycock i say while you might suspect that a third installment direct to video at that may not seem like something worth watching you d prove yourself wrong after watching this quality movie i won t give away the plot but i will say that belushi and his panting partner give their best performance yet one that will have you howling with laughter it s a shame john belushi isn t alive to see what great strides his brother has made in the acting world i highly recommend your teenage daughter introduces this film to her bffs at her next slumber party don t forget the puppy chow
in this send up of horror films s cold war paranoia reagan era america and high school films adam arkin plays tony the star quarterback of full moon high in the s he and his father ed mcmahon travel to communist romania and while he s lost in the streets one night he is bitten by a werewolf when he returns stateside he cannot control his animalistic urges and goes on a killing spree frustrated he flees town decades later the immortal tony returns to town and re enrolls in highschool he still can t control his transformations and the townspeople and his friends realize he s not quite human it all culminates during the schools big football game i expected this to be one of those so bad it s good films from the early s but i was surprised that the film was actually legitimately funny the cast including kenneth mars as a pervy coach roz kelly as tony s lusty former flame demond wilson as a bus driver and alan arkin as a oddball doctor go all out with hilarious results while watching this film i was struck by how similar the writing and humor were to family guy full moon high has that same anything goes attitude and never takes itself seriously
the plot of this film might not be extraordinary but what makes the film really special are its characters and the actors who play them of course i won t go into the details of the plot of the movie but i would certainly like to say this this film is not just for everyone the film is really witty and you need to be equally clever to get all the satire if you re not alert even for a second you ll probably end up missing one of the subtle points the movie is full of such seemingly trivial but witty stuff like the announcements going on in the background at turaqistan the advertisements on the tankers which i almost missed and it are these that make the movie hilarious throughout coming to the actors john cusack has played his multi faceted role very efficiently what with him being the co writer and the producer too and he plays his character hauser the killer with a heart exquisitely cusack s done a similar kind of role before in grosse pointe blank but his comic disposition in the movie is simply superb however the actress who steals all the show is hilary duff i have always been a huge fan of ms duff but to be honest i was a bit disappointed when i heard about the kind of role she s playing in the movie but after watching the movie the disappointment gave way to great respect for her as an actor let s face it the kid s growing but yes so is her talent all those critics who shouted hoarse that hilary cannot act will be silent for a while hilary had to play a really complex character tough on the outside yet a sweet child on the inside and she s done complete justice to it she makes you laugh and she makes you cry to cut the long story short cause i could go on raving about her for ever she s brilliant marisa tomei and joan cusack have done a good job too especially joan s hysterics are uproarious however i was rather disappointed with ben kingsley being wasted in such a small role and his performance seemed lackluster in general war inc keeps you on your toes throughout with its intelligent humor and ends with just the right amount of twists in the plot i would highly recommend this movie to all and more so to hilary duff fans p s i am really glad to hear the movie is going to break free of its limited release and release at other places soon
this movie is really funny the general is keaton s finest work but there are many of his works that are more hilarious in this one are multiple sight gags and creative humor we watch it over and over and it only seems to get funnier
this is what i wrote to some friends earlier holy crap the grudge is honest to god one of the scariest films i ve ever seen i am either getting very soft in my old age or sam raimi and ghost pictures did a kick a job can t wait for boogeyman i was very scared sitting in the dark theater and wished i had someone anyone sitting next to me except the protagonist in grudge i saw the movie by myself i swear there were many many jump scenes that were not expected i felt foolish but my nerves did not care i was on edge the entire movie from the opening credits and the music was fantastically scary i keep thinking of that sound though and i do not like it i actually gasped aloud a few times and cried oh at one scene oh yeah i even half covered my eyes a few times word to the wise though i thought some of the scenes were a little psychotic my dh hated event horizon and thought whoever wrote it was sick and psycho but i don t remember the movie so can t compare i can t say i enjoyed this movie b c i was terrified but it was very very good and scary the ending scene too whoa for being a year old mommy i think i may have nightmares from this movie especially because of that sound please get out of my head in summary this is not a slasher flick like i grew up with jason freddy this is a most of the time spooky movie perfect for halloween two great trailers for this movie were boogeyman and the ring
this movie was directed by victor nunez who also wrote the screenplay ulee s gold nice and straightforward writing that was nominated for the independent spirit award looking at ruby s day to day life what we see is a slice in the life of the young woman ruby ashley judd sisters won the independent spirit award best female lead for this role ruby is starting to live on her own and establishing her own identity she explores jobs friendships boy friends sex a typical young adult search the movie won grand jury prize at the sundance film festival as an independent film enthusiast i picked the movie because of sundance i appreciate this type of movie because it does not carry the hollywood baggage although the stories are completely different this reminded me of nobody s fool staring paul newman the later movie is a slice of the daily life of a common man i like that the story is very nicely told and all we had to do was sit and enjoy the story the only thing i am not sure about is the title i am sure that there are not that many bugs and flies in paradise as there are in florida as i am allergic to mosquitos florida is no paradise to me i itch all over thinking about florida i turn into a complete red boil i recommend this movie favorite scenes ruby and her friend rochelle bridges played by allison dean walking at the beach of panama city florida indeed the sand is very white i have been there favorite quotes necessity has always been a good excuse all that fuss over finding a man is not at all different now who is going to be and when and why
obviously a film that has had great influence not only on the buddy genre but action genre as well george lucas had to be a fan of this flick as so much of his star wars series seems to a homage to gunga din the characters that grant mclaglen and fairbanks play are just precursors of han solo luke skywalker and chewbacca even sam jaffe s gunga din morphed into c po and r d and like him or not jar jar binks today this film is viewed as non pc but there is a speech by eduardo ciannelli as guru the leader of the indian opposition to the british raj that could can be echoed in the sentiments of many today to a young boy this was a great film three strong male leads and only a hint of romance there was a time when young boys deemed kissing the girl in saturday matinee film was just mush not like today when the more skin is greeted with delight too late to lament lost innocence hopefully this film will not be forgotten and a few who are channel surfing will stop at tcm and catch a film with action adventure and a cast of thousands instead of cgi actors
ruby in paradise is a beautiful coming of age story about a young woman ruby lee gissing escaping her stifling roots to become herself although the title character is played artfully by the gorgeous ashley judd in likely her first movie role albeit one to be quite proud of the emphasis is not upon becoming somebody a la the next madonna whether jesus mother or the lurid attention hungry singer it instead emphasizes following ones instincts and being somewhat introspective about them to grow into one s ideal adult self note this isn t an action movie it uses an occasional voice over narration by ms judd while writing in her journal and oh i see i ve just lost the male half of the readers out there but be patient with this beautiful movie where we learn that one s bliss can be discovered in oh i dunno carrying water and chopping wood actor director writer todd field who played nick nightingale in eyes wide shut co stars as ruby lee s noble love interest one who helps her heal her idea of relationships implanted from youth but not even his character is the answer for ruby lee there s no external hero imposed upon her the ultimate message is that we are responsible for ourselves writer director victor nunez who also wrote directed ulee s gold did an amazing job showing a young woman growing into herself confronting age old challenges of good v evil along the way the supporting cast is also stellar and the music used particularly the cuts by chanteuse sam phillips whom i hear is the wife of t bone burnett is right on most especially trying to hold on to the earth now when i hear the first few chords of that song tears spring to my eyes pavlovian and unbidden not sure if it s the music or the indelible connection to the movie s quiet charming message of empowerment this movie is highly recommended for any young person trying to find his her way for any woman of any age it is a must see the downside it is not on dvd except in spanish we learned however that it is legal to make one copy of a vhs version which can be readily found online my beloved husband found someone with a vhs copy and got a dvd copy made for me although this treasure of a movie occasionally pops up on air on an indie channel usually you can t count on that when you might need it most as a tonic to soothe the pressures of the world so buy a copy for yourself this movie should have a major re release and it would if i were queen of hollywood figgy jones
the movie macarthur begins and ends at gen douglas macarthur s gregory peck alma mata the us military academy of west point on the hudson we see a frail year old gen macarthur give the commencement speech to the graduating class of about what an honor it is to serve their country the film then goes into an almost two hour long flashback on gen macarthur s brilliant as well as controversial career that starts in the darkest hours of wwii on the besieged island of corregidor in the philippines in the early spring of told to leave he island for australia before the japanese military invade it gen macarthur for the very first time in his military career almost disobeys a direct order from his superior us president franklin d roosevelt dan o herlihy feeling that he ll be deserting his men at their greatest hour of need macarthur reluctantly together with his wife and young son did what he was told only to have it haunt him for the reminder of the war it was that reason his escape under fire from death or captivity by the japanese that drove gen macarthur to use all his influence to get fdr two years later to launch a major invasion of the philippians instead of the island of formosa to back up his promise to both the philippine people as well as the thousands of us pows left behind that he ll return and return with the might of the us army navy to back up his pledge in the two years up until the invasion of the philippine islands gen macarther battered the japanese forces in the south pafific in a number of brilliantly conceived island hop battles that isolated and starved hundreds of thousands of japanese troops into surrender the general did that suffering far less us military losses then any other allied commander in the war in the pacific it was in in the korean war that gen macarthur achieved his most brilliant victory as well as his worst military defeat after outflanking the advancing north korean army in the brilliant and perfectly executed with the invading us marines suffering less then casualties back door or left hook invasion of inchon gen macarther feeling invincible sent the us un forces under his command to the very border along the yalu river of communist red china told by his subordinates that he s facing the threat of a massive ground attack by communist chinese troops gen macarthur pressed on anyway until that attack did materialized cutting the us un forces to ribbons the unstoppable wave after wave of attacking red chinese troops forced the us un forces to retreat in the big bug out of with their very lives leaving all their equipment behind across the north korean border even abandoning the south korean capital city of seoul this turned out to be one of the biggest military disaster in us history with the us forces losing a record in the korean war lives on the very first day nov of the communist chinese invasion shocked and humiliated in what he allowed due mostly to his own arrogance to happened macarthur went on the offensive not against the advancing communist chinese and noth koreans forces but his own commander and chief pres harry s truman ed flanders in him not having the spin or guts to do what has to be done launch a full scale invasion of communist china with nuclear weapons if necessary to prevent its troops from overrunning the korean peninsula for pres truman who had taken just about enough garbage from gen macarthur in him running off his mouth in public in how he was mishandling the war in not going all out like macarthur wanted him to against the red chinese this was the last straw on april pres truman unceremoniously relived gen macarthur from his command as supreme commander of the us un forces in korea pres truman s brave but very unpopular decision also by not going along with macarthur s total war strategy prevented a third world war from breaking out with the soviet union communist china s ally who at the time like the us had the atomic bomb pres truman s controversial decision to dump the very popular gen macarthur also cost him his re election in with his polls numbers so low in the mid s that he withdrew in march of that year from the us presidential campaign in was gen macarthur s misfortune to be around when the political and military climates in the world were changing in how to conduct future wars with the horrors of a nuclear war now in a reality it would have been national suicide to go all out like gen macarthur wanted to against the red chinese with it very possibly touching off a nuclear holocaust that would engulf not only the us ussr red china but the entire world it was that important reality of future war that gen macarthur was never taught since the a and h bomb weren t yet invented in west point back to we can now see that gen macarthur after finishing his commencement speech at west point had become both an older and wiser soldier as well as since his retirement from the us military elder statesman in his feeling about war and the utter futility of it one thing that gen macarthur was taught at an early age from his civil war general dad douglas macarthur sr that stuck to him all his life was that to a soldier like himself war should be the very last not first resort in settling issues between nations in that it s the soldiers who have to fight and die in it it took a lifetime with the advent of the nuclear age for gen macarthur to finally realize just how right and wise his dad a congressional medal of honor winner like himself really was
another small piece of the vast picture puzzle of the holocaust is turned face up in this docudrama about the rosenstrasse protest in berlin an event i had not known of that began in late february the details are given in an addendum that follows this review the film narrative sets the story of this protest within another contemporary story that begins in new york city in the present here a well off non observant jewish woman whose husband has just died shocks her children and others by insisting on an extremely orthodox mourning ritual she goes even further demanding that her daughter s non jewish fianc leave the house the distressed daughter hannah maria schrader then learns for the first time from an older cousin that during wwii in berlin her mother then years old had been taken in and protected by an aryan woman hannah drops everything goes to berlin and finds this woman lena fischer now hannah easily persuades the woman to tell her story it all seems rather too pat the film thereafter improves focusing through long flashbacks primarily on the events of that surrounded the protest in which the fictitious central character is the same mrs fischer at played magnificently by katja riemann a baroness and accomplished pianist who is married to fabian martin feifel a jewish concert violinist one of the men detained at the rosenstrasse site the narrative does briefly weave back to the present from time to time and also ends in new york city once again while scenes in the present are color saturated the scenes are washed out strong on blue gray tones the quality of acting is generally quite good what we might expect given the deep reservoir of talent in germany and the direction of margarethe von trotta new german cinema s most prominent female filmmaker herself a former actress the story of the protest is told simply only one feature is lacking that would have helped still text notes at the end indicating the eventual outcome for those people taken into custody at rosenstrasse an outcome that was as the addendum below makes clear incredibly positive rosenstrasse has not fared well in the opinions of most film critics overly long needlessly layered purveyor of gender stereotypes manipulative with music so go the usual raps it is too long but i found in this film an austere powerful spontaneous and entirely convincing voice of protest from the women who kept the vigil outside the place on rosenstrasse where their jewish relatives and others were detained i found nothing flashy contemporary or manipulative in this depiction the very absence of extreme violence no one is shot or otherwise physically brutalized intensified my tension which increased incrementally as the film progressed you keep waiting for some vicious attack to begin any minute the somberness of the film stayed with me afterward i awoke often later in the night i saw the film my mind filled with bleak melancholic chaotic images and feelings conjured by the film for me that happens rarely in german and english my rating b seen on if you d like to read more of my reviews send me a message for directions to my websites add the rosenstrasse protest swept up from their forced labor jobs in what was meant to be the final roundup in the national capital to jews mostly men married to non jewish women were herded into rosenstrasse a welfare office for the jewish community in central berlin because these jews had german relatives many of them highly connected adolf eichmann hoped that segregating them from other prisoners would convince family members that their loved ones were being sent to labor camps rather than to more ominous destinations in occupied poland normally those arrested remained in custody for only two days before being loaded onto trains bound for the east but before deportation of prisoners could occur in this case wives and other relatives got wind of what was happening and appeared at the rosenstrasse address first in ones and twos and then in ever growing numbers perhaps as many as six thousand participated in the protest although not all at the same time women demanded back their husbands day after day for a week unarmed unorganized and leaderless they faced down the most brutal forces at the disposal of the third reich joseph goebbels the gauleiter governor or district leader of berlin anxious to have that city racially cleansed was also in charge of the nation s public morale on both counts he was worried about the possible repercussions of the women s actions rather than inviting more open dissent by shooting the women down in the streets and fearful of jeopardizing the secrecy of the final solution goebbels with hitler s concurrence released the rosenstrasse prisoners and even ordered the return of twenty five of them who already had been sent to auschwitz to both hitler and goebbels the decision was a mere postponement of the inevitable but they were mistaken almost all of those released from rosenstrasse survived the war the women won an astonishing victory over the forces of destruction adapted from an article posted at the university of south florida website a teacher s guide to the holocaust
most people miss hollywood s point of concept if a hero can stimulate heroic deeds to the mind of a child within the confines of the law then i approve of the lessons being taught by doc savage in all times of conflict or war the public and government look for heroes to decorate the motion picture industry brings heroes to the screen for people to identify with such as doc savage james bond superman batman spiderman and others doc savage is remembered by more than one generation as being the best of the best before james bond superman or any of the others all others that follow doc savage are only a part of the character not the man of bronze
this anime seriously rocked my socks when the anime first opened itself i felt it was too slow the story wasn t quite moving forward and shirou was quite an unimpressive male lead once he learns more about tracing and you learn more about saber and the holy grail war itself the story pans out and you can see multiple facets of it moving together it was fantastic additionally i felt that the way the characters developed was very true to form with the way real people develop in the real world there wasn t any stupid completely obvious things going on the development of ilya and rin was interesting to watch but i think the way shirou and saber grew in their certain personalities was just interesting to watch all on its on a few of the surprise people that show up gilgamesh seemed to also be unique from the rest of the cast in one way or another meaning we didn t have generic bad ass a being replaced by generic bad ass b as soon as a died anddd i loved the music the opening music rocked and the finishing theme from the final episode just seriously pushed forward the theme of the last episode even more good job type moon
i watched this film sort of by accident having bought it as the b side on the omega man dvd the omega man was a bit of a disappointment except for the beginning which was clearly the inspiration for days later the rest of it is just the stuff of tv movies but soylent green is in a whole other league i bet this is one of tarantino s favourites there are at least scenes in the film that i ve never seen anything like before heston casually getting into bed with the furniture while discussing something else completely unrelated a whole crowd of people being scooped up by a fleet of mechanical diggers a priest taking confession and being shot by the confessor ok maybe that s been done since but there aren t many films that are so consistently original like this and what the heck is going on between heston and edward g robinson is this the most unlikely gay couple ever or what luckily i saw this film without knowing the ending which apparently is rare then i watched it again and enjoyed all the little clues that make the long early scenes worthwhile a very nice script and some great sets too just when you thought you d seen everything
this movie was just as good as some of the other westerns made by anthony mann and james stewart like winchester and the naked spur and much better than thunder bay and bend of the river this film starts out like a run of the mill western but gets more complex as it goes along it starts out with jimmy stewart and walter brennan arriving in seattle and stewart is charged with murder he is found innocent but is cattle is stolen by a corrupt judge stewart then agrees to lead something but i forget what it is but stewart only cares about getting his cattle back as the movie goes along it s like stewart only cares about himself just like his character in the naked spur it gets much better at the halfway point after they arrive in alaska this is one of stewart s better westerns
one of the more intelligent serial killer movies in recent history zodiac killer offers an imaginative take on the background and history of one of the most notorious serial killers the filmmakers create an unexpectedly good insight into the pathology of this mysterious killer and anyone who remembers zodiac will be intrigued others will want to discover more about this enigmatic criminal unlike many serial killers zodiac was not insane at all but very methodical and a self promoter the director here plays viewer expectations and pulls it off the film is constructed as a murder mystery or a cold case style thriller it is an intelligent investigative procedural style horror film that will put off gore hounds in search of cheap thrills some people dislike any movie that is shot on video this attitude is very old style and provincial it is an attitude and view of movies that puts technical issues above entertainment value or artistic value these attitudes are on the way out zodiac killer is a low budget film no doubt but discerning viewers will look beyond that and find a carefully crafted gem
great actors an oscar nominee actress stunning scenery good strong story line and more laughs than you can fit into my new handbag and thats quite big this film was brilliant it was beautifully acted in the more serious scenes and the funny moments were well side splitting i have never heard a cinema audience laugh so much and tears were streaming down my cheeks during the stoned ladies in the tea shop scene well done to the british film industry and to craig ferguson whose magic ingredients have made sure this is one of my favourite films of the year if not of all time
i remember watching this movie with my friends when we were years old but the weird thing is that i never watched it after that the other day i was babysitting and my cousin never saw all dogs go to heaven so we rented both movies and watched them together today and he really loved these movies so many memories came back watching this movie once again and i have to admit i even cried a little i m years old and the ending still gets to me all dogs go to heaven is one of the most touching animated films and i m shocked honestly by this rating of i thought this movie would bring back good memories for others as well i admit the animation was a bit typical but the story is just so charming and fun charlie is a gambling dog who gets killed by another gambling dog carface but when charlie wants revenge he comes back to earth with a watch that can t stop ticking or that s the end of his life again when he and his best friend itchy look for carface and spy on him they find out how carface gets all his money he has a little orphan girl who talks to animals and finds out who is going to win the races charlie takes the girl ann marie and makes fake promises in order to get the money but he ends up learning that maybe he should put ann marie first before himself when carface goes back to him with a vengeance all dogs go to heaven is the perfect family film it s not disney but this is an excellent family film to watch not to mention that it s just so cute and touching i know it s ridicules and some people call me crazy but this movie for me when i was a kid made me believe that dogs have souls how could they not they re just so loving and i think i m going to cry again but anyways i would just recommend this movie for anyone it s a fun movie to watch

i recently found this movie on vhs after looking for it for a number of years i was not disappointed it gets better every time i see it peter ustinov stars and co wrote the original screenplay nominated for an academy award other stars you ve heard of include karl malden bob newhart and cesar romero ustinov plays an accountant embezzler just released from england s infamous wormwood scrubs prison he had embezzled from the conservative party headquarters selected because he is a liberal he immediately begins a search for a new employer from whom he can embezzle and discovers that computers are the wave of the future he social engineers his way into a london men s club and learns the identity of the best computer experts in town he steals the identity of one caesar smith who has just left town for south america to pursue his hobby of collecting moths in the wild he talks his way into ta can co an american conglomerate headed by carlton klemper karl malden klemper hires smith and shows him around the computer center especially its security feature consisting of a flashing blue light ustinov asks the computer how to defeat its security and the computer obligingly tells him disconnect blue light using hacking techniques from years in the future ustinov breaks into the system and programs the computer to generate checks written to various bogus companies the scheme starts to unravel when klemper s assistant willard g gnatpole bob newhart notices the amount of business ta can co appears to be transacting with ustinov s scam companies with the help of his secretary patty terwilliger maggie smith ustinov manages to avoid prosecution and lives happily ever after to tell you how would spoil this very funny romantic intelligent and ahead of its time picture
this movie has problems in its presentation may even be offensive to people who are looking for temporal and cultural faithfulness but it challenges the watcher to reflect on a variety of issues one of these is the nature and character of the relationship between jesus and judas another is that of the historical nature of the bible and faith and third is the humanity of jesus the tension of the christ betrayer relationship is developed and held through the movie judas passion is presented as a darker parallel to that of christ when judas takes his own life the viewer can sense the angst peter s denial and guilt however moving are not as powerfully portrayed as the judas drama chris sarandon offers a novel and provocative christ whether believable or not i would like to find this movie on dvd or even vhs to use in study or discussion groups
this along with hare tonic ranks as one of the best bugs cartoons indeed one of the best bugs ever there are some comments about how bugs in these cartoons is basic meaning i guess that he is as yet not fully developed i actually prefer this basic version from the mid s chuck jones was the best version who is actually more rabbit sized and far more amusing than the eventual long legged version who towered over yosemite sam and daffy duck the latter day bugs came to be too suave and sophisticated for my liking also check out hair raising hare and rabbit punch for great examples of classic bugs and classic chuck jones
all i have to say is if you don t like it then there is something wrong with you plus jessica is just all kinds of hot the only reason you may not like it is because it is set in the future where seattle has gone to hell that and you my not like it cause the future they show could very well happen
i m a huge fan of the dukes of hazzard tv show and i really enjoyed this flick i enjoyed myself here a lot more than i did with other summer blockbusters it s funny hearing people rail against this movie with excuses like lame plot and it s much cruder than the show does anyone remember the crudeness of the humor in the pilot episode daisy makes incest jokes and bo says that luke had probably fathered half the kids in the orphanage the only reason it was cleaned up is because it changed to and earlier time slot and as far as the plot goes it was the perfect dukes plot in fact as a remake it probably stays truer to the source material than any tv show that has migrated to the big screen while sean william scott and johnny knoxville aren t exactly like their small screen versions they do a great job and work very well together i wasn t too keen on burt s boss hogg though and i would have like a little bit more incompetence from sheriff roscoe in the movie roscoe is a little scary and who didn t have a smile on their face as the general lee is racing through the streets of atlanta and the back roads of hazzard folks allow yourself to enjoy a movie that is just an excuse for nostalgia bikinis and car chases you won t be sorry it s just a great dumb movie
i saw this movie being a jane austen addicted and always feeling doubtful about cinematographic rendering of the complexity of her novels well this transposition is simply accurate intelligent delicate careful tactful respectful intense in a word perfect emma is one of austen s most delightful and funny novels thanks to overall irony pervading situations and characters the movie respected this subtle irony not disregarding the comic element miss bates above all what engaged me in the novel and the movie renders it clearly is the deep knowledge of human life shown by the english novelist and the modern look with which women men and their relation are handled and it is astounding if we think how a woman novelist of the th century who lived almost a secluded life could grasp such depth and truth about life as she did that most and still fascinates me we can feel this modernity throughout the movie just replace costumes and use a more current language but the situations the feelings the ideas would be extremely modern i think of the morbid interest in other people s lives or that insinuating envy which now as ever rule women s relations and still the difficulty in revealing and giving expression to one s feelings especially love every situation gets a universal and out of time value the cast is really talented and offer very good and extremely brilliant performances a young gwyneth paltrow is particularly suitable for this role nowadays she would be probably too mature for it toni colette is simply great and how i envied them for the wonderful dresses they could wear and then the breathtaking english countryside where every situation gets such a magic and dream like dimension a really enjoyable and deserving movie
i ve been watching dick tracy for years and as a result it s become a vital part of my life it was with me throughout childhood and i used to see it quite often seeing it now as an adult it s still a very good movie dark satiric and incredibly misunderstood about the only thing that can be said is the oscar nomination pacino received other than that it is rarely discussed and didn t make much of a fuss when it came out pacino is over the top but to good effect as he s clearly having loads of fun beatty is great as dick tracy and behind the camera manages to capture the atmosphere of a film noir comic book better than any other film possibly i have ever seen just taking a look at one scene from the film is breathtaking the lighting velvet overtones and smog smoke combine to create a great effect there are some really funny cameos including one by dustin hoffman as mumbles and i don t think there are any flaws at all in terms of acting even the mandatory kid character is far better than expected overall a really fine movie that has become misunderstood over the years since its release and is incredibly underrated with only average on imdb the critics reviews are very positive check out rottentomatoes com and after seeing the film once again it s not hard to see why this is a perfect example of capturing the essence of a comic book from style to eccentricity highly recommended stars
these two men went thru hell and beyond and have produced the movie that conveys the terror that many did not survive this is definitely a movie about survival but not without it s touching moments the finest piece of work i have seen documenting the tragedy of new york city
delightful disney film with angela lansbury in fine form as a middle age spinster whose interest turns to witchcraft in world war england lansbury was about age at the time of the film and she is just ideal for the part she is jessica fletcher again but this time it s for the benefit or children and for mother england during a time of great peril the film follows the adventures of miss price lansbury and david tomlinson as the professor of witchcraft in trying to obtain certain information on sorcery those little darlings sent to live with price to escape the london bombings are just wonderful in this enchanting film for all of us regardless of age too bad that tessie o shea roddy mcdowall and sam jaffe are given so little to do in this endearing film i really thought of the ben stiller film night at the museum at the end of the film when the relics come to life to do battle with the nazi invasion in the small british coastal town
the man in the moon is a warm and moving coming of age drama centering around a farming family in the s the main story follows a year old girl reese witherspoon who develops a crush on a year old neighbor jason london who ends up falling for her older sister emily warfield and how an unexpected tragedy alters this family s dynamics forever the s are lovingly evoked here and the screenplay gives you characters you come to care about almost immediately witherspoon already begins to show the oscar winning talent she would develop in this early role and london makes a charming leading man warfield lends a quiet maturity to the role of the older sister that is effective as well kudos to sam waterston and tess harper who play the girls parents and gail strickland who plays london s mom i was unexpectedly moved by this quiet and affecting drama that stirs up strong emotions and gives deeper meaning to the phrase family ties
why am i so convinced there s actually another film version of this novel out there somewhere i saw the film again this year as i am teaching the novel and find the changes in the film annoying there is no appearance of the little boy in the novel and the ending has been changed they kill him off in the film but the whole point is that he is haunted by the events at eel marsh house for many years but does remarry and eventually put the events behind him mr bentley is a far more sympathetic character in the novel the scene in the film where kipps sets fire to the office is plain daft and the constant appearance of the toy soldier to signify the presence of the child is genuinely creepy but pointless kipps is haunted by the woman seeking revenge not the child i am sure i ve seen a film which is better and closer to the novel and actually scarier have i just imagined this
walt disney his old men put their own spin on the classic fairy tale of cinderella which i guess you could say helps form an unofficial fairy tale princess trilogy from the classic disney years the plot cinderella is a nice girl who can t catch a break she is the daughter of a nice wealthy widower who loved her dearly but her mother passed away when cinderella was very young and cindy s father felt she needed a mother figure so he eventually married the woman who would become known as lady tremaine herself a widow with two daughters about the same age as cinderella anastasia and drizella at first they all seemed to get along but then cinderella s father died and lady tremaine s true nature was revealed she was a cold cruel callous heartless mean spirited woman and she passed those traits on to her daughters who were spoiled bratty and equally mean spirited anastasia drizella hate cinderella because they know deep down that she s better looking and an overall nicer more attractive lady than themselves i e more appealing to men and their mother lady tremaine hates cindy for pretty much the same reasons as the years passed lady tremaine began to squander the family fortunes in a stubborn but futile quest to improve refine her awkward unattractive daughters to call them homely would be an insult to homely people everywhere while all three relegated cinderella to being the multi tasking servant of the house abusing her mistreating her and humiliating her every chance they get they are particularly fond of increasing her already absurd workload that brings us to cinderella in the present where she has blossomed into a good looking young lady who somehow manages to remain kind hearted and nice despite her abusive step family and holds on to the hope that one day the tables will turn in her favor cinderella gets her shot at freedom happiness when a royal ball is held to introduce the local prince to an eligible young maiden so that he can take her as a wife settle down start a family etc naturally her step family tries to keep her from attending even going so far as to physically assault her and rip up the dress she had procured for herself with a little help from her mice friends the dress belonged to her biological mother finally pushed beyond her breaking point cinderella runs out into the courtyard and cries in despair it is at that point that her fairy godmother a short plump jolly woman arrives and provides cinderella with transportation and a transformed dress after all cinderella wouldn t make a very good impression at the ball if she entered the scene looking like she had just gotten gang raped cindy arrives at the ball the prince falls hard for her but that pesky midnight rule gets in the way forcing her to flee but leaving behind a glass slipper make a long story short after a long harrowing quest to find the mystery girl via trying on the glass slipper cinderella is found and she and the prince get married giving her the happy ending she deserves overall an enjoyable disney classic not without its flaws the most glaring of which is that the prince is little more than a macguffin to help push the plot along he has very little screen time and even less dialogue so we never get to know him very well or get a good look at his relationship with cinderella which is unfortunate since according to the making of documentary the prince was originally meant to play a bigger role and a few additional scenes to help flesh out cinderella herself might have been helpful there was a song that showed her fantasizing of turning into an army of maids to clean up the house as well as eavesdropping on her step family post ball to show her amusement at their jealousy which was cut because walt himself thought it made her look spiteful still cinderella herself is a likable enough heroine even if she is upstaged by her mice friends and there s a sweetness to the film that is becoming harder to find these days of course if this were being made now cinderella would probably put up more of a struggle against her family during the dress ripping scene and would probably free herself in the climax either by picking the lock herself or making an impractical yet exciting jump down from her window but this is beside the point and for all those who say cinderella sets a bad example for young girls well consider this at least cinderella didn t go around getting publicly drunk and indecently exposed unlike some modern day princesses you know who i mean
this movie is great the music with the exception of the very first song in the movie was awesome the story line is awesome too it s just basically a wonderfull movie for all ages i found the last battle scene awesome basically this was a great flick

excellent farce which of course is all it is intended to be thankfully there is neither a social or political message nor is there the slightest attempt in that direction could the plot actually take or have taken place in any particular time or location unlikely for after all this is simply merely a movie and movies spring from imagination not from reality the only goal of this movie is to entertain certainly not to educate and entertain it does with reality delightfully and lightheartedly tossed to the winds i think most would agree that from documentaries we expect enlightenment and authenticity but for entertainment i want what is nowadays described as a no brainer which the mating game is in all respects for a few chuckles and an outright laugh now and then this is fine fare fantasy
i watched this flick yesterday and i have to say it s the finest horror film made for i ve ever seen sorry steckler the film is definitely worth seeking out if you are a zombie fan this movie reeks of soul and atmosphere some of the shots of the zombs are the best ever committed to film very creepy looking dusty webbed corpses slowly shamble to their screaming victims brrrrrrr hot saggy canadian women with sexy accents will keep you preoccupied before the horror rears its undead corpse eating head this film entertained from start to finish i couldn t ask for more than that my only complaint is that is was too short
while the original version with preston foster was good there s no remake more worthy than this one or more impossible to find anywhere just as i strongly suspect mickey rooney to have had something to do with that never could a mere performance have ever been so masterfully brilliant or a script more thought provoking as well as an improvement upon the original many years after the last of my several viewings of this film in i read an article in which mickey rooney was recounting a visit he d made to death row and which had apparently very drastically eliminated whatever sense of personal identification he d felt with people in similar circumstances the article was about as short as the main character here and didn t cover much other than the extent to which his extreme disillusionment with the quality of the inmates themselves had been emphasized even in language i would not care to explicitly quote here one of my main problems with capital punishment is that of course it is not evenly impartially applied just as many innocent people are far too carelessly thus unnecessarily sent to meet this particular fate another problem i have with it is that it is not applied swiftly enough or for that matter even publicly enough the bible makes a special point in such cases about one of the more important purposes of such as a deterrent being ineffectually obscured minus not only a public viewing but also the direct participation of all as for those who claim to prove statistically that such is not an effective deterrent in addition to having a problem about the reliability of their data i have little if any objectively disprovable doubt many are behind bars now due to the extent that such a deterrent is lacking however i do have a problem about the fact that robert duvall in the apostle had been punished at all for his particular crime or that the only hope of leniency for one such as he would have to be based on a temporary insanity defense as though that would serve as the only acceptable excuse in his kind of case in addition to various other questions concerning the motives of mickey rooney for that particular visit he d recounted and about the answers to which i can only try to speculate i suspect the main one had been of a decidedly religious nature i don t know exactly when he d become the professing christian he now makes it a special point whenever possible to emphasize that he is but as anybody should be well aware this particular category of people tends to be the most vehemently out for blood when it comes to extracting an eye for an eye however i have no particular bone of contention concerning that per se just as there s no doubt scripturally speaking that not all and perhaps not even most shall be spared the same ultimate fate at the hands of the lord himself as a result of his sacrifice on the cross however there is a problem for me about the spirit or attitude with which most professing christians emphasize their enthusiasm for capital punishment for contrary to the lord himself who would love to see everybody saved ezekiel ii peter they seem to go vindictively out of their way to find reasons to condemn what most people on either side of this superlatively ever burning issue cannot appear to sufficiently appreciate is that the lord is as dynamically and elusively soft in nature as he is hard the two sides of his nature appear to be so inherently incompatible as to render him mentally deranged at least by any strictly human reckoning yet regardless of how harrowingly ungraspable this miraculously dynamic blending of the water and oil in his nature surely is there can be no doubt that anything short of it or anything fanatically and characteristically on either one side or the other of this equation falls inadequately and unacceptably short of the entire judicial truth indeed i ve seen the most blood curdling thirst for the same come out self contradictorily enough on far too many occasions whenever the categorically anti death penalty advocates are confronted even in the most rationally well balanced ways with the fact that although the lord died for everybody not all are thereby going to be saved after all in order to receive absolution one must to repeat the same term reach out and receive it that is repent luke could anything make more sense but then what about the lord s command to forgive even in the case of one s enemies of those who despise and persecute you without a just cause or provocation one of the far too prevailing difficulties with this kind of sentimentality as popularly misinterpreted is the way it obscuringly over simplifies the real meaning of forgiveness the act of forgiveness does not in itself mean the same thing as unconditionally excusing the one being forgiven when one takes a clearly sober rationally well balanced view here from the perspective of god s own attitude all it actually amounts to is a fervent wish that the one forgiven will ultimately succeed at finding his way seeing the light and being granted mercy this attitude is of course the very opposite of say that of jonah who actually resented it when god told him that his preaching to the people of nineveh would result in their repentance jonah didn t want them to repent but vindictively desired that they be destroyed how self righteously cold bloodedly like unto most professing christians he was save that even his reasons were undoubtedly better than most i envy jonah almost as much as he would me however minus the repentance of the one being forgiven any forgiveness he may receive from a genuine christian is not going to do him any good in such a case the only one to benefit is the real christian himself
i don t think i could have enjoyed it more though certain things were disturbing i m not going to say what if you haven t seen it you ll have to find out for yourself at any rate what movie can lack with robert downey jr s puppy dog eyes all in all the plot was developed sufficiently nothing seemed too rushed as movies like this tend to be the characters were like able and there were plenty of hilarious scenes in it the idea over all is that the story is very well tied together even if certain aspects may be unsatisfactory by matter of opinion but like i said before it s hard not to love any movie with robert downey jr
though i like e e doc smith s books and david a kyles books of lensman the anime which is loosly based on the books is quite a fun and somewhat innovative fair though the story may seem familiar to sci fi fantasy buffs such as some kid on an isolated planet inherits mystical powers and avenges the death of his family it is quite an entertaining one nonetheless plus lensman was the first animated motion picture to use hand drawn and cg animation all at once sure it may look a bit outdated now but it is still an innovation if it were not for lensman none of that would have ever happened personally i think computer graphics look better in animation that live action too bad they only released it on dvd vcd in a few countries in the worls mostly on formats that are quite foreign and different i just wish they release the lensman movie and tv series on dvd vcd in every part of the world not just certain parts p s worsel rules i just think he is so amazing and neat looking as well
having previously seen the abridged print presented by david shepard i finally got a hold of a complete or nearer complete version which was about minutes compared to the minute version more widely distributed the shepard print for image entertainment is certainly of superior quality and the best parts are there but it s nonetheless good to see the rest of the film and fill in some loose story ends in the shepard print the film ends with mary stating you see i ve changed my mind i m never going home yet in the complete version mary and kenneth driscoll end their relationship soon after that scene mary returns home to the country and driscoll rekindles his relationship with vivian this additional footage develops the character vivian who had little relevance in the shepard version moreover in the complete version the film begins in the new jersey countryside with mary where she reads and fantasizes about her ideal lover she s disappointed by the reality of the advances by farm chore boy johnny applebloom a character completely absent from the shepard version but after her affair with driscoll she returns to the country to presumably and eventually become a farmer s wife regardless of the print a girl s folly is a good little film for made by one of the top directors of the s maurice tourneur in it tourneur takes plenty of jabs at his own business including by playing a caricature of himself the director of the film within the film the two leads also give quality performances by early screen acting standards robert warwick an actor playing a skirt chasing star and doris kenyon as an ing nue aspiring to play an ing nue on the screen self referential films which made film making the focus of the films were nothing new by now mack sennett had already parodied this type of film three years prior with mabel s dramatic career several aspects of this one stand out though frances marion s intertitles are humorous including illustrations of the actors on a chessboard with a hand directing them remarkable for i especially liked the film s final title cards where two observers remark on the film s happy ending gee but ain t that romantick and the other replies romance nuthin that s movin pictures fellow female screenwriter anita loos made a similar self referential conclusion to another film from wild and woolly both writers helped change the role of their professions in the business and art some of the photography by tourneur and john van den broek is good especially concerning the film making business the use of mirrors in several scenes is a nice reinforcement of the film s self reflexivity furthermore the editing is exceptional the quick crosscutting during the studio scenes is especially salient it serves to punctuate the hectic pace filmmakers work at especially back then
difficult film to comment on how do you say it s bad well it isn t but then it s equally difficult to say it is good what it is is compelling viewing it is as close as you will get to utter devastation without being there it is the photographs of the tsunami approaching the coast of thailand brought to life you know you want to turn away but you have to watch the naudet brothers handle the commentary very well even in the most tragic of circumstances there view on something which is happening in another country neither panders nor insults the facts are on the cellulose and little is needed for the viewer to understand or comprehend what is going on you can t change history and you should not want this film stands as a testament to humanity in its darkest hour
am i the only one who saw the connection between the discussion of camus the myth of sisyphus and mary s life in camus version a man is condemned to spend his eternity with a giant boulder that he must roll up a hill unfortunately every time he reaches the top the boulder slips and ends up back at the bottom for him to start there may have been a buzzard pecking at his eyes i m not sure right now in the movie mary spends her life struggling to get her life together unfortunately every time she gains any footing she falls and loses everything case in point would be the party she throws where she gets intoxicated offends her falafel lover and is practically attacked by liev schrieber in case you question this theory note how this scene ends with her attempting to climb a flight of stars while books fall from nowhere impeding her progress until ultimately she passes out the next morning when she awakens she is still on the stairs never having reached the top
love hurts that i think is the main message mike binder s newest film reign over me brings across whether that love has caused your relationship to become stagnant or has brought anger from the one you love cheating for years or has broken your heart to the point of being unable to open yourself up to the world love hurts the great thing about this film however is not in its portrayal of these lost souls trying to let their past heartbreaks go but in the eventual restart of new bonds for the future no one in this drama is perfect they are all at some degree trapped emotionally in relationships that they can t free themselves from alone there is some heavy subject material here and i credit binder for never making the story turn into a political diatribe but instead infusing the serious moments with some real nice comedic bits allowing the tale to stay character based and small in scale compared to the epic event that looms overhead what could have become a trite vehicle for opinions on how effected us all ends up being a story about two men and a connection they share that is the only thing which can save their lives from a life of depression and regret this is a new career performance for adam sandler i like to think that my favorite director paul thomas anderson was the first to see the childish pent up anger in his stupid comedies as something to use dramatically the juvenility of a character like billy madison allows for laughs and potty humor but also can be used to show a repressed man shy and shutout to the world around him a man with no confidence that needs an event of compassion to break him from his shell anderson let sandler do just that in his masterpiece punch drunk love and mike binder has taken it one step further sandler plays former dentist charlie fineman whose wife and three kids were killed in one of the planes that took down the world trade center on that one moment crushed any life that he had and as a result he became reclusive and started to believe he couldn t remember anything that happened before that day he really delivers a moving portrait of a man trying to keep up the charade in his head while those around him those that love him try and open him up to the reality of what happened and what the future holds always on edge and ready to snap at any moment when something is mentioned to spark the memory of his perished family he goes through life with his ipod and headphones shutting out everything so as not to be tempted remember reign over me is not about charlie fineman though it is about dentist and family man alan johnson a man that has trapped himself into a marriage and dental practice that both have stagnated into monotony johnson needs as much help in his life as his old college roommate charlie does played perfectly by the always brilliant don cheadle johnson has lost his backbone to try and change his life he has no friends and when he sees charlie by chance one day his life evolves into something he hasn t felt in years he revels in the chance to go out with an old friend no matter how much he has changed from the death of his family cheadle s character wants to revert back to the college days of hanging out and sandler s doesn t mind because all that was before he met his wife the two men get what they want and allow themselves to grow close despite the years of solitude that used to rule their lives once they begin opening up though it is inevitable that the subject of the tragedy will creep up and test the fa ade they have created for themselves the supporting cast does an amazing job helping keep up appearances for the two leads jada pinkett smith has never been an actress that impressed me and throughout the film played the tough as nails wife nicely but it is her final scene on the phone with cheadle that really showed me something different and true liv tyler is a bit out of her element as a psychiatrist but the movie calls her on this fact and makes the miscasting perfect casting the many small cameos are also effective even writer director mike binder s role as sandler s old best friend and accountant my only gripe here is why he feels the need to put his name in the opening credits as an actor when it is everywhere considering it is his film last but not least is the beautiful saffron burrows she is a great actress and plays the love crushed divorc e trying to put her life back together wonderfully a role that seems comic relief at first but ends up being an integral aspect for what is to come binder has crafted one of the best dramatic character studies i have seen in a long time the direction is almost flawless the blurring between cuts and characters in the fore background really annoyed me in the beginning the acting superb and the story true to itself never taking the easy way out or wrapping itself up with a neatly tied bow at the conclusion even the music was fantastic and used to enhance not to lead us emotionally why after two great uses of the titular song by the who did binder feel the need to use the inferior eddie veddar remake for the end i don t know but it did unfortunately stick out for me reign over me is a film about love and how although it can cause the worst pain imaginable it can also save us from regret and allow us to once again see the world as a place of beauty and hope
undying is a very good game which brings some new elements on the tired genre of first person shoot em ups it tells the story of patrick galloway an expert of the occult and a formidable fighter who is summoned by a friend to his estate in ireland to investigate some weird phainomena the game is set in ireland after world war one so don t expect to find weapons like chainguns or rocket launchers all the weapons in the game can be considered antiques but the real fun in the game are its spells and the system they operate on our hero is ambidexterous so he can use both his hands at the same time he casts spells with his right arm and uses his guns with the left so you can shoot and cast spells at the same time which as you understand very fun and also unique to this game the graphics are great and they can run very well on a medium power p c level design is also cool and atmospheric mostly the game revolves around the covenant estate and the mansion but there are many other locations waiting to be discovered as you progress thanks to the talent of clyve barker the game has an excelent storyline and plot something very rare for a first person shooter and i said before a great and very spooky atmosphere the voice acting is also good but not excellent but the game has two main flaws first of all it is quite linear so when your mission says for example go to that room all the doors in the house will be locked apart from those that lead to the room of your mission this may save time but it restricts your liberty of exploration secondly the fact all the weapons are antiques may not appeal to most fps players who are used to high tech weaponry as far as difficulty is concerned the game is very well balanced most of it is of medium difficulty but sometimes it gets more difficult but not frustratingly difficult overall undying is a great game definitely one of the best fps out there
this is a comedy of morals so occasionally a gentle touch of bitterness occurs but a lightness soften all sarcasm and irony flows till all of a sudden one moment will halt your heart and changes everything this film marvelously written and directed is a gem that shines perfectly with beautiful acting by all jean louis trintignant is exquisite as usual and romy schneider is a pearl perfect and glowing that is not to be missed a truly wonderful film
i remember following the case of andre chicatillo in the newspapers while i was living in south africa they had photos of him sitting in his cage while being prosecuted in court not as it turned out to protect the court members but to protect him from the public this was fascinating albeit morbid reading i later heard that a film had been made by hbo about the case but it was made for american tv bummed strangely citizen x got a limited cinematic release in south africa i charged down to the local ster kinekor complex and duly bought a ticket i was alone my girlfriend at the time was only interested in the likes of steel magnolias and fried green tomatoes wow what a brilliant film why wasn t it released to a wider audience had it not been made for tv it could have got an oscar nomination or there is no way to spoil the ending who the killer is is never kept from the audience jeffrey demunn portrays a truly terrifying psycho he is calm downtrodden considered a failure by his wife and subjected to constant ridicule and humiliation by his superiors at work by committing these horrendous acts he gets to feel strong powerful fighting to catch him against all odds is a pathologist played to excellent turn by stephen rea in one of his strongest performances he must battle the snail pace of russian bureaucracy the primitive resources he has at his disposal and above all the refusal by his superiors to acknowledge that the ussr even has a serial killer the general in charge joss ackland says that serial killers are a decadent western phenomenon only donald sutherland is willing to help but his help must be under the counter the ever brilliant max von sydow plays a russian psychiatrist who breaks protocol and decides to help the investigators in their quest it is the first time in russian history that a shrink is used to build a profile of a serial killer still on the loose and he has everything to lose if his involvement is made public citizen x is brilliantly acted well written and the music and editing only add to the tension and theme of the film excellent support from a horribly underused imelda staunton and a real sense of impending doom make citizen x a film worth seeing this was too good to be made for tv
well when watching this film late one night i was simple amazed by it s greatness fantastic script great acting costumes and special effects and the plot twists wow in fact if you can see the ending coming you should become a writer yourself great i would recommend this film to anyone especially if i don t like them much terrific
i saw this movie when i was a little girl and i have enjoyed it every time sure the graphics are a little cheesy compared to now but back in the s it was great i saw it in the original spanish version only and thought it was wonderful that was how i remember my christmases were with my family magical santa claus was amazing and i couldn t wait for him to come back each year if you have a child children and speak spanish bring them up watching this old fashioned version of santa claus it s a different version than we are used to today but who says there is one way it s a fun movie to watch it teaches children good vs bad i don t know how the english subtitled version is or if there is an english one of this but the spanish is the best enjoy and happy holidays feliz navidad
a slight charming little movie to be sure but a superbly crafted one gwyneth paltrow shines in this early showcase for her british accent and the cast assembled around her all lap up the dialogue this came out around the time of sense and sensibility and i m sure i don t know why that one garnered all the oscar attention emma is jane austen s most accessible and least stuffy story told well
i saw this film when i was a young child on television thank you canadian broadcasting corporation and had nightmares about it for years afterwards trnka was one of the mentors for bratislav pojar one of canada s national film board s best animators pojar was in turn a mentor and collaborator for the great drouin if you like trnka you should see night angel the symbolism is obvious but deftly used the oppositions of beauty and life the plant are placed in opposition with the anonymity of the gloved hand the poor puppet hero is condemned despite a lack of political agenda what i most remembered was the feeling of oppression in the decor the small room where the action takes place is the character s entire world the invasion by the hand is a complete violation of that world beautiful and haunting film i found a copy of this and other wonderful shorts by trnka at the public library and showed it to my own kids a must see
if you re one of those who recognise with pleasure such arcane titles as book of the dead book of eibon or necronomicon then you should feel right at home with malefique a film which also features an occult tome one with the power to change the destinies of all involved discovered by four french prisoners sharing a cell the fearsome object has been placed in the wall there by danvers a serial killer incarcerated back in the s a man obsessed with rejuvenation and the black arts before he abruptly vanished finders of the book are carr re g rald laroche a company embezzler shopped by his wife lassalle philippe laudenbach who aspires to be a woman but at the same time body builds to execute an escape plan the halfwit p querette dimitri rataud who once ate his baby sister and the librarian marcus clovis cornillac supposedly driven mad by reading who murdered his wife reminding the viewer of meat loaf s equally bizarre bosomy male in fight club lassalle begins as the dominant member of the quartet one who is especially protective of the infantile p querette with the coming of the book however and the overarching need to decipher its dangerous contents marcus assumes greater and greater significance at first assured of an early bail meanwhile carr re takes little more than academic interest in events suddenly he too needs an urgent escape option and as the prisoners experiment danvers book starts to reveal some of its terrifying powers staged for the most part within a prison cell and between four or five characters malefique has a claustrophobic air entirely suited to its subject matter as well as the limited budget of the filmmakers only at the start and then at the conclusion do we get to leave the confines of the cell a necessary opening out which only serves to emphasise the doomed closed in nature of proceedings elsewhere more than anything this is a film about being trapped either as a victim of your criminal past or of occult events now unfolding i m going to escape says carr re at the start of the film wishing more than anything to be able to rejoin his wife and son whether or not he does it will be at a terrible price and the great irony of the film is that the ultimate form of an escape may not be one a man might imagine with all its budget limitations it is greatly to the first time feature director eric vallette s credit that his film succeeds as well as it does as critics have noticed it is a film with strong freudian overtones lassalle s distinctive mammaries and adult breast feeding for instance the picture of a vagina which comes to life and develops an eye the grown man who dissolves back into a foetus danvers original placenta fetish the dark cell as a primitive womb from which delivery is awaited etc with so many interesting aspects to the script vallette hardly puts a foot wrong and he succeeds in creating a genuinely unsettling atmosphere out of what when one comes down to it is just a matter of four guys four bunks one folding table and a book there s a genuine growing lovecraftian frisson as the men summon up the unnameable darkness from within its pages while one or two moments the aforementioned blinking vagina or what ultimately happens to p querette are unsettlingly memorable the pacing of many of the dark events in malefique is deliberate rejecting the rapid cutting of many hollywood productions a video culture approach that often subverts the horrified gaze in favour of quick fix action and gore perhaps this is a particularly european manner as one recalls a similar measured approach to shocking hallucination taken in such films as verhoeven s the fourth man a film that incidentally also shares a particularly nasty image based around a prolapsed eye lensed well in malefique benefits from excellent performances and if for this viewer at least the conclusion was not as explainable as it might have been the journey to the final shot was worth taking coming so soon after the release of the similarly well received haute tension aka switchblade romance this is another reason to be grateful that good horror films are once again emerging from the french industry this after a time when it seemed the only worthwhile product came from asia
pecker is a hilariously funny yet twisted film about a small town in baltimore whose daily humdrum routine is broken by pecker a young photographer who takes pictures of real things no pretty models no gorgeous men just hard living this wonderful film pokes fun at the plasticness of the urban art chain there is one particular scene when a homeless woman who shops at pecker s mom s thrift shop buys the same exact coat as one of the whitney art junkies for only cents instead of five hundred dollars this just goes to show you that no matter what kind of money you have you might not always have taste yet again john waters sends you into a never ending spiral of laughter and raw reality you can have your mainstream hollywood movies with special affects and mountains of celebrities but give me a pecker or a hairspray another excellent john waters film over a titanic or a godzilla anyday
this movie is witty watchable and utterly touching and now often do you get to see jean harlow or any actress of this era for that matter give another woman a swift punch in the jaw twice after harlow s ruby is sent to a reformatory after getting mixed up with gable s edward hall he of that cheesy yet endearing crooked smile her predicament becomes all the more complicated when she discovers that she is pregnant and she s convinced that this rake has abandoned her but in fact her love has reformed him and he comes to see her despite the fact that he will be arrested and from the help of a minister are married the wonderful relationship that harlow shares with her fellow inmates is second only to her electric chemistry with gable who was her most frequent leading man her cynical character is a perfect match for gable s smooth talking crook what s not to like you know you wouldn t be a bad looking dame if it wasn t for your face ruby cuttingly remarks to gypsy her rival if you re going to get that close to me i ll have to open the other window priceless

this movie describes the life of somebody who grew up in the worst of circumstances but unlike many people he actually grew up to be a respectable person whats more is that this is a true story antwone fisher is so innocent and yet he was abused such just because he was not white antwone fisher has been married to the same women for ten years and he never fooled around with women coke cigars weed alcohol or any of those things that are very popular in the places he was growing up there is not much more to say about this movie it is excellent the only rating i can give it is a
i read schneebaum s book same title as this film when it was first published and was deeply moved by his ability to see through the many ways of otherness his own and the people of the amazon with whom he lived and loved to a way of living a decent life his subsequent books were not as powerful but showed his continuing quest his description of his sexual relations with the men of the tribe was way ahead of its time in the early s but his honesty and openness about it were welcome this movie beautifully conveys both the quirkiness and generosity of the man but also provides a glimpse into the inevitable destruction of innocence which is not a morally positive term in this case that occurs when civilized men intrude on traditional societies even so schneebaum himself has moved into a kind of higher innocence that suggests the possibility of saving humanity from its own destructiveness
who votes in these ratings jacknife is a beautifully acted brilliantly observed piece of work with actors on top of their game especially ed harris and the peerless robert deniro please don t mention marlon brando in the same breath of this man see taxi driver for confirmation of this point is it a mundane movie because it doesn t have sex meaningless action nudity in it this movie is about the complexities of the characters involved ed harris makes you feel every moment with him and his emotional outburst towards the end is heartbreaking the part where he orders a young man in a bar to take off his army clothes is a wonderful observation of how fashion and the movies exploit tragic situations and how frustrated real men must feel to see a young upstart sporting military attire while we are on this subject casino out of one of the greatest films of all time from one of the greatest directors starring the greatest movie actor of all time with the scariest film psychotic gangster ever only warrants just above average come on
this is definatley one of the best stand up shows evre ever eddie is so off the wall that i ve been watching this damn show for nearly five years now and it still rocks every single time just everything from his big broad physical comedy down to the little off the top of the head side remarks it s a masterpeice you need look no further than this line the word herb you say erb and we say herb cuz ther s a f ing h in it brilliant
if there were two more charming performers than peter ustinov and maggie smith appearing together in a more charming movie in i don t know who they were i first saw this delightful little satiric gem years ago at the age of and i consider any year in which i have failed to sit down to watch it again a wasted one it s intelligent quirky neat wistful sweet gently subversive and utterly enchanting the romance of these two social misfits is both richly comic and terribly moving never more so than in maggie smith s desperate attempt to bring up the right card in the deck a scene that s both ruefully funny and a perfect thumbnail portrait of heartbreaking loneliness and that final freeze frame on the anxious concerned loving face of ustinov as he asks are you all right has anyone ever made the look and sound of devotion so perfectly and nakedly honest i would never want to know anyone well who didn t love this movie
legend of dragoon is one of those little known games that people either love or hate some people claim it s far too similar to other games namely the final fantasy series which is understandable since it was originally intended to be sony s equivalent of final fantasy honestly i can t comment on the similarities beyond that as i m not very familiar with the ff games i think my favorite aspect of the game is the battle system not only do you have the ability to change into a more powerful dragoon form but every time you attack you have to pay attention in order to complete the attack by pressing buttons at the correct time not only that sometimes enemies will attack you back right in the middle of a sequence which means you have to press different buttons in order to avoid taking damage even the use of certain attack items requires a bit of button mashing if you don t want to attack you can always guard which not only cuts any damage taken in half but raises your hit points without the use of healing potions the fmvs are quite well done about the same quality as final fantasy s however the graphics during game play aren t quite up to that standard they re nice but they could have been and honestly should have been better the translation as well leaves something to be desired not only does it raise interesting character relationship questions but there are also some grammatical mistakes that simply shouldn t have been allowed to pass another thing i found interesting was that you lose main party characters one dies and the other basically becomes useless to the party and leaves while the death of the one character is often said to have no point it makes you realize early on that the characters while heroes are still just as mortal as the next person the people who replace the lost characters simply gain all their stats so the transition game play wise is fairly smooth perhaps my one complaint about the characters is the main character s love interest shana she is the epitome of the helpless female in need of rescuing pathetic to the point of driving a player to screaming with frustration while you can use her in your party she is insanely weak i don t even know what her dragoon powers are like as i disliked her so much i never used her the character rose by contrast is probably my favorite female character in any game ever she s no wimp and some of her dragoon magic is extremely useful meru is quite strong as well while sometimes being an annoying talkative brat the character designers were as most are inclined to make the female characters appear pretty or whatever and didn t give much thought to the actual usefulness of the outfits seriously no armor and having most of your skin exposed is not helpful when fighting monsters but i will give them props as they do have females serving as knights in the various countries i can t comment much on the plot as honestly i didn t pay much attention to it beyond where i needed to go to next i m not sure if this says something about the plot itself or my gaming style all in all it s a very enjoyable game it has its flaws but for me it struck just the right balance of having to think and just pressing buttons and killing monsters
when i saw this movie a few days ago my eyes were completely fixed to the screen its greatness held my attention to such an extent that i focused all of my attention on it for its entire duration i would recommend seeing it not just to fans of anime but to anyone who likes great movies period or who likes really weird stuff the style of art is beautiful the sound is perfect and the symbolism within it is breathtaking i ve heard complaints about the weird insertion of english text in the movie but i think the way its done is complementary to the strange style of the movie the self attributed description of hello kitty on acid doesn t do justice to this film of absolutely epic proportions i d like to find more works by whoever made this and see them
antwone fisher is the story of a young emotionally troubled u s navy seaman his problems lead him to jerome davenport a psychiatrist who helps him realize that his troubles stem from his childhood upbringing get ready to shed a tear or two the movie could thaw the coldest heart i loved the story which turns from something so very awful to happen to anyone into a positive ending antwone fisher is a powerful movie most importantly about forgiveness other important issues that get you thinking are child abuse adoption and foster care oscar winner denzel washington does an impressive job in his directorial debut there were many scenes which i enjoyed watching they included the beginning dreams of a little boy check out the gigantic sized pancakes and the ending dreams turned into reality which beautifully tied the story together another wonderful scene occurred when the doctor encouraged antwone to search for his family to find answers to his questions about his family that abandoned him my favorite scene happened when the young man finally confronted his mother and her reaction towards him priceless all the actors represented their parts well in addition to directorial responsibilities mr washington continues to show why he won an oscar award and is successful in all his acting roles he had a strong presence in this movie actor derek luke demonstrated why he was so right for the part of antwone fisher he portrayed very real and heart tugging work joy bryant who played the part of cheryl antwone s love interest resembled a ray of sunshine on the screen the chemistry flowed well between the romantic characters novella nelson who played the part of mrs tate a despicable character deserves special mention although we only see her for a few minutes the actress who played fisher s mother gave an outstanding performance everyone should see antwone fisher
this documentary was very thorough and exposing and at the same time entertaining which i thought was rather impressive i felt as if they did a very good job covering the sport from its origin until present day but nonetheless there is a reason why i do not give such a high score to this film i felt as if at times the story focused too much on the proper nouns of the sport so to speak too much on individual locations at which to surf and especially too much on individual surfers i felt as if the documentary had more to do with the nature of the sport the ideology of the sport etc it would have been better although this of course was covered i do not think it got as much time as it warranted and for many people who are not absolutely nuts about surfing at times hearing them go on and on about specific locations and specific surfers could become boring although the video clips and the in depth research is well respected it could have been presented in a way that would be better for those who are not avid surfers furthermore my biggest disappointment was at times they spoke of how utterly amazing and miraculous certain events in surfing history were yet they did not have the actual footage of these events unfolding and the whole time you are waiting to see on the silver screen this amazing breath taking event that these men are talking about as life changing moments and in the end all you get is a lot of men talking about it and not the actual footage it was far too tantalizing to myself to hear these stories and then be unable to see them i understand the difficulty of obtaining footage of everything but please do not brag an event up so much and then not show it overall a very fresh documentary that i enjoyed watching not the best documentary due to the above reasons but being very fresh and having some extremely exciting footage and a good soundtrack it is a documentary that i would advise everybody to check out
it isn t always easy to explain what a movie is like but this time i think i ve found it it reminded me of two movies trainspotting small time criminals scoring some drugs and doing some stupid things in schotland and the blair witch project because of the style of filming it s about the loyalty between two friends one of them is coming out of jail the other one hasn t been caught yet with a stolen vehicle they drive through the scottish countryside but than run out of petrol as they try to find some fuel they find a farm in the middle of nowhere the farmer thinks they want to rob him and points a gun at one of them than it all goes wrong one of the friends accidentally shoots the farmer s daughter and they have to run what follows is a man hunt through the fields and woods of schotland the two friends literally have to run for their lives apparently this movie was shot in only days time ok that s not exactly unbelievable because the biggest part of it is always in the same place the scottish countryside but i still find that quite amazing especially because this isn t actually a bad movie it s perhaps not the greatest movie ever but they still can be proud of what they achieved i had a nice time watching it and overall i enjoyed the movie i give it a
this was a pretty good movie i liked it i thought it was a pretty accurate look at bulimia and how it s not about dieting it s about having a pain so deep that they have to find a way to deal with it and they choose this beth was a very accurately drawn character and in the scene where she confronts her mom about the eating disorder you can see the pain inside her and hear it in her voice and you know how deep the pain is that she is feeling i also think one of the best lines in the movie is where beth yells the words it s not about you to her mother those words were so true and added so much to that scene in the movie i think that that scene was definitely the most important scene in that movie
i don t doubt that the critics panned this movie especially the artsy fartsys who need a laxative this is a great vehicle movie in the tradition of abbot costello or more recently don knotts it won t shake the world or change movies forever what it will do is entertain when all is said done that s the most important thing anyway watch this movie forget your troubles it even has a simple kind moral message at no extra charge i always loved elvira s tv show when i lived in la she did not really steal her schtick from vampira any more than vampira did from the original theda bara this sort of mythic character belongs to whoever does it best cassandra peterson does it best long live elvira we need more of these kind of movies there are never enough the villain william morgan sheppard was also excellent he exudes a wonderful refined malice i could find no technical faults the execution is as close to flawless as the art form gets my profound compliments to the director james signorelli all his crew
to watch this film from start to finish without bursting into laughter at some point requires almost an act of faith as one has to keep saying to oneself it s old it s a classic be kind not because the movie is so bad but because at its best it s so good this is one dated movie it s also a classic if a tarnished one i m not inclined to laugh at people anyway on principle and i get more than a little irritated when others do so to make fun of the informer to my mind is a little like giggling at an idiot savant when he dribbles his orange juice all over the tablecloth yes one says to oneself he is an idiot and yet when he s on top of his game he is also a true savant the same is true for the informer which is on occasion very dreadful indeed and yet it boasts splendid photography some fine acting a wonderful score and a good decent simple story in the end which i won t give away politics religion and psychology come together in a church in such a way as to make the scene seem corny and over the top and yet so is life sometimes uneducated people of simple faith behave differently from us presumably brilliant modern folks and the scene isn t so much unbelievable i buy it but i know the irish as embarrassing yet people do behave that way they do say things like that not everyone is hip and it may not even be desirable for everyone to be hip are people today so much superior to those of seventy or eighty years ago and in what way i don t think so we re just different now go watch the movie
after seeing this film at the sf independent film festival i couldn t wait to hear about how to get a copy jim mckay gave a talk q a about the film afterward which presented his ironic situation how to get distribution for a film which portrays minorities women non whites working on resolving controversial issues teen pregnancy teen motherhood racial identity single mother households and how to write a faithful script on all of these topics being a mid thirties white male the multi racial multi gendered audience of mostly adults raved about the film s fantastic storyline detailed characters and fantastic portrayal of real teen life most of the teens however had left the building leading me to think this is a film best seen by adults with kids as a starting point for discussion rather than as many adults there felt a film teens should see because it s about them hence distribution questions how do we get our hands on it the internet retail would be a great path this is a film that will be buried like pups or other radical modern teen films and mckay seemed responsive as for his credits as a writer director mckay was extremeley sensitive and detailed in his work allying himself to the crown heights neighborhood in which the film is set working with actors to portray characters in their own vision of what they think should be with the results being disarmingly realistic
some of the posters seem less than gruntled because this is neither mark twain nor rodgers and hart but clearly it doesn t pretend to be either you ll look a long time to find a greater rodgers and hart fan than me but burke and van heusen weren t exactly chopped liver in addition to which they knew der bingle inside out and tailored some great songs but beautiful moonlight becomes you it s always you the day after forever etc to fit his highly personal style and here they come up with yet another fine and unfairly neglected ballad once and for always plus a couple of upbeat philosophy lite entries in if you stub your toe on the moon and busy doing nothing the flimsy plot isn t meant to be taken seriously why else make merlin a heavy when in most if not all of the other versions he is more a friend mentor to arthur so if you start wondering aloud why sir lancelot who has been sold to historians as the epitome of chivalry and uprightness metamorphoses into a schoolyard bully you re not going to get much fun out of what is essentially a fun movie on balance it does what it sets out to do entertain so good luck to it
saw this a couple times on the sundance channel several years ago and received a nice cinematic jolt to the system a semi surreal yet hard edged take on modern media culture or the lack of it focusing on some seriously wacked way beyond the hollywood fringe dwellers it had an amusing early performance from mark ruffalo and some memorable cinematography from the dp who did the polish brothers movies there was a savage umcompromising humor and a weirdly original feel to it that definitely set it apart this film had cult classic written all over it and i m surprised it s not yet out on dvd hopefully soon
i watched this film a few times in the s and nearly split my sides laughing each time i love eddie murphy as an actor but this stand up is some thing else he is so funny even the p c brigade would find this hilarious it s a must watch and even better if you ve got the guys or girls in for a drink the take off of michael jackson is so like him if you close your eyes you believe it s him singing the things he describes are true to life and you would seriously have to have a humour bypass if you thought this was not funny my local video stores do not stock this video any more but i would love to get my hands on a copy to show my husband and boys when they are old enough to appreciate the humour anyway highly recommended hope you enjoy
four words account for why this film was made she done him wrong the huge commercial success of that mae west vehicle convinced the studio brass that gay s melodramas were a viable proposition here we are rewarded with a fast moving well written romp which neatly targets the personalities of its stars wallace beery and george raft are excellent as friendly rivals jackie cooper is a little harder to take but it is fay wray who steals the film with her stock in trade damsel in distress with a strong director as walsh proves himself to be wray could carry a lot of punch and she is utterly believable as the object of both raft and beery s affection lots of atmosphere beautifully designed this is a forgotten film worthy of revival
just watched it on sky tv missed the first half an hour i did wonder if it was a true story so watched it to the end there was no brief at the end to say what happened to everyone it did remind me of speed but at the end of the day i don t suppose it was released at the cinema as we did see the following error the goof that we saw was that they remove the bonnet hood and then later on there are two shots of the car with the police car in front trying to slow it down when the bonnet is back on it did have me on the edge of my seat especially when i thought the baby was going to hit the bridge and of course when the bridge wasn t going to be lowered and then it was i m afraid i did burst into tears so it wasn t that bad
this peabody award winning episode is one of the highlights of the st season where a holodeck malfunction traps captain picard beverly data and a starfleet historian named waylan within a s san francisco setting this episode is an homage to raymond chandler s maltese falcon where patrick stewart assumes the humphrey bogart role complete with fedora and trenchcoat the office itself is almost an exact replica of the one featured in bogey s maltese falcon this episode also briefly introduces us to a mysterious insect race called the jarada that communicate with mostly a high pitched buzzing sound communication with this alien race is difficult and it is up to picard to communicate with this race in their native tongue so that negotiations and diplomacy can finally begin the best part of this episode though is the appearance of the famous hollywood b actor lawrence tierney in the role of the gangster cyrus redblock he was such a handsome man back in the s oh well
the film belongs to inventor underdog genre jake gyllenhaal laura dern and chris cooper bring a little acting verve to story with several standard elements well filmed well edited with plenty of well acted secondary roles some have declared this movie to be classic american hokey it is that and more i agree with those who say the movie celebrates the thrill of youthful inspiration the film is a pleasant reminder that achievement may be born of ordinary roots
the shop around the corner is a pleasant romantic comedy not the sort that i will hold dear to me until the end of my days but nonetheless a film thoroughly deserving of its reputation by director ernst lubitsch had long ago taken hollywood by storm and his famed lubitsch touch had become a sparkling commercial trademark this film was planned for a release but scheduling conflicts meant that james stewart and margaret sullavan were unavailable for filming rather than substituting either of his main stars lubitsch decided to postpone production in the meantime directing greta garbo in ninotchka when it was finally completed the shop around the corner appears to have been met with relative indifference receiving zero oscar nominations despite an excellent screenplay by samson raphaelson and fine performances from its two leads and frank morgan in a supporting role time nevertheless has betrayed the film s massive and enduring influence with high profile remakes including in the good old summertime and you ve got mail at its surface one might assume the shop around the corner to simply be the story of two lovers klara novak sullavan and alfred kralik stewart who love each other without knowing it however lubitsch s film runs much deeper than that it s the story of matuschek and company a stylish gift shop in budapest and the various human relationships that make the store such a close knit family when store owner hugo matuschek frank morgan begins to suspect his oldest employee of having an affair with his wife we witness the breakdown of two families both at home and at work there s absolutely no reason why the story should not have been set in the united states perhaps in the blustery streets of new york but lubitsch was deliberately recreating the passions and memories of his former years in europe the quaintness of love and life before war brought terror and bloodshed to every doorstep this subtle subtext brings a more meaningful personal touch to the film in fact even as i write this review i m beginning to appreciate the story even more sullavan and stewart are both lovely in their respective roles but i think that it s the supporting cast that really make the film each character brings a distinctive personality to the mix and their interactions are always believable and enjoyable i especially liked how lubitsch knowingly directed much of our sympathy towards hugo matuschek who in any other film would have been restricted to an underdeveloped two dimensional portrayal matuschek may have lost the love of his family but he recaptures it in the affection of his employees and you feel a heartwarming glow when in the bitter cold of a christmas eve snowstorm he finds companionship in a freckle faced young errand boy charles smith this genuine warmth towards a supporting character strikes me as being similar to several of billy wilder s later creations for example boom boom jackson in the fortune cookie or carlo carlucci in avanti of course it doesn t really need saying but billy wilder learned from the best
there were a lot of things going against this movie for me before i watched it first i was a typical high school senior in a shakespeare class i didn t really even like much less understood half of shakespeare would be no more than unintelligible without me pouring all my concentration into his almost encrypted plays encrypted with his extremely difficult to understand language and then i still wouldn t get most of it second it was hours long i never thought that could be a good thing well let me tell you something this movie was so masterful so beautiful i actually understood all the language as it was being performed now the script was followed to the letter in this movie the same script that was incomprehensible to me in shakespeare class and here i was my mind opening and me understanding it i was doubting myself while watching the movie almost but lo and behold when performed and only then shakespeare comes to life so this version of hamlet showed me that shakespeare is indeed a master who wrote great stories when i saw it on the big screen especially in the high budget major motion picture style with beautiful cinematography and photography and acted amazingly by brannagh and cast somehow i understood what was going on what was being said the language is awesome and passionate it allows for more raw emotion when words can t describe something maybe shakespeare s words can i still hold to this day that fist of the north star animated english dub is the greatest movie ever made no movie provides more sheer entertainment but for a movie to come close to dethroning fist from that position which hamlet did it came close is truly amazing awe inspiring it wasn t a movie it was an event even more amazing it made me appreciate shakespeare wow powerful powerful is the word one of the rare truly powerful movies out there this gets hundred trillion stars out of infinity stars yes yes by the way all you kids out there in a shakespeare class forget it you re wasting you re time you have to see the plays performed only then will justice be done to them
although i like kurt vonnegut i m not particularly interested in spy stories and i didn t know this one the only reason i watched it was nick nolte who is one of my favorite actors since i saw breakfast of champions and hotel rwanda but the film brought me a pleasant surprise of course nolte was great but so was the plot there was relatively little political intrigue and much more focus on the moral question by reading his anti semitic radio commentaries with hidden secret messages to americans he in fact contributed to the general attitude of germans and as it later turns out americans towards jews or hitler which carries more weight his service to his country or his unconscious contribution to anti semitism the dilemma is even more prominent as these words are never spoken not even as narration howard campbell jr nolte is a person who learnt to hide his feelings so perfectly that he doesn t open up not even in his memoirs the inner conflict of such a character is almost impossible to portray but with the help of excellent acting and photography this film manages there are other points to it such as the humor or the ironical use of romantic clich s like the song white christmas that make it real different from average american movies i recommend it to everyone who is bored with hollywood spy movies
the woman in black is a tv adaptation of susan hill s modern classic ghost story published only a few years earlier than the film was made sadly this film has not been released on dvd and as far as i am aware it has been deleted on vhs it s availability is in direct contrast to it s popularity amongst those in the know about horror films the story revolves around events in a seaside community in the early th century where a young solicitor is sent by his firm to conclude the affairs of a recently deceased widow who died on her isolated marshland estate what he thought would be a routine and probably tedious task turns into a nightmare as he discovers that the old woman was haunted to her death and that the ghosts of her past are not content to rest the story is told in a subtle but concise way never being self indulgent flashy or over expositional the obviously tight budget may have contributed to the no nonsense approach but it s just what the story needs and why it works so well it s what you don t see that scares having said that there is one particularly terrifying scene that relies on the visual and it works to perfection i watched this film during the day and it still gave me nightmares nearly a week later if you love being terrified do what you must to get hold of and watch a copy of the woman in black
after movies and three years of working in hollywood bette davis finally got a role she claimed as her own and which put her as a force to be reckoned with as mildred rogers davis burst forth with a completely unsympathetic role of a slutty waitress who becomes the target of leslie howard s affections and already eager to sink her teeth into a role like this she had no qualms of the awful things her character was meant to do throughout the course of the film and the awful transformation she would undergo it also has been widely noted that her performance here one of the few things that makes this slightly uneven movie watchable has been the one to remember even after two remakes and the scenes where she rips into howard have made cinema history at circa minutes the story moves at a nice pace telling the story of philip carey howard as his life crosses that of the destructive mildred rogers over and over again howard and davis chemistry is all but non existent davis sustained in an interview much later in life she personally didn t care much for howard s iciness towards her and that helped her act even worse in character towards him as mildred all the same the two seem awkward with one another their scenes together remain stiff only salvaged by the ferocious acidity davis brings to her lines and her own nervous presence then again cromwell s direction has a certain stiltedness about itself that fails to come through at times he tries to fill in some space whenever davis is not there with dissolves and montages indicating the passing of time a calendar superimposed over a changing frances dee all much in the style back then this was before technicalities and complicated camera angles came into being and in essence the visual story is a simplified bare essentials translation of the somerset maugham s novel which is saying a lot since at pages of human bondage would have been indeed hard to film even then storywise it feels that philip carey may be something of a glutton for punishment since there is no discernible sexual attraction between he and mildred and to compound that mildred never hides her displeasure from the get go howard s performance never seems to go through much external emotion his eyes are constantly sad his expression never veers too far away from lost he could almost be a distant cousin to william hurt in the accidental tourist dejected hurt and absolutely passive but this is possibly a part of his character and the reason he fails to see that other women played by kay johnson and frances dee are making themselves vulnerable to unrequited affections interestingly johnson s norah once she realizes carey will never fall for her is the one who sums the story up with her observation that people are bound to other people she is bound to carey as carey is bound to mildred and mildred herself is bound to miller or men who fit the role of provider in her short but memorable scene she s the one who holds the essence of the story s moral
he is the quintessential narcissist and manipulator in this case portraying attorney and murderer tom capano kathryn morris is sympathetic as victim anne marie fahey but in the beginning is a bit too much the victim we are sorry for the situation but become simultaneously disgusted after seeing his victimization of several other women including rachel ward as well the sad part is where she is actually getting help with her self esteem issues and capano actually had her psychologist killed pretty hard to believe but this was based on a true story there is a cameo with olympia dukakis excellent as capano s mother all in all an interesting story because it is based on a true murder and you will want to read ann rule s book to get the accurate details
yes commitment let s say fever pitch might trick you into believing it s a baseball movie but no you don t have to be a baseball fan to actually enjoy this picture from the farrelly brothers but of course if you are one you will enjoy it even more with all the references pretty accurate ones i d say to the boston red sox and its bittersweet history from the curse of the bambino and everything attributed to it including those two words you cannot pronounce in front of a boston fan bill buckner drew barrymore and jimmy fallon portray two people who usually might have second thoughts of going into a relationship the successful workaholic who is also affluent meeting a school teacher thing is fallon s character wins barrymore s heart by being funny caring sweet and downright perfect but her friends ask her a logical question if he s such a keeper why is he still on the market enter the boston red sox he s been so committed to his team ever since his uncle passed his sox season tickets to him he has never missed a red sox home game at fenway park in a long while and that delicate balance how much is the workaholic willing to give up for his guy s obsession and how much is that baseball crazed teacher willing to compromise in order to keep the other love of his life is what this movie is all about at first you might think that the sports obsession bits of the movie are exaggerated for comic relief well i m sad to admit they are not myself as a die hard houston astros fan can say they are all true i would try at every way available to see every stros game listen to them on the radio or follow them on the internet i read the chronicle s sports section every day and yes my room looks like the shed minute maid park s gift shop with a closet full of astros gear including jerseys t shirts and you know the rest fallon s character even has the red sox mbna mastercard fallon was credible enough as the fanatical red sox faithful even though he could pull it off without becoming a cartoon thank god adam sandler wasn t in it and the plot revolved around how this couple tried to manage with each other s passions i d say it ll be a classical romantic comedy not enough to be among the best movies in history but certainly breaks a mold into the genre and is appealing enough for men and women alike
even though it has one of the standard revenge price plots this film is my favorite of vincent price s work gallico has that quality that is missing in so many horror film characters likeability when you watch it you feel for him you feel his frustration the injustices against him and you cheer him on when he goes for vengeance even though he frightens you a little with his original fury as the film goes on his character becomes tragic he s committed his murder but now he must kill to cover that up and again to cover that one up and again your stomach sinks with his soul as it goes down its spiral like watching a beloved brother turn into a hood even if the revenge story is of old the plot devices themselves are original gallico uses his tricks to kill in more and more inventive ways a shame this one isn t available for home veiwing
two things haunt you throughout l intrus the intruder who s the intruder and is it a movie or a dream you re watching the ending is so shocking that for a while you re at a loss for an answer to either of those questions the intruder pops up as different characters different men in different circumstances who don t belong in the scene so they re expelled from it kindly or brutally but often without emotional involvement the main character louis is a contemptible man he s got rough ways some mean job and no heart he needs one and goes after it he has a heart transplanted and afterwards decides to start a new life can this man succeed in his quest for redemption a guy like that could cut your throat at the drop of a hat you know it but claire denis doesn t encourage you to judge him occasionally there s a young russian woman a beautiful girl who seems to inhabit someplace between heaven and earth who does judge him she may even punish him but not denis there s the character played by beatrice dalle who wants no business with him don t touch me she says but denis lets this man be himself films him in his self absorbed quest i don t know if what she films is the heart or the mind but it isn t the traditional plot basics whatever she films you get it in the end you know who s the intruder you know why more or less and some scenes come back to your mind with their full meaning but was it a movie or a dream
a charming little film set in the uk about the reunion of a wwii all girl almost swing band a fine cast of oldsters bring lighthearted perspectives on life to this fun tale with an award winning performance by dench and laine s always great pipes time well spent and a fun watch for all
to all the reviewers on this page i would have to say this movie is worth seeing so it was made in so what the fashion in the movie was exactly the same fashion of its time people who didn t study culture of the decades would think that this movie is a cheese ball compared to the modern series left behind which is made for our time right now it does look cheezy however the only cheezy part of the movie is the fashion which again was over years in the past but the message that is sent in this film is very powerful and carefully preserved there is just so much to say but i refuse to say it for fear of spoiling it so go out and see this film if you don t like the message that it sends then you have issues that need some attention
french production in which leading film directors from countries were invited to create minute short films conveying their reflections on the events of september the film segments vary widely in content and quality two allude to u s complicity in terrorist acts in chile against allende who died on september depicted in the segment by british director ken loach and in palestine by u s backed israelis shown in the segment from egyptian director youssef chahine two more recall other destructive acts a palestinian suicide bombing in tel aviv shot by israeli director amos gitan the japanese holy war against the west in ww ii by shohei imamura ironies abound in several stories shadows that darken the new york city apartment of a grieving old man suddenly disappear as the world trade towers telescope to the ground in sean penn s piece bringing the man momentary joy but in this bright light he can finally see that his wife is really gone in mira nair s film based on a real incident a missing young man also in new york city the son of a pakistani family is first presumed to be a fugitive terrorist but later he proves to a hero who sacrificed himself trying to save others in the towers there are poignant moments dotted throughout loach has his exiled chilean man quote st augustine to the effect that hope is built of anger and courage anger at the way things are courage to change them imamura tells us that there is no such thing as a holy war samira makhmalbaf shows a teacher with her very young afghan schoolchildren exiled in iran trying to tell them about the events that have just transpired in new york but they are understandably more impressed with a major event in their refugee camp where two men have fallen into a deep well one killed the other sustaining a broken leg this is comprehensible tragedy on a grand scale for the year olds idrissa ouedraogo from burkina faso creates a drama in which the son of an ailing woman spots osama bin laden in their village and gathers his buddies to help capture the fugitive terrorist in order to get the million u s reward he tells his friends not to let any of the adults know their plans for the older folks would merely waste the money on cars and cigarettes while he plans to help his mother and others who are sick and destitute it is mexican director alejandro gonzalez inarritu maker of amores perros who provides by far the most powerful and chilling segment one that for the most part shows only a darkened screen with audio tape loops of chanting and voices and occasional thudding sounds brief visual flashes gradually permit us to see bodies falling from the high floors of the towers and it dawns on us that the thuds are these bodies hitting the ground the sequence ends with elegiac orchestral music and a still shot bearing a phrase first shown only in arabic then with a translation added does god s light guide us or blind us in various languages with english subtitles grade b seen on if you d like to read more of my reviews send me a message for directions to my websites

very good martial arts film and jet li is the best since the master himself bruce lee li is excellent as the low key librarian cop who saves all time and time again he has a presence and a look that is riveting and believable as the kung fu king that you don t mess with francoise yip is simply beautiful in that mixed race original way that is unique because of her mixed heritage she has an innocence and an allure all at the same time that i found unforgettable the villain the man with the sunglasses and long hair was very good as well but i can t find his name in the credits can some one help me out with that thanks enjoy hak hap or black mask in any language its good entertainment
john garfield plays a marine who is blinded by a grenade while fighting on guadalcanal and who has to learn to live with his disability he has all the stereotypical notions about blindness and is sure he ll be a burden to everyone the hospital staff and his fellow wounded marines can t get through to him neither can his girl back home played by eleanor parker he s stubborn and blinded by his own fears self pity and prejudices it s a complex role that garfield carries off memorably in a great performance that keeps one watching in spite of the ever present syrupy melodrama the best scenes are on guadalcanal where he s in a machine gun nest trying to fend off the advancing japanese soldiers in a hellish looking night time battle and later a dream sequence in the hospital where he sees himself walking down a train platform with a white cane dark glasses and holding out a tin cup all the while his girlfriend walks backward away from the camera
i didn t approach still crazy with any real anticipation just another rock n roll picture i figured good nostalgia for the baby boomers this film is partially that but so much more brian gibson the director previously helmed a biography of tina turner and is quite successful in his style i suppose it is fitting that this was his last film the cast is well chosen bill nighy is perfect in his role as the band s frontman actor turned director bruce robinson appears as the band s washed up guitarist he does a superb job even though he hasn t appeared on film since the late s if you re looking for an touching and funny film with some great songs you ve found it out of
spoilers is a very good and very realistic documentary about the attacks on the wtc french film makers who are in new york to film the actions of a nyfd are being confronted with this event and make the most of it before nothing much really happens which gives the movie an even more horror like scenario on the day of the attacks it seems like just another dull day at work but this will soon change as one the film makers goes on the road with the firemen he films the first crashing plane this is the only footage of the first impact he rides with the firemen to the wtc and goes inside the building as the second plane crashes the people understand that this is not an accident in the next period of time we see firemen making plans to save as many people as possible in the meanwhile we hear banging sounds these are the sounds of people who jumped down from the tower and falling on the ground this is the most grueling moment in the documentary then the tower collapses and our french friend has to run for his life you hear him breath like a madman while he runs out of the building then a huge sort of sandstorm blasts over him and the screen turns black he was very lucky to survive and now he can film the empty streets of downtown new york because this documentary has got so much historical footage and because the film was ment to be something totally different this documentary will probably stay in everybody s memory i saw the attacks live at home because i had the afternoon of so this makes it even more realistic to watch
excellent pirate entertainment it has all the good ingredients to keep one s attention an absorbing tale of intrigue a fiery lady pirate named spitfire stevens maureen o hara who s attracted to the irresistible mr hawke errol flynn who is out on a secret mission of his own they make a fine romantic pair onscreen sigh anthony quinn is the mean bad pirate weaving his villainous web of divide and conquer i noticed the very familiar face of mildred natwick playing a supporting role as mrs macgregor the protector of young princess patma alice kelley there is beautifully filmed scenery of shorelines ships and the bay lots of action too of sword fighting clashes ship battles daring leaps of errol flynn robin hood on board ship from the flaming redhead herself i once heard in an interview of maureen o hara that she boasted great command of the bullwhip and could also outdo flynn in sword fighting in those days but there d be no need to put it to the test here very enjoyable movie
as a sequel this is not a bad movie i actually liked it better than the st one i found it more entertaining it seemed like it was shot documentary style at first this bothered me as i thought it just looked too low budget but it grew on me and it made the movie seem more authentic this movie has more dry one liners than the original which is a good thing in my opinion i do think at times they went a bit over the top with some of the scenes and the characters it almost becomes a parody of itself which may be the point this movie at least has some suspense which the st one did not have in my view it has some of the same great music from the original which is great the acting again was pretty decent for the most part though like i said some of it seemed over the top i also felt that the movie loses a lot of momentum towards the end and there are a few minutes which seem really slow and just don t seem to flow like the rest of the movie overall though i thought this was a pretty sequel my rating for return to cabin by the lake is
oliver twist was to have controversy as well as success following it after dickens published it in his picture of life in the urban ghettos was something shocking and new and his making the central figures of the novel include criminals was another innovation one day he was walking in london and passed a young woman he had been friendly with he said hello but she was rather stiff with him he could not understand this a few days later they met again and he asked what he had done to upset her well if you must know i did not like your last novel she said really everyone else thinks highly of it he was puzzled what s wrong with it oh charles she said i m jewish how could you make up such a character like fagin he had not expected this well you know that trial last year of ikey solomon the thief trainer he s a model for fagin and he was jewish dickens found that did not settle things yes she replied he got what he deserved but charles they did not call him solomon the jew like you call fagin the jew moreover solomon did not plan a murder fagin does dickens had to admit that he might have gotten carried away he left thinking about what she said oliver twist was published in several editions dickens tried to improve on fagin a bit then he got an idea he reworked the chapter called fagin s last night alive showing the fears in the man as he faced hanging he also added some additional details he let his female friend know about his resolve to change fagin a day or so later he met her at a friend s house she looked at him as though he was crazy didn t you like the changes he asked charles what changes he s still a vile villain called the jew she replied yes i did keep those in but didn t you see how frightened he was in the death cell in prison the young woman had noticed this but felt that he was so vile he deserved to be suffering such fears ah then i was right about that and did you see the little details i added he asked what details she replied when you first see fagin now he is cooking himself dinner you read that dickens looked at her expecting a sign of recognition instead the lady looked confused i read he was at the fireplace but i must have skimmed the passage dickens smiled as though he was brilliant he is cooking a pork sausage for his dinner a what she exclaimed he s eating pork my dear see he s not a good jew his friend looked at him shook her head and to his dismay left their friend s house she didn t speak to him for years dickens never totally shook off his own bigotries but the situation did lead to a partial attempt at amends in his last completed novel in our mutual friend he has a minor character mr riah who is used by an unscrupulous landlord to collect high rents from poor tenants the landlord figures that mr riah will be blamed because he is jewish but mr riah is a good man he is a very good man he is a very very very very good man so good as to be unbelievable if fagin saw mr riah in action he d probably chase him away with a stick the anti semitic image of fagin lingers to this day it is a measure of dickens genius as a writer that the novel overcomes it however in presenting the story on film it still causes problems for screenplay writers and directors how after the holocaust can one do a film treatment of a worthy novel without inflaming bigotry david lean showed how by having alec guiness appear in one or two scenes showing a human side and in confronting a mob at the end with true dignity sir carol reed in his musical version of the novel did it better yet due to a rewrite in the original musical s script oliver had been made into a west end musical hit in the middle s and then taken to broadway where it was again a hit with a wonderful score by lionel bart including food glorious food i am reviewing the situation consider yourself boy for sale who will buy as long as he needs me it deserved it s success reed did well in his casting the roles including his nephew oliver reed as sykes ron moody as fagin mark lester as oliver jack wild as the dodger shani wallis as nancy and harry secombe as mr bumble there had been no big musical successes in hollywood for a decade the last musical to win the best picture oscar had been gigi in oliver won it in and fagin how to handle the eternal problem of the caricature well in the musical fagin is not captured tried and executed for the murder that is committed after all even lean showed fagin tried to control his confederate in his actions but here fagin realizes that he is getting too old to depend on this kind of chancy life although he loses his treasures those stolen items he kept because he knew their value and admired their beauty he decides he can reform he is allowed to do so accompanied by his faithful acolyte the artful dodger i don t think dickens would have appreciated the change his female friend might have but a modern audience certainly accepts it as fitting
i bought this a year or more ago for yep left it on the shelf for ages now watching dvds while holed up with a cold this is a haunting movie brilliant performances by all involved especially the yo boy about the only smiles you get in this movie plot reminds me of perhaps my favourite movie ever grosse pointe blank but obviously that s lighthearted this is heavy hearted as a psychologist a clinical and forensic psychologist a shiver went up my spine when the identity of the new contract was revealed scary stuff brilliant work all round pete
along with it s partner this is the greatest piece of animation ever created the images and styles are amazing and match perfectly with the story which is a brilliantly realistic reinterpretation of our own world where is has been and where it could go quite affecting and sometimes painful to watch it it a masterpiece of the visual art
there is star trek canon lots of it from canon we know the history of the future advances in technology events places first contacts with new beings names dates etc enterprise pretty much disregards much of st canon an unfortunate fact for long time serious fans as one i assumed that the producers would at least take a look at the first few episodes of tos and retro back from there but no the phase pistols like much of the technology look much more modern than found in tos an old style starfleet laser gun a slow gold speckle transporter effect that s what i expected to see also i did not expect to hear pure beep based sound effects similar to tng but far apart from tos sound effects in the earliest view of tos the original pilot the cage we see a starfleet with a more formal military aspect a bit of old earth navy with enterprise we see a shocking disregard for rank there is more military code in the cartoon star blazers than in enterprise it is fine that captain archer is unsure about the needs of the universe quite unlike kirk who never lacked confidence in his application of human justice but inside enterprise everyone seems like an equal unprofessional unsure more distant from the feel of formal military service than found in any st series and that says a lot the casual country music opening theme song heralds the journeys of a family rather than the adventures of an important large military vessel enterprise looks to show us a mostly fun warm fuzzy exploration of human relationships rather than take us on a historic bold gritty high rick exploration of space i would have selected adrian paul to play the captain and an older human to be the doctor still i liked the actors for the most part linda park an outstanding ballroom dancer from boston college is sure to develop nicely the characters making up the crew seem to be thoughtfully created enterprise begins its run stronger than did the past three star trek series let s hope for a good future
an old family story told to two young girls by their grandfather is brought to life years later as he foretold people are getting murdered and blood is being spilled and rats are scampering all over and naked bodies are being enjoyed kitty barbara bouchet is the suspect but we know she is not the killer is it franziska marina malfatti is it evelyn back from death for revenge is it a plot to steal an inheritance the color is superb in this thriller from emilio miraglia who only did one other giallo as far as i know the only thing that spoiled the film was the appearance that several frames were cut out someone calls the police and suddenly they are there trying to save kitty
being a person who does not usually enjoy boxing movies feeling they only focus on the boxing and not the characters themselves this movie truly moved me i loved being able to see the main character diana michelle rodriguez go through so many things in such a short while it was amazing to me michelle rodriguez did such a wonderful job playing diana especially since this was her first acting experience she showed true emotion and portrayed diana wonderfully all actors had chemistry on screen and made this movie even more amazing i highly recommend this movie even to those who do not usually watch boxing movies
if you ve had drama in your life either your own or by someone close to you the stages of pain this woman but in my opinion it could easily have been a man too goes through are very very real it is a movie about not being able to cope with your pain about not knowing what to do to help yourself get through it obviously it then also is a movie about not knowing how to help someone close to you get through their pain it is a movie that makes you realize that everyone is alone in their suffering it is a movie that might push someone over the edge which hardly sounds like a recommendation i m not sure i would recommend someone to go see this film especially someone close but for me it is a movie that puts things into perspective that shows real pain and is therefore much relevant to being alive it makes you realize that hey you or the person close to you have lived through pain that hey all the things you worry about now are of so little importance
the bourne ultimatum jason bourne matt damon in his best role ever the newest spy kid on the block brings his quest for his identity to a close as he also seeks to end the cia s latest program blackbriar to make super assassins like himself i was so psyched for this one that i watched it s predecessors yesterday and today identity was as brilliant as i recall and supremacy remains the weak but still enjoyable link in the chain for the weakest plot and aside from a car chase which this film s chase easily tops slight lacking in action and suspense hoo boy does ultimatum have suspense even when you know bourne will escape the authorities and boy do these films spotlight the police as inept it s still brilliant watching him do it it s mind boggling to think that two guys with handguns and mopeds can create x more suspense than anything those million giant robots did in transformers chalk it up to paul greengrass who has this idiosyncratic style of shooting stedicam a la documentary even though he s filming characters that are far from ordinary in places like cia headquarters where no one within miles would be allowed with a camcorder he seemed to listen to my various complaints with supremacy as the action in ultimatum is nothing less than awe inspiring with various implements used as weapons being a candlestick a hardcover book i ll never look at those the same way again and an electric fan don t ask the music also helped generate much suspense and there was hardly ever a moment to not nail bite over the acting is good and the evolution of julia stiles character nicky put her situation into a new highly sympathetic light damon plays his signature role with reserve but competency which sounds minor but that it genuinely looks like matt damon could evade the cia and interpol is something but noticeable moments of poignancy as he still struggles to find his humanity this longing of his for a real life could get boring and almost did in supremacy but just works better in ultimatum better script i am reminded of a scene in goldeneye the only good pierce brosnan bond film in which sean bean s character asks james if the martinis ever silence the screams of all the men he s killed bourne regrets all the people he killed and he considers or at least made me consider the meaning of action without purpose life without meaning and how the government has transformed men into resources albeit resources that know krav maga and can make weapons out of anything sidenote it s always bothered me that despite being a superspy and hunted by the cia interpol and the police nearly anywhere he goes that bourne never thought to make even the smallest attempts to disguise his features or forge some new passports sunglasses maybe if you have a pulse and love action movies than bourne ultimatum is for you hell it s probably the best action film to come out this year of course you d be a fool to see it without watching the others first it kind of drags a touch near the end but i almost feel tempted to overlook that this is the first movie this summer to at least match if not exceed the original and that is saying something a
the pre release version of s baby face would make an ideal introduction to a corporate seminar on sexual harassment mentored by a nietszchean professor lily powers rises from a life of easy virtue at her father s speakeasy to a rapid climb up the corporate ladder at a large bank because each rung of the ladder is an executive with his brain below his belt and his ethics locked in the vault the film has no victims except lily s childhood which was destroyed by an abusive exploitative father the destructive relationship with her father suggests lily s hidden motive for using men to advance without regard for their fate while lily is cynical and obvious in her approach the men she targets willingly betray wives and fianc s to trade jobs for sexual favors perhaps the bank failures in the s owed less to economics than to morally corrupt executives distracted by ambitious women the plot moves fast and the camera amusingly moves from window to window up the fa ade of the office building as lily climbs ever higher barbara stanwyck reveled in tough hard bitten roles and she is in top form here sentiment does not intrude when she is ready to climb the next rung only her african american confidante chico receives lily s affection trust and loyalty in more enlightened times the fresh natural beauty of theresa harris who plays chico would have had the men throwing the furs and penthouses at her stanwyck often appears overly made up and stiffly coiffed in comparison to harris however despite stanwyck s tough demeanor obvious tactics and artificial visage she manages to leave a trail of duped and seduced men including douglass dumbrille donald cook and a young john wayne the preferred version of baby face is the minute restored cut the edited release version of the film shyly turns from the hard facts which the longer cut restores and makes explicit perhaps darryl zanuck who wrote the story under an assumed name intended a lesson by quoting from nietszche whose views on women were controversial however despite alphonse ethier s lectures and advice not to be defeated by life lily s grab for power and money likely owed more to her upbringing and her father than to her professorial mentor however the philosophy is but a distraction short fast paced and entertaining baby face is as contemporary in its morality as wall street substitute gordon gecko for nietszche and lily could have declared her guiding philosophy to be greed is good
spoilers spoilers well seeing as i am a major h lots fan maybe i liked the movie more than normal people would however this movie is still excellent it had tons of surprises and it gave some more closure to the series while i was sad that bayliss turned into a murderer the overall feeling i felt was satisfied
the government that he fought to establish to recognize his loyalty with a promised and much needed pension ripstein s lyrical work is a sweet ode to all those who like the colonel suffer under the abuses of a cynical and hardened society that strengthens itself by denying its citizens the means to live with dignity and purpose unlike the absurdity of waiting for godot the colonel s wait for the arrival of his pension gives hope and significance to his otherwise miserable life two things in the film drive the colonel who is masterfully played by fernando lujan the hope that his military pension will one day arrive and the knowledge that his son agustin died for a noble cause a reason other than a drunken fracas at a rigged cockfight unable to realize the former and forced to prove to the world the latter the colonel does the only thing he can do set about training his son s fighting cock the cock is now the warrior who can bring fortune and justice to the colonel and his asthmatic wife but his fighting ring is that of the killer of his former owner agustin in a tense scene of confrontation between the colonel and nogales his son s killer the colonel is offered by nogales a paid government agent money enough to equal the colonel s full pension but this is blood money hush money designed to hide the fact that those in power have turned their backs on one who fought for their political ideals and to conceal to the world that the warrior colonel s son was assassinated because he wrote for an underground paper that favored the rights of labor unions and the common man with maximum dignity the colonel rejects nogales offer picks up his fighting rooster and walks away as nobly as his old legs can carry him once he is at home dona lola his scolding wife wants to know why the colonel refused the money when both of them are starving in response to her continued question what are we going to eat until november when the cockfighting season begins the colonel responds shit excrement is what the poor and disenfranchised have been eating all of their lives and excrement is a meal that the colonel willingly chooses to eat with dignity knowing that he could never sell his soul to those who oppress him the colonel waits as the only man of honor and valor in a world without principles
contrary to most reviews i ve read i didn t feel this followed any of the other rock movies spinal tap etc the story was more unique although i feel most people wanted to see the sex drugs rock and roll vices that the band kept alluding to as an american i knew a few of the actors spall connelly rea surprised to find out brian bruce robinson was in zifferedi s the flame still burns my wife who hails from mexico didn t follow the english british language too well missed some of the jokes which i dutifully explained but she cried her eyes out at the concert scene she loves the song so much now funny that amazon com has the soundtrack for usd when i bought the dvd in the bargain bin at wal mart for usd price non withstanding i first saw this on late night cable and have been dying to find it ever since
a chinese scholar who criticizes harshly the arrogant nationalist warmongering policies of the ruling clique around the emperor in pre war japan is accused of being a communist and jailed for life his loving wife who supports totally her husband and his ideas is left alone to save her family from starvation this movie is a huge statue erected in praise of the role of the mother in the history of mankind sayuri yoshinaga is not less than sublime in the title role and it was a monumental scandal that she didn t get an asian oscar for the best female role in it went to a young girl with very limited acting potential this deeply moving and most human feature is a must see for all true children on earth
i thought this movie was hysterical i have watched it many times and recommend it highly mel brooks was excellent the cast was fantastic i don t understand how this movie gets a out of rating i loved it i have seen other movies of his and they were also funny but this one really stick out in my mind because of the humor his i just can t say enough about this movie i look for it to be on periodically but it never on enough for me the people playing the homeless people were by comparison up to the funniest standards also please put this movie on more often i can t see it enough leslie ann warren also was another favorite of mine ever since cinderella i always thought that she wasn t really funny but loved her acting in this movie she was very funny and her and mel did a great job together they should put more of his movies on tv
good action show but nothing new this one took place high in the mountains which showed some nice scenery and such one man takes on a group of mercenaries the lead flies and he kicks butt it could have been called rambo goes to the rockies it was that pat it did have one very effective scene right at the first of the film which had me cringing in horror not a bad picture but just same ol same ol
spaced invaders is one of the funniest movies i ve ever seen i don t understand why this movie didn t get better critics it s funny harmless and sweet i first watched it when i was and i really fell in love with it days later i got it on vhs p till today i ve shown it to many friends and they all liked it but nobody knew the movie before i think that s the problem nearly nobody knows it so nearly nobody can like it this movie never got a real chance that s sad si has really the potential of a comedy like monsters inc or spaceballs ok enough displeasure what i really wanted to say is that if you ever want to laugh your head off watch it even if you don t get mad about it it s worth watching prepare to laugh earth scum
writers perry and randy howze crafted a very engaging little story in chances are using the idea of a reincarnated man who happens to return to his former wife s home many years later the plot takes unexpected delightful turns twenty four year old robert downey jr renders a delightful performance ably assisted by cybil shepherd as the widow and ryan o neal as a good friend this trio has just the right chemistry for this caper playing off one another with a graceful style i ve watched this film a number of times on tv and each time found it most enjoyable
since september of last year i have been borrowing four to six films each week from the harold washington library which boasts an impressive dvd collection the hwl truly is a circulating library three quarters of its films are out at any given time recently i was thrilled to find the short films of david lynch yesterday knowing little about the animated series i picked up dumbland i m here to report that for david lynch fans watching the eight episodes is half an hour well spent the most remarkable feature of these brief pieces are their soundtracks each episode has its own rhythm respiratory and digestive systems provide percussion outrageous voices accent pauses ends physical violence supplies the beats chirping birds and buzzing sockets brush along the edges many other elements fill out the orchestra the pacing of the crude animation often keeps in sync with the sound but the soundtrack itself struck me as lynch s primary interest in creating and disseminating this work in a way these eight shorts are unique lynchian rhythms that said the situations are odd ugly profound dumb and funny as hell and there s enough space within them to reflect on how absurd we humans can be i can t say that i ll watch the collection again but for anyone who revelled in the movements that is the suite inland empire dumbland is worth half an hour of your time
first off consider that this film is nearly fifty years old yet it still stands up as one of the great films of all time i wonder how many of todays throwaway celluloid productions will still be talked about in the story is simple yet solid enough and the effects are nothing short of phenomenal for the day i can still recall the first time i watched this as a kid when the monster enters the force field protecting the ship and you got to see its outline for the first and only time had me shivering in fear i can tell you looks dated today but still more than effective enough the scenes with the tiger show their age now you can see the outline where the tiger was matted into the shots with altaira but they are only just visible likewise the effect whereby the creature melts its way through the krell doors are wonderfully done it s also amazing to see leslie nielsen better remembered for the airplane and naked gun movies as a young but still mature man he was when this film came out nearly now all in all a good movie that is sure to continue being a favourite for years to come timeless
although i was in this movie playing the part of sheriff hodges it still managed to make me jump in several places and believe me i m not that easy you might say that i m biased about the film and ok i am but i didn t see the finished product until and was extremely pleased i m not a horror film fan as such but love the old b movies and black and white sci fi films this movie will make you think you know when something is going to happen then it doesn t then it does it will keep you completely off balance i would suggest watching the movie first then the director s notes and special features it is so well written directed and filmed and i can tell you personally that it was a real joy to work with this cast and crew i sincerely hope to be part of brian and laurence s future projects
this isn t bonnie and clyde or thelma and louise but it is a fine road movie it sets up its two main characters gently and easily viewers learn the underlying tensions quickly which is a tribute to the director there is the young french and english speaking son who wants to do well in france has a french girlfriend and who drinks alcohol parties as young men do and there is his moroccan arabic and french speaking father who devoutly follows his muslim faith with generosity and the wisdom of elders and who rejects the new culture surrounding him like mobile phones the film could explore very powerful politics the odd couple drive thru the former yugoslavia thru turkey and then thru the middle east to get to mecca these are areas where the muslim populations have been involved in wars repression ethnic cleansing where dictators have pursued torture and summary executions to hold power and where religious communities are in constant deadly battle with each other yet the film moves thru those places and possibilities with only hints of such agendas the relationship between the two is key to this film and faith politics are the backdrop it seems to be saying that we are all human and need to understand and care for each other in order to manage well in this world it certainly isn t natural born killers and is all the better for it
evening is an entertaining movie with quite some depth all the actors and actresses turn in spectacular performances with the tremendous cast though one expects stellar acting but in this movie the expectations are exceeded one can relate to personalities and situations in ones own family as one watches the interaction of the family members one s own family memories are immediately brought to mind this is one of the few movies that inspires one to read the book usually it is the other way around one reads the book and then wants to see the movie i will definitely obtain a copy of the susan minot book and read it the rhode island scenery is spectacular as is the soundtrack any car buff will enjoy the apparently expertly restored period automobiles needless to say now but i recommend evening highly see it you will enjoy it
at the academy awards ceremony on march dorothy malone won the best supporting actress oscar for her torrid over the top portrayal of a spoiled heiress of a texas oil tycoon in written on the wind the potboiler adapted from robert wilder s novel was a veritable three ring circus showcasing alcoholism greed impotence and nymphomania malone s performance as marylee hadley a lonely rich girl who picks up men to assuage the pain of rejection from a former childhood sweetheart was representative of the movie as a whole mesmerizing to watch even as it resorts to the lowest common denominator melodrama written on the wind is ultimately the work of one man the incredibly gifted director douglas sirk an migr from pre world war weimar germany who left his european theater heritage behind to pursue a career in hollywood an extremely erudite man sirk made a name for himself in the s as universal studios reliable director of lavish soap operas most notably with ross hunter s productions of magnificent obsession all that heaven allows and imitation of life independent producer albert zugsmith offered sirk the opportunity to work outside the limiting constraints of universal s demure entertainments and create a more adult sensational product hence the sultry wind and its follow up s tarnished angels both released under the universal international banner it s anyone s guess why sirk didn t pursue loftier themes but apparently directing these exaggerated dramas appealed more to his artistic sensibilities written on the wind could be considered sirk s epic soap opera indeed it is so rife with human vulnerability and neurosis as depicted among the very rich that it is as compelling to watch as any real life domestic squabble among the rich and famous perhaps more so robert stack not an actor typically known for over emoting nearly matches malone in intensity with his offering of the weak willed brother kyle hadley a mere shadow of his patriarchal father when he finds out that he is unable to impregnate his new bride a beautifully leonine lauren bacall hadley goes off the deep end escalating an already serious drinking problem with a secret gun fetish that threatens to make him a human time bomb both brother and sister as venal and unlikeable as they are are presented as victims of their past giving them a human quality that makes them seem less monstrous and far more interesting than the good side of the family mainly bacall and the impossibly handsome rock hudson young hadley s old boyhood friend and business associate a surrogate son to the old man and malone s unattainable object of desire despite all the domestic co dependency on display it s not so much the story that is memorable here as the way it is filmed with a real panache for pictorial composition and editing director sirk draws his audience into this picture with the most heightened technicolor cinematography imaginable every single shot in this film is an eye filling canvas of saturated colors from the sight of a tank like pink cadillac pulling up to an enormous mansion s front doors to the garish decor of a luxury miami hotel a spectrum of hues almost blinding in their diversity action and dramatic scenes feature sirk s adept use of tilted camera angles shadowy lighting and cross cut editing shown to greatest effect in the scene where a rebellious drunken malone dances uninhibitedly in her upstairs bedroom to the loud blaring of a record player while her stricken father precariously ascends the huge staircase the scene is so riveting that you swear you are experiencing a great oedipal drama unfold what you re really watching is trash of an enormously entertaining kind gussied up in lurid technicolor and polished to perfection by a visual genius
rumour has it that around the time that abba the multi award winning swedish disco favourites s star had reached its zenith the band grew disillusioned with singing in english and yearned to perform in their native tongue soon after problems began to emerge in the onetime wed locked watertight partnership and recordings became less and less frequent the band dissolved albeit unofficially in and pop lost one of its most celebrated artists although they have never admitted that there s any truth in those rumours the fact remains that abba would never have been so successful had they only recorded in their native tongue if you want to appeal to the largest money making media market in the entire world then you must cater for english speaking audiences it s amazing for me how such a small island that s located a stone throw away from the european continent could have created perhaps the most recognised although not most widely spoken language in the world everyone speaks a little bit of english whether it be simply hello or a common swear word you ll find an english speaker almost everywhere pedro galindo obviously didn t agree because trampa infernal was never subtitled for global consumption until it was released recently on budget dvd that s a real shame because it s actually a decent slasher movie that s a lot better than many of its english speaking genre compatriots the film launches in the somewhat unfamiliar territory of a pistol duel two unidentified characters are shown sneaking around a dilapidated complex searching out one another for the inevitable final showdown after some suspense and a couple of near misses one of the pistoleers emerges victoriously next we learn that they were only paintball guns and the two competitors are actually youngsters from the local town nacho and mauricio are fiercest rivals and mauricio is always trying to prove himself to be better than his soft spoken opponent but as of yet he hasn t succeeded later that night whilst the victorious gunslinger celebrates his triumph with his girlfriend alejandra and his buddy charly mauricio enters the bar and says that he has one last challenge for his glorious nemesis he says that this will be the competition that will prove to the town once and for all who deserves the uttermost respect nacho is at first reluctant because alejandra warns him of the perils of continual competitiveness but he eventually succumbs to the weight of peer pressure and agrees much to the distaste of his morally superior partner they plan to head out to the remote region of filo de caballo because recent press coverage has reported that numerous people have been butchered by what locals believe to be a vicious bear mauricio proposes that whoever murders the animal can be regarded as the greatest and he also promises that it will be the last battle that he wages against his adversary after visiting the armoury to stock up on weapons and ignoring the warnings of the elderly store keeper the group set out to the remoteness of the secluded woodland hunters become hunted as they learn that the bear is actually a homicidal vietnam vet who is still unaware that the war has ended and considers all humans as his enemy what started as a competitive adventure suddenly becomes a battle for survival as they are stalked and slaughtered by the malevolent assassin i picked up trampa whilst studying in madrid from a mexican student who lived in the dorm room next door to me i remember that the copy i watched was faulty and the tape ended about minutes before the final credits rolled which meant i never got to see the final scenes thankfully i came across the budget dvd recently on amazon and immediately added it to my collection gallindo s slasher is a surprisingly good effort that excels from its skillful direction and enthusiastic plot which attempts to cover areas not usually approached by slasher movies it is in fact so good that it reminded me on more than one occasion of the arnold schwarzenegger classic predator this is especially evident in the scenes that show the creepily masked assassin jogging through the forest and stalking the panic stricken troupe as they struggle to escape the maniac s playground despite gallindo s obvious awareness of genre platitudes the bogeyman even uses a claw fingered glove a la freddy kruegar trampa also attempts to add something different to the standard template whilst the majority of the runtime plays by the concrete rules of the category the final third heralds a significant step in individuality as the maniac arms himself with a machine gun and entices the hero to his lair for the final showdown from here on the film rapidly swaps genres and becomes almost an action film which depending on your taste will either excite or disappoint you the last slasher that tried to crossbreed the two styles was that shoddy eighties entry the majorettes which is not necessarily a good thing as is the case with many latin films especially spanish flicks by almodovar and amenabar trampa has a subtle undercurrent of a moral to its story which is conveyed successfully without being rammed down the viewer s throat over indulge in the temptations of competitive masculinity and you may not always be the winner it s a sugar coated point but it s handled delicately enough not to detract from the fun of the feature trampa may be cheesy but it deserves to be seen and recognised as one of the better late slashers the killer looks great in creepy army fatigues and white valentine style mask and the attempts at originality just about work it may lack the gore that most sincere horror fans enjoy but it has enough in terms of suspense and creativity to warrant at least one viewing
this film is a wonderfully simplistic work enjoyable from start to end it is both sad yet uplifting at the same time the performances from miranda otto oh how she deserves so much more recognition and george del hoya are beautiful and yet almost painful to watch as the two tortured souls come to understand each other the supporting cast of workers at the dead letter office are wonderful bit parts in them selves as is alice s long suffering boyfriend who i couldn t help but feel slightly sorry for there s one particular scene i could watch over and over and i have it s such a shame that films like these don t get recognition and therefore bring them futher into the public eye for more people to enjoy i cried i laughed and i sighed i d recommend this film to anyone
i don t know what movie some of these other people watched but they must have seen a different joseph smith prophet of the restoration than the one i saw i think the movie was both well done and inspiring i think it s definitely worth watching it s apparent from the outset that a lot of care went into the making of this film the background scenery is beautiful i think the film does a good job of portraying joseph smith both as a man and as a prophet joseph s spiritual experiences are portrayed with taste and reverence i would definitely recommend watching this movie
castle of blood aka castle of terror is a well crafted surprisingly spooky entry from italian director anthony dawson exquisite black and white cinematography flawless dubbing superb casting fairly logical scripting deliberate pacing and a surprise though totally appropriate ending set this one apart only the films sometimes hokey music and the rather abrupt love at first sight between elizabeth barbara steele and alan georges rivi re mar an otherwise surprisingly entertaining movie while visiting england edgar allan poe sits in a pub telling one of his ghostly stories to count blackwood recognizing the great writer alan a young news reporter requests an interview with poe during the course of the conversation poe reveals that all of his stories are true incredulous alan expresses his skepticism about life after death count blackwood offers to bet alan pounds that he cannot survive this night in blackwood s castle a night following halloween when the dead walk alan cannot afford the bet so he bets his life for a pound wager unlike mario bava s overpraised black sunday aka the mask of satan castle of blood is fairly restrained making the few moments of violence even more dreadful especially surprising from a director usually associated with those terrible italian space movies from the s it s a pity the only version of this film i ve found is badly deteriorated and recorded pan and scan version even so it is well worth seeing and cries out for a modern remake perhaps with christina ricci or jennifer love hewitt in the role of elizabeth watch it and enjoy a film that compares well with robert wise s the haunting
well the story is a little hard to follow the first time but that s only because of all the bare breasted s painted up vampire witches dancing to the bongo drums this of course interrupted by a few vampiric orgies and there are some very interesting candles and uses for them and for girl on girl action vampiric or not this movie just rocks
this is a true story of an australian couple wha are charged with murder when their infant child disappears meryl streep is excellent as always and manages to hold our interest even though she plays a character who isn t particularly likable the media frenzy that surrounded this case in australia is reminiscent of the sam sheppard murder case in ohio during the s these real life situations demonstrate that the media in fact can affect how a criminal case is handled i well remember the cleveland plain dealer running a huge headline stating why isn t sam sheppard in jail the prosecutor eventually succumbed to this relentless pressure and sheppard was tried and convicted only after years in jail was he exonerated i love movies which tell a true story do it in an interesting way and make an important point in the process this is one of those movies other good movies which tell the story of innocent persons charged with crimes include hurricane the thin blue line and breaker morant in particular the latter is another australian film which is highly recommended
that hilarious line is typical of what these naughty sisters say it s funny on its own terms and pretty funny unintentionally too only two of the sisters are really bad boy are they bad too one is given to pinup poses and salacious comments where e er she goes the other is got up to look like marilyn monroe she has those sensual slightly parted lips and not to give anything away she is even more bad than the other all three sisters are played by starlets the man who stumbles into their lives is played by john bromfield he had something of a career this looks today like possibly the first mainstream soft core porn ever marketed well of course not the first but the raciest at that time the girls wear as little as possible and let s not forget about the female audience members bromfield is shown shaving with an electric razor whose fetish was this bare chested he also is shown sopping wet in a swimsuit there s a real plot here too the girls family see is cursed they are prone to suicide or dramatic deaths that can be made to seem like suicide the movie is not bad i truly don t know where it was shown maybe it was made for drive ins somehow and i could be wrong i felt that the typical male audience was not the primary target here the women are scantily dressed they often resemble lurid covers of mags like police detective or jackets of dime novels but the guy seems to be the central focus not everyone in the movie likes him but all the girls love him and i think the audience is meant to also it s lots of fun and on its own terms too
i find this movie the best movie i have ever seen because it reflects the inner strength of a young girl during the second world war the movie is impressive not least because it actually happened it reminds me of the story of anne frank
jafar panahi s comedy drama offside portrays some women trying to enter a tehran sports arena from which women are banned the official reason lots of foul language and the soccer players have their legs showing but of course it s really a case of sexism so most of the movie consists of mild comic relief as the women try to ask the men serious questions about why women are banned from the stadium and one woman even comes up with her own scheme to defy the men as i understand all of jafar panahi s movies this one included are banned in iran the real tragedy is that the cia s overthrow of the prime minister and subsequent backing of the brutal shah gave ayatollah khomeini an excuse to use his narrow interpretation of the koran to establish a chauvinistic society and that george w bush s current policy towards iran gives mahmoud ahmadinejad an excuse to act the cowboy and tighten censorship above all this is a neat look at people coming up with ways to challenge the system not a great movie but worth seeing considering that all jafar panahi s movies are banned i wonder how he s able to even make them
during eddie murphy s stand up a women from the audience yells at eddie and a man from the audience responds what is said is women do mr rob this is a character from saturday night live the man responds with shut up bitch unlike the previous post saying the women yelled do gumby this is incorrect although the post er said he was there they must have a hearing problem despite what the post er says about not being able to here it on dvd have a close listen as you actually can hear it on the dvd do mr rob i hope this helps anyone curious out the outburst cheers gaz
i wish i could laugh again as much as when i saw this show for the first time i have not done so ever since the strange thing is i find myself laughing almost as hard after watching the show again and again eddie izzard is cultivated is poignant is a man of the world he is deft talking about politics and yet feels no need to engage in political discussion he is above that i would contrast him to george carlin who uses his comedy to try and convince people about his ideas and does not seem to enjoy the fact that he is trying to entertain funniest guy on earth
an overlong but compelling retelling of the friendship between civil rights leader steve biko and donald woods the first half of the film is the strongest where we see the bond formed between the two men and how they help each other out but the second half isn t as strong due to the elimination of the biko character still its a compelling film with great performances by kline and washington in the film that put the latter on the map washington was also was nominated for best supporting actor for the first time overall a well made film that could have been trimmed down a bit
not wishing to give anything away here i would just say this technically excellent flawlessly acted and uplifting little flic will reward the viewer with an excellent hour and a half s entertainment it will amuse surprise possibly embarrass occasionally and almost certainly tug at the heartstrings from time to time as it approaches the inevitable but not obvious ending without becoming clich d or predictable in any way most definitely recommended a previous user s comment gives out of for the film and out of for both branagh and bonham carter s outstanding performances i agree entirely
the rookie kept me smiling from beginning to end dennis quaid played the role to perfection the little boy that plays his son was fantastic he made this a father son movie to remember the messages are good ones follow your dreams failing at the pursuit is alright as long as you try the excitement is palpable i believe this movie will be a classic
in le million rene clair one of the cinema s great directors and great pioneers created a gem of light comedy which for all its lightness is a groundbreaking and technically brilliant film which clearly influenced subsequent film makers such as the marx brothers lubitsch and mamoulian the plot a witty story of a poor artist who wins a huge lottery jackpot but has to search frantically all over town for the missing ticket is basically just a device to support a series of wonderfully witty comic scenes enacted in a dream world of the director s imagination one of the most impressive things about this film is that though it is set in the middle of paris and includes nothing actually impossible it achieves a sustained and involving fairy tale fantasy atmosphere in which it seems quite natural that people sing as much as they talk or that a tussle over a stolen jacket should take on the form of a football game another memorable element is that le million includes what may be the funniest opera ever put on film o that blonde braided soprano i laugh ha ha also a delight is the casting clair has assembled a group of amazing sharply different character actors each of them illustrating with deadly satiric accuracy a bourgeois french type so that the film seems like a set of daumier prints come to life the hilarity takes a little while to get rolling and i found the characters not as emotionally engaging as they can be even in a light comedy as they are for instance in many lubitsch films for these reasons i refrained from giving it the highest rating but these minor cavils shouldn t distract from an enthusiastic recommendation should you see it by all means highly recommended whether you want a classic and influential work of cinema or just a fun comedy
this is the second movie based on the life and times of ultra hung porn star john curtis estes better known as john holmes boogie nights is also roughly based on his life maybe someday someone is going to do a movie on the life of tommy byron instead the problem is that the story is not very well told there are many law order episodes that have more twists and turns than wonderland and the director never gets the criminal case going with any kind of gusto val kilmer has two problems he is not nearly as hung as holmes is and no prosthesis this time around unlike in boogie nights and he is much better looking than mope holmes the director does not introduce one single likable individual among the cast the racist immature lowlifes he hangs out with or his wife and the police don t get much in the way of characterization the best part of the movie is eric bogosian telling paris hilton to get lost having said all that anyone interested in the sleaziest side of the porn business in the s or true crime shouldn t miss it
i recently saw this film and enjoyed it very much it gives a insight to indie movie making and how much work is really involved when you have a low budget yet need a name actor actress to get people any people to come see it and give the movie exposure bobby myeres played by modine and his partner saul paul linder make an excellent combination finding eccentric miachel bates a name actor played by alan bates was a perfect casting decision in the movie and for the movie my favorite cast member was sandy ryan played by the magnificent and underrated debra kara unger with her own special performance again in the movie within the movie if you enjoy thinking when watching a comedy then this one is for you low budget meets lower budget with high laugh content
i must admit this is one of my favorite horror films of all time the unique way that john carpenter has directed this picture opening the door to so many mock genres it will chill you to the bone whether it is your first time watching it or your fiftieth the sound the menacing horror of michael meyers and the infamous scream of jamie lee curtis gives this film instant cult status and a great start for the independent era i love the music i love the characters the familiar yet spooky setting the simplistic nature of the villain and the random chaos of it all there is no really rhyme or reason to the killing in this first film giving us a taste of michael s true nature is he insane or in some way just a very brilliant beast that question may never be truly answered but carpenter gives us his and more devotion to this amazing masterpiece john carpenter is the master of horror while lately his films have not been the caliber that they once were see ghosts of mars halloween began his powerhouse of a career this is his ultimate film while he did release other greats i will always remember this one as the film that caused me to turn on all the lights beware when babysitting and check behind closed doors because you never knew where the evil would appear next carpenter has this amazing ability to bring you into the world in which he weaves with the power of his camera he places these images of meyers in places you least expected while giving you the perception as if the murderer is right next to you i loved every scene in which we panned back and there was michael watching from the distance without anyone the wiser that was scary yet utterly brilliant i loved the scenes in which carpenter pulled your fright from nearly thin air there you would be minding your own business when suddenly that horrid mask would appear out of nowhere like the characters you too thought it was just a trick of the eye but that is where carpenter gets you it isn t michael isn t a ghost he is a human being or at least we think yet he has a stronger mental ability than most of the main characters this leads into some really dark themes and unexplored symbolism but even without that this is a spooky film then if you just didn t have enough of michael just vaporizing in the windows of your house carpenter adds that chilling theme music i still have that tapping of the piano keys in my mind constantly wondering if meyers is looking at me through the window carpenter has found the perfect combination of visual frights and chilling sounds to foreshadow what may happen to our unsuspecting victims next it is lethal and it is done with refreshing originality and more unique thrills than anything released by today s horror hollywood could muster carpenter s halloween is a breath of fresh air in the midst of what could be a rough horror year with actual scares being replaced by paris hilton you know that the quality isn t quite the same finally i would like to say that even the simplistic nature of the opening murder in this film is terrifying and chilling the use of the clown mask sent shivers up my spine the way that it was filmed with that elongated one shot using the child s mask as if it were our own eyes is still one of the best horror openings ever it completely sets the tone for the remainder of that film you have the babysitter theme you have the childish behavior which carries with michael throughout the film and you have the art talent of carpenter all rolled into one i could literally speak for hours upon hours about this film but instead i would rather go watch it again it is worth the repeat visit many times overall i think this is one of the most outstanding films in cinematic history skip all those foreign films that think that they are going to chance the face of movies leave it to a budget tight carpenter and the slasher film genre this singular movie redefined a whole generation of horror films and still continues to be an influence on modern day horror treats the lethal combination of a genuinely spooky murderer the powerful cinematography of the events which normally doesn t amount to much in horror films and the beauty of jamie lee curtis is exactly what makes halloween that film above the rest sure freddy is cool and you feel sympathetic for jason but michael is real he is troubled and he is on the loose lusting for the blood of babysitters what can be better grade out of
in a group of raf officers including eric wiiliams decide to escape from a pow camp using a gymnastic vaulting horse in the courtyard in it was decided to film his account and it kick started a peculiar british film genre the military prison camp story that reached its apogee in danger within the wooden horse is one of the quietest films i have ever watched there are no great dramatic moments but a steady storyline eventually builds to a climax that has more tension because the story doesn t give way for unlikely drama jump cuts or jacked up somethings about to happen music it is utterly of its time and works beautifully leo glenn anthony steel and david tomlinson lead a curiously low key cast of extras and i suspect non actors without exception all are constantly mono tonal and quiet they keep emotion out of their roles as so many were until recently ex service i suspect they recreated their war time roles as officers and gentlemen this unemotional approach does not detract from any dramatic tension on the contrary unlike most wartime escape films the story doesn t end at the barbed wire and that fact alone keeps me glued to the end
this is an odysessy through time via computer animation supposedly th work of over artists made in the late s and released in this was cutting edge stuff for the day i thought it was good and quite interesting in spots most of the short scenes made no sense just forms evolving into other forms but that was fun to watch this is all about visuals not really about any kind of a story there were some strange sequences in which odd looking men creatures would dance around with birds overheard all of it is computer animated which was new back then even the term computer animated was not well known it s simply a chance to show off this new technology in short bits of cartoon like happenings with beautiful colors and imaginative scenes no words just pictures with electronic music stoners must have really loved this it s a nice intriguing minutes of eye candy and head candy by today s cg effects this may have lost impact but i think you d still be entertained by this
many of the reviews and comments i have read about this movie say that this is a rather stale film and performance by clara bow although the story line was rather typical of clara s later silents i still find it somewhat heart stirring and incredibly fun clara plays a happy go lucky hawaiian girl who will stop at nothing to win the man she loves never mind that this man is married clara s lack of modesty was shocking in the day but i believe it lends to the sweetness and general fun of the movie though definitely not a brilliant story line quite typical actually this movie is a nice showcase of clara s ability to make the audience laugh
nicely done and along with new voyages it s a great continuation fab to see james cawley in the latest episode vigil check it out i like the growing characterisation and think we have good replacements for the tv actors in a fan produced piece this show manages to capture the feel quite well as they state on the ste it has improved over the years with experience and i hope with some more experience a strong script editor and a pick up in timing and cgi that hf will becoming more remarkable than it already truly is good work to all concerned i have a huge soft spot for lefler mcfarland great acting although i m a bit tired of lefler s laws enough already shelby s great if a little uptight and it s cool she got the ship commodore ian s nice like fred flintstone but lacks the gritty edge of a commanding officer and does seem too pleased with himself the doc counselor and rawlins are right on the money in my eyes as is the wonderful nechayev what a beautiful accent a real russian well i m guessing rene hails from the czech rep it gets my vote and the cgi is kewl some of the greenscreen s obvious but on a small budget whaddayagonndo really glad i found it ok some of the acting isn t great but it s fan made and is therefore allowed to be variable sorry cmm cole the gay material is layed on too thick graham norton d be embarrassed trek doesn t pay that much attention to hetero couples so why signpost gays with all the snogging it s not necessary to showpiece someone s sexuality to this extent i hope they tone it down let aster zen be people not tokens i don t treat my gay friends any differently they re just regular guys musically it s a mixed bag i can tell its all stock trek ost stuff and works most of the time but timing can fall flat now then the end of worst fears part misses the crunch and the edit love the fact they use the galaxy quest music i certainly can t wait for more dazza never give up never surender viva les frontieres
michigan edgar allen poe a toaster and a frying pan if you don t mind the psycho thriller or horror film genre and you have a special place in your heart for the twisted this is the movie for you an amazingly well developed first film hatred of a minute has all the draw of mainstream hits like silence of the lambs and of cult classics like army of darkness the editing and effects are well done better than many films in the genre kallio weaves an intricate tale of torment drawing on both the bible and poe s writings at a time when big budget big name films lack much in the way of substance the independent film has resurrected this dying trait if you love michigan a good story or a decent thriller go check out hatred of a minute
a hot headed cop accidentally kills a murder suspect and then covers up the crime but must deal with a guilty conscience while he tries to solve a murder case andrews and tierney are reunited with director preminger in a film noir that is as effective as laura their earlier collaboration andrews is perfectly cast as the earnest cop a good guy caught up in unfortunate circumstances the acting is fine all around including malden as a tough police captain and tully as tierney s protective father the screenplay by hecht a great and prolific screenwriter is taut and suspenseful and preminger creates a great atmosphere
hitler the rise of evil is clearly produced by people emotionally unburdened by the horrors of world war which makes watching a refreshing experience i think its greatest value lies in its crystal clear revealing of the nazi mechanism of the utterly corrupt ways hitler used to make it to the top having arrived there this film ends when on top the fuhrer german for leader led his germany to the biggest most devastating war in history of mankind ending six years later in germany s utter defeat as a result germany lost its eastern provinces about of its prewar soil and was forced to accept a year split of its remaining territory both west and east germany had to be rebuilt from scrap their reputations severely damaged by the many nazi atrocities inspired by racism as i said hitler the rise of evil makes an good watch set in an acceptable thirties environment with more than competent acting in particular peter o toole s role as the aged president von hindenburg stands out even adds an extra dimension my copy of hitler the rise of evil also provides a second dvd with two good documentary films one is about hitler s personality the second deals with the forgery of the hitler diaries in this forgery caused a hilarious scandal in england and germany damaging the reputations of several historians and journalists
since i first saw this in the theater it has been my favorite since then i ve seen it countless times and i never get tired of it the setting has a lot to do with it the colorado i know would be jealous but the storyline is original and i liked how it used small town mountain folk as the heroes there has not been a movie i can compare this too john lithgow plays a smart villain but i love how he is completely out of his element he has to follow tucker around and that s what keeps it interesting this is an action movie at it s best i don t think i ll see another that is so entertaining you don t need rounds fired to qualify as an action movie it just has to keep you captivated not shell shocked
when i was very young on a local tv station they would show kung fu movies of all kinds on saturdays i saw lots of kung fu movies on weekends i remember lots of them i saw great flicks like crippled masters blind fist of bruce kung fu zombie shaolin drunken monk rage of the master tattoe dragon and five deadly venoms i remember the day clearly me and my dad had just gotten lunch at burger king we were racing home to see what movie it would be this saturday we ran in the house and jumped onto the couch turned on the set and flicked it onto the usual intro of many kung fu movie clips in the background with the words kung fu saturday over it then under that was the title of the film it said five deadly venoms then the movie began i bit into my burger amused with the pre credit sequence i loved this movie the minute it came on my favorite character was the toad venom the plot was hard to follow at that age but that wasn t what lured me it was the fighting the fights were so amazing i moaned every time a commercial came on and soon the hours of the best movie i have ever seen ended
this series produced at probably the most propitious time following the events of the second world war is on a scale of value that stands far above any individual s presumption to criticize the timing of world at war s production in amounting to some three decades after the events of the war permits an accurate relating of events in a manner uncoloured by residual propaganda and slant the passage of thirty years allows the telling to be backed up by an impressive and fascinating panoply of the very individuals involved ranging from some of the highest military and political figures down to the field soldiers civilians and such survivors of the death camps as have remained to bear witness to the unimaginable inhumanities of which civilized humans are capable most approaching or well into their senior years the interviewed subjects have had enough time to reflect on their experiences and in most instances have had enough time for whatever propaganda and fervor may have affected them in the past to have receded away leaving only the memories of what they saw and what they did the information that these survivors give strikingly reinforced by the postures and expressions they display while telling their part give their stories all the more impact such names as ira eaker adolph galland louis mountbatten albert speer gertrude junge hitler s personal secretary the list is far too long to relate today within the lifetime of the survivors of this enormous lesson in the hideous price of political ambition are young people who chant the same sort of militaristic and nationalistic war promotion as led to ww the dvd series we discuss here ought to comprise the core of a mandatory history subject in schools that the lessons bought at such a horrible cost in those days should not have been wasted but should be taken to heart by those who did not see firsthand the terrible price i am almost done watching the disk set having seen most of the series when a local tv channel aired it more than years ago it has lost none of its poignancy to me indeed has become even more of a magnificent chronicle of some of the very darkest days of human times the highest possible rating seems unworthy of being applied to this presentation i think the value of this series is beyond counting
anchors aweigh is the product of the classic mgm musical production unit and on the whole the film is every enjoyable good music by jule styne and others excellent dancing by gene kelly and even a passable job by frank sinatra and a funny well paced script the only major element i would criticize would be the casting of kathryn grayson whose presence in a film always means the audience will be subjected to endless pseudo operatic warbling from the petite miss kelly plays a naval serviceman named joseph brady a man with a mythic reputation around the ship as a lover but whose valentino charms are constantly being subdued by the presence of his less cocksure friend with the improbable middle american name of clarence sinatra upon receiving days of shore leave for saving clarence s life joe reluctantly agrees to help clarence find a girl based on the dubious premise that he owes him something for saving his life they are drafted by a policeman rags ragland who needs them to help coax a precocious young boy dean stockwell who wants to join the navy into returning home to aunt susan grayson at first it is clarence who is interested in wooing aunt susan but eventually kelly s character emerges as the more likely candidate there are several standout musical scenes but nothing to come close to kelly s more famous work in films like singin in the rain and american in paris the closest we get is a gimmicky sequence with kelly s character in a fantasy sequence dancing with jerry the mouse from tom and jerry although he seems to be closer in size to a dog or cat here than to a mouse it s a startling sequence for its time but doesn t have enough complexity or emotion to really stand the test of time i actually enjoyed the parts of the sequence that took place prior to the animation where kelly was using semi balletic moves to emphasize the transition into the fantasy world and where we see him dance down a tunnel that looks like something right out of alice in wonderland eventually the characters find their way to susan s favorite bar a somewhat sanitized mexican restaurant bar in tijuana there the patrons happily allow ms grayson to chirp her arias with abandon and the management becomes very excited at the opportunity that clarence and joe have extended for her to sing with their friend jose iturbi playing himself with a light humorous touch of course they ve never met their friend iturbi and they spend much of the film s length trying to reach him in an amusing scene sinatra s character meets iturbi but mistakes him for a piano tuner and urges him to abandon tuning pianos and try a professional career sneaking into the studio and the hollywood bowl where iturbi is rehearsing a surreal symphony comprised of dozens of young piano players you haven t seen anything like this outside of fingers of dr t iturbi himself is a kind of a god figure in the story he represents the opportunity for salvation from the drudgery of unfulfilling work and the possibility for fame and artistic achievement for the heroine everyone is sure that as soon as mr iturbi so much as hears ms grayson her operatic career will be a reality the primary characters are desperate to reach him and they think of him as some kind of remote and distant mythological figure a lot of the film s charm and humor comes from the contrast of this perception to the very down to earth real mannerisms of the maestro and speaking of iturbi s contributions to the film he also provides a very stimulating musical moment with his orchestral interpretation of donkey serenade when all is said and done this is a film that nobody who enjoys musicals will want to miss the majority of the music was written for this film a nice contrast to recycled soundtracks for other kelly opuses like rain and american kelly is still at his early peak adventurous and boisterous in both his dances and his interpretation of the character sinatra s voice was never in better form and he rarely had better songs to sing stockwell is a charming addition to the clan and grayson s character is endearing when she isn t posturing on stage iturbi adds that well grounded but sophisticated tone that perfectly matches the atmosphere and style of the classic era mgm musical this is one of the better ones
this movie is horrible in a so bad it s good kind of way the storyline is rehashed from so many other films of this kind that i m not going to even bother describing it it s a sword sorcery picture has a kid hoping to realize how important he is in this world has a nomadic adventurer an evil aide sorcerer a princess a hairy creature you get the point the first time i caught this movie was during a very harsh winter i don t know why i decided to continue watching it for an extra five minutes before turning the channel but when i caught site of gulfax i decided to stay and watch it until the end gulfax is a white furry creature akin to chewbacca but not nearly as useful or entertaining to watch he looks like someone glued a bunch of white shag carpeting together and forced the actor to wear it there are scenes where it looks like the actor cannot move within or that he s almost falling over although he isn t in the movie that much the few scenes are worth it watch as he attempts to talk smack to bo svenson taking the solo chewbacca comparison s to an even higher level i actually bought this movie just because of that character and still have it somewhere gulfax may look like sh t but he made this movie the only reason i ve never seen the sequel or even sought it out was because of his absence perhaps should there be a final film completing the trilogy gulfax will make a much anticipated return
a typical romp through cheech and chong s reality which includes drugs singing more drugs cars and driving even more drugs pee wee aliens gasoline laundry stand up comedy surprisingly more drugs and space coke it is not as coherent or plausible as up in smoke but it still is incredibly funny without becoming as strange as nice dreams there are some classic scenes which include the opening scene where they get some gas for their car and the drive to work also funny is cheech s song mexican americans and chong s follow up song another notable scene is the welfare office scene with jones human noise machine from the police academy series and the old laughing man all in all this is a great follow up to up in smoke and is quite watchable when sober or not celluloid rehab
i must admit i am a big fan of south park and was expecting basketball to be funny but nowhere near as good as it turned out to be i think this is what happens when you mix david zucker matt stone and trey parker together this movie has so much replay value and at no point bothers to take itself seriously the slap stick style humor mixed with stone and parker just works flawlessly the kind of humor present in basketball was not popular upon the time of it s release and had it come out today it would be a hit don t bother trying to be critical just leave your brain at the door and expect endless laughs to come recommended to anyone with a good sense of humor
imdb lists this as for some reason but the other sources i ve seen including the excellent program notes mark it as doesn t really matter except that it s quite interesting to watch this abstract collage of film and video one of the first art works to merge the two apparently in the context of the star gate sequence in released the same year pure abstraction isn t really my thing but i can take it in small doses and the super saturated optically printed colors and psychedelic feel of this series of flowers rohrschach blots birds etc is pretty compelling and quite beautiful certainly helped paved the way for many other nascent video artists in the s and deserves to be better known
joshua seftel s first film a satire of memorable proportions is about just as the title suggests the corporations effect on war the film is about a mercenary john cusack traveling to turaqistan not a real country fyi to help the american government get their message across to turaqistan s leaders he meets a reporter marisa tomei and we all know what will ensue with a lonely man a hot reporter somewhere in the mix a pop star named yonica babyyeah gets thrown in as yonica is marrying one of turaquistan s most important people a son of the president a subplot is created where the mercenary must watch over this star well somewhat the film starts off with a lonely cusack in a bar no more than fifteen seconds later the film hooks you with it s amusing and intriguing insight on terrorism and politics the film s running time blows by you the film has a lot more action than i expected with the occasional scene of war well choreographed fights and just sporadic scenes of murder though the story isn t much deep the simplicity of it all makes the film perfect for both the common man and movie critics alike in the final act of the film the simplicity of it all turns very hostile and jumbled i thought it was executed very well but other may disagree and i could understand why twist after twist is what the ending is all about and like most films it is a true hit miss situation regardless the three writers on the film mark leyner jeremy pikser john cusack did a fantastic job creating a realistic and entertaining satire on today s situation overseas joshua seftel does an excellent job insuring the film s integrity not reducing the material to the most redundant of films which i was afraid would happen seftel crafted the film as perfectly as one could he created a vibrant atmosphere one that is both examines harsh reality and cartoonish falsities contrasting them perfectly as well as making the film feel as if you were watching it all seftel really gets you involved in all of the action and it pays off completely no missteps here hopefully he takes on more directorial jobs for he is one director to look out for
for long time i haven t seen such a good fantasy movie magic fights here are even better than in lotr even considering that it s a movie and haven t computer special effects this movie have good plot good acting and interesting ideas recommend everybody to see it
i first saw this film when it was transmitted around by the bbc when i was working on uk s ad my pal steve parkhouse recorded it on vhs and sent it to me up till this point i d really only seen the shaw bros kung fu movies with their harsh lighting so audience could see the moves clearly so it was a revelation to me to see something that looked like it had been lit by ridley scott coming out of hong kong this was also my first exposure to the movies of tsui hark pronounced apparently choy huk yet for all the smoky back lit exteriors and ambitious special effects stop motion in a hong kong movie at the heart of chinese ghost story lies a simple and moving love story made all the more real by the outstanding acting talent of leslie cheung what a tragic tragic waste of a life and the beauty and elegance of joey wong granted joey is gorgeous but it s her balletic hand gestures that give her character an unattainable eroticism that s hard to analyse and though joey is now almost years older gawd which of us isn t this will always be the enduring image of that actress some reviewers here have said that the film is simplistic and lacks any surprises but they re missing the fact that this movie was based on a famous chinese story written by pu songling around that s a bit like complaining that romeo and juliet has a predictable ending and just copies west side story just wanted to get that off my chest for me chinese ghost story is the quintessential romantic tale it has high tragedy because we know that chio sin and sin seen can never be together it s about becoming mature for none of us can mature until we ve experienced great loss it s about sacrifice for sacrifice is an essential component of true love and the comedy stylings of wu ma don t hurt a bit either enjoy chinese ghost story by trying not to view it through a filter of western culture and you ll get on with it just fine
i never had an inkling while watching the movie that it was meant for the idiot box i always thought that this was some very good successful movie of the late s but after i saw on the internet that this was meant for the tv i was shocked because for a television film it is absolutely fantastic the thing that mostly concerned me was the length i felt that the one on one battle scene should ve been removed as it was completely unnecessary also it began to drag towards the end as it seemed as if the adventure was never going to end on the plus side there is a strong very interesting and captivating plot with magnificent performances by everyone i just felt that patrik frayze looked a bit haggard i also felt that gogool who looked dementing turned a bit stupid at some scenes i was delighted by the beautiful landscapes of africa also the first half of the movie would have made me give this movie a still its a great film for the television out of
the industry dropped the ball on this the trailer does not do the movie justice and when this opened it was on a hand full of screens had people had an opportunity to see this work of mouth would have made it very successful the lead actresses each give great emotional performances that really draw you in to the story and especially the characters i checked this out based on the rave recommendation richard roeper or ebert and roeper in his book an example of a great film that never got fully released except on a few screens which gave it no chance to be seen some movies go to video quickly because they aren t that good this is oscar worthy and it s a tragedy on many levels that most will never even hear of it maybe via word of mouth it will gain a following on dvd or cable if you haven t see this movie you should great performances of the lead actresses make this movie it could have just been another formulaic teen movie after school special but instead it stands up well to other note worthy films girl interrupted comes to mind if you like that you will like this both girls are in one amazing emotional scene after another without coming off as melodramatic even though alicia is angry and deanna is crying through most of the movie it is done is such a real way that they do not come off as stereotypical characters or as melodramatic the movie will move you in many scenes and if you are an aspiring actor use these real performances as your school erica is even better in this than in traffic i hope both of these actors get more roles that utilize their talents as well and let them shine see this movie and if you like recommend to friends so it doesn t get lost among all the blockbuster crap that comes out every year this movie was buried while spiderman tops records what kind of word are we living in aghhh so to make the world right again see this and recommend it
i caught this movie on the sundance channel on cable one late afternoon you might say who loves the sun is a perfect leisurely pastime of a story why ever not you get to hang out with the trio lukas haas is will returning after abruptly leaving everyone years ago molly parker is maggie we learn she s very much part of the family bloom and adam scott is daniel is he friend or foe or fianc by the scenic falcon lake manitoba canada captured in graphic compositions juxtaposed in vivid summer colors against sunshine and shadows and supporting the trio are two more family members in the revealing mix wendy crewson is mom mary bloom and r h thomson is dad arthur bloom writer director matt bissonnette has delivered an ingenious unfolding of story line and its various tentacle links worry not haas may have a listless face but humor will come as parker and scott enter the circle of friends reunited wry smiles will break and knowing delights stir dialogs may be terse or even nil yet we d get the flavor of what s cooking bemused or wondering yes who loves the sun can very well be categorized as a sleeper gem the chemistry between all five principals sure gels and combusts giving an energetic ensemble performance after all it s all in the family and the film sure doesn t take itself too seriously looks like the official site is still available at wholovesthesun com and there are information on the soundtrack by mac mccaughan portastatic with guitar tunes and strings where score excerpts are being played and behind the scenes production notes interview with writer director producer bissonnette on how the movie and concept came about the casting and more have always appreciate molly parker since her spare yet mesmerizing performance in lynne stopkewich s kissed and she s married to bissonnette who wrote the maggie part for molly
i d heard of eddie izzard but had never seen him in action i knew he was a transvestite and when i saw he was on hbo one night last summer i put it on not knowing how my husband would react well he blew us away he s better than robin williams ever was he has total control of the audience when he does the englebert is dead no he s not routine the audience doesn t know what to think by the end god as james mason is also an inspired touch and his version of the python spanish inquisition as carried out by the church of england cake or death is priceless my jaws were aching from laughter by the end of the show we scoured the tv listings for months after that to be able to see him again and were lucky enough to tape him the next time he came on if you get the chance to see this show cancel everything and tape it you won t be disappointed
and possibly closest to the dickens story line although i find the young ebenezer hard to watch who s idea was that period hair surely they could have done better than that scott does an incredible job as scrooge his delivery of some of the lines from dickens finally brought it to life for me edward woodward is everything we expect and more of the ghost of christmas present i find g c scott s scrooge much more of a believable miser than the more current version done by patrick stewart the scene christmas morning when scrooge realizes he hasn t missed it is enough to convince one that scott knows how to act versus overact he s phenomenal here nearly the entire cast is incredible the tiny tim in this version of the christmas carol is a little tough to look at almost too sweet still the music and the scenery make this a must watch every holiday enjoy
if you delete the first twenty minutes or so of this film you will be left with a fantastic comedy as it is i still found it to be a pretty good movie which is no small feat considering the coma i was put in by the opening scenes to put it mildly this film has a dreary beginning that wasn t even remotely funny or even upbeat once things get sillier however you are left with a comedy that still holds up well after more than three decades definitely worth checking out especially if you re a younger fan of lemmon and matthau who wants to see their earlier work
i had heard good things about this film and was you guessed it a bit disappointed reese witherspoon is as promised surprisingly good surprisingly confident at a young age really all the small cast are quite solid in their simple s american setting the reason i didn t rate this film higher is mainly that towards the end the grief shown by the older sister didn t seem so real and this pulled me out of the film a bit perhaps we are expected to fill in the plot or perhaps the film needed to be a bit longer maureen s character is quite underdeveloped i think it is understandable that dani reese w the younger would be traumatised and angry but why is her sister shown to be more upset because she s a few years older hasn t the end rather undermined the rest of the film the pacing of the movie makes it seem that maureen and court have only just met when he gets tractored warning this scene is surprisingly brutal in retrospect it seems like it might have been trying to shock a bit well it works it depends what you want if you want the girls happy story of young love that it seems like you re going to get you re in for a surprise man in the moon is both quaint and dreamy and a harsh coming of age film a rather awkward combination i liked the character of court though i can see what girls watching this might be watching and i loved that they had the courage to both let him hurt the younger sister most men would most films wouldn t and get killed on my pretty harsh ratings scale for some reason i found jason london on a tractor funny
this movie and yes it s a movie it was shot as a two parter but the two parts together come down to slightly more than hours is one of the unsung masterpieces of world cinema a very well mannered and yet at the same time absolutely savage denunciation of the soviet regime and the type of person who flourished under it the film is a faithful adaptation of the long banned eponymous book by mikhail bulgakov the sets are flawless and the director made the brilliant decision to film in monochrome sepia adding a feel of authenticity where a late s washed out color incarnation would have all but ruined the film i won t say much about the plot which deserves to be discovered by the viewer himself but the performances are true oscar material special mentions go out to e evstigneev who plays the old professor with such presence gravitas and kind wisdom that with barely a word or a gesture he ends up stealing every scene he s in the second of course is creature sharikov who played to horrifying perfection by v tolokonnikov is by far more frightening a character than hannibal lecter because not only does he exist in real life entire countries have been ran by men like him throughout history with all that ensues while it s a socio political allegory it is worth mentioning that the movie is also brimming with humor albeit dark there are many outright comedies which haven t made me laugh as much as this film what s more when laughing at this movie the feeling is not only one of hilarity but of understanding and agreement which is always a plus there is hardly a complaint i have with this movie the only slight flaw is the tone of intellectual bourgeois snobbery i caught at times from the enlightened characters but that s a minor quibble sadly this film appears to have been bypassed by western licensing companies it s a crying shame that one of the all round best movies out there is languishing unrestored and untranslated which shouldn t be incredibly hard though all the cultural references and the revolutionary terminology will necessarily fade in translation the film s main themes should be accessible to all while we re waiting with our fingers crossed for the criterion edition i m considering creating english subtitles myself will see how that works out
probably the best picture producers releasing corp ever made this little horror piece rivets the attention from first to last director frank wisbar obviously knows a good story when he writes one and what s more important he knows how to realize its full shock potential on the screen not only is the plot involving and the characters fascinatingly drawn but the setting is absolutely out of this world just about all the action takes place either at night or in the middle of a clinging pervasive fog this chilling atmosphere is augmented by wisbar s inventive direction and the wholly convincing performances he has drawn from all his players the lovely rosemary la planche makes an ideal heroine beautiful spirited yet vulnerable robert barrat delivers his usual no nonsense straight down the line portrait of the local bigwig though it s hard to believe that the personable good looking guy who plays his son is none other than the later dullsville writer director blake edwards
this is the best movie i ve come across in a long while not only is this the best movie of its kind school shooting the way ben coccio the director decided to film it was magnificent he filmed it using teenage actors who were still attending high school he filmed it in the actors own rooms and used the actors real parents as their parents in the film also the actors were filming too using camcorders making it seem much more like a video diary it is almost artful if that is indeed a word there are a few slip ups however for example when cal calls brads land rover a range rover or vice versa it s been awhile since i ve seen it
i saw this movie at an advance screening and found it excellent new york i love you is a true spin on a romance that explores clever funny and sometimes shocking situations around the human race s most powerful emotion the cast is huge a veritable oceans with andy garcia ethan hawke shia labouf natalie portman bradley cooper and others they all give stand out performances in one way or another that s not to mention that there is a who s who of directors interweaving stories in clever and interesting ways brett rattner shaka kapur natalie portman i mean wow this movie is not a straight ahead romance or romantic comedy even though it is both romantic and funny it also has serious stories and notes but that s good in my opinion go see it for yourself and reply to my review i want to hear what others have to say
i watched this on an hour flight and presumably because of the pressure and the altitude i actually found it mildly entertaining emphasis on the mild the actual idea behind the film was brilliant a woman dies her fianc falls in love with someone else she decided to make sure they don t get together but eventually she lets them do it sadly the actual film wasn t as good ok there were a few laughs and the actors all worked well but from the beginning the plot was about as predictable as the destination of the flight i was on i think the whole gay but not gay friend part of the story could have been worked a lot better the talking parrot was a nice idea but to be honest it wasn t really very funny in summary the film was more interesting than staring at the seat in front of me but it was a close call
this is a better than average silent movie and it s still well worth seeing if you are a fan of the silents however if you aren t yet a fan of the genre i suggest you try a few other films before watching this one that s because the plot just seems pretty old fashioned and difficult to believe in spots but despite this it s still a good film and kept my interest a nice lady unfortunately hooked up with the wrong man and ran away to marry him the film starts five years later after she has come to realize that he is really a brutal thief despite this she tries to make the best of it and not dwell on how good life had been before this jerk came into her life however the rent is due and there s no money so the lady is forced to look for work she becomes a personal seamstress for a rich lady whose husband is trying to swing a business deal unfortunately the lady who they were trying to hook up a potential client with for a dinner party can t make it and the seamstress is paid handsomely to be the man s date well like cinderella she cleans up pretty well and the man is infatuated with her what to do now given that she is actually married and the new fella wants to marry her well see the movie yourself to see how it s all resolved i didn t like how they handled the husband as it seemed awfully predictable and clich d however once he was out of the way i do admire how the film also didn t give up a by the numbers finale and left the film with a few loose ends all in all a very good film worth seeing but certainly not great
this show is awesome i thought that the two episodes where paul died were so sad i actually cried but the other shows were awesome kerry was my favorite character because she was in the dark side i also thought that bridget was funny because she was all perky i also thought that guy who played kyle was really really cute i loved it when kerry made sarcastic remarks about everything the guy who played rory was cute and paul played by john ritter was really funny this whole entire tv show is funny and i wish they still showed it on tv when they did show it on tv though i watched it every single time it was on the next time it shows i will watch it over and over again
prince stars as the kid in this semi autobiographical film of a talented but narcissistic young musician who has a less then stellar home life true the acting leaves a tad to be desired barring morris day and especially clarence williams who are both pitch perfect but the movie is still great and among the best to come out of the s it has the best soundtrack of any movie of the last years at least highly quotable lines and the dumpster scene is hilarious plus apollonia is just simply stunning on an unrelated not when i saw prince in concert in he blew down the stadium he is an expert showman and it was one of the best concerts that i ve experienced my grade a dvd extras disc commentary with director albert magnoli producer robert cavallo director of photography donald thorin theatrical trailer trailers for under the cherry moon and grafitti bridge disc a minute featurette on the first avenue club purple rain bachstage pass a half hour featurette on the movie which i ll review later on it s page riffs raffs and revolution the impact and influence of purple rain minute featurette minutes of mtv s premiere footage when mtv didn t suck donkey balls prince music videos let s go crazy take me with you when doves cry i would die u baby i m a star and purple rain videos by the time jungle love and the bird and a music video for sex shooter by apollonia eye candy apollonia shows her fine ass titties
i really can t say too much more about the plot of the movie that hasn t already been said i haven t seen the movie in about years and the memory of it has never left me i have been searching for it every where i have done net searches for it in the past but came up empty last night i was thinking about the movie again and was trying to remember who was in it but i was only about or when i last saw it and i wasn t even sure if i had the right movie name so i decided to do another search and i finally found this sight i was right if any one knows where i can get a copy of this wonderful movie to share with my family could you please let me now at tawnyteel yahoo com i would really appreciate it and to anyone who has not seen this movie and has the chance to it is well worth it

includes spoilers i ve been a horror film fan now for many decades just when i think i ve seen all the great ones another pops up to surprise me i had never seen this film before it was a treat off the beaten path too not just the path to the swamp ferry boat either here was a horror film made in the s that dared to try something very different the pretty girl is gulp fearless for a change and saves the men including the man she loves from the monster how is that for a twist this girl was the complete opposite of most women in films of that time no screaming at her own shadow no fainting from fright no tripping over a leaf as she runs this gal wasn t afraid to live alone in a secluded hut far away from the rest of the villagers not only that but the place was on a foggy swamp rumored to be haunted heck she even takes naps on the swamp grass outdoors like a regular s version of ripley no snake gator or ghostly strangler would dare bother this gal books on early feminist films should be sure to include this overlooked work see this if you are a fan like me of those wonderfully atmospheric classic b w horror films they made only in the s and s and be sure to wear your cast iron turtle neck for protection
despite what others had said cough this is my favourite movie of all time i don t know how long i had been waiting to see it but once i finally did i immediately fell in love sure it s strange but that just gives it more of an exciting flavour for those who don t know moonchild is one of gackt and hyde s first movies they haven t done very many at all maybe or tops each so give them some credit we all know that adam sandler wasn t the best at first either i do believe that they do throw some odd situations in there but i over look that to find the best points of this movie the emotions displayed and whatnot therefore i have given and always shall give this movie a out of
the neil simon s sunshine boys starring walter matthau and george burns is a funny comedy on the strange bond to the life and its shortness but the laughter always bitter taste seeing willy clark matthau and al lewis burns two big theatrical comedy actors now reduced on the imbecility from the hard and unceasing old age you can feel only anger and blue willy not ever surrender and continue to look work while al is tired for players and he is retired to the country in the house to his daughter the couple in his old time was truly funny and harmony but out the scene was a continue squabble and to quarrel and for eleven years after their broken they not talk between now if they would work they must return together another time for do one of his best old sketch for a comedy story tv show the meets is explosive and liberating for the old questions the neil simon s screenplay give a certain corrosive spirit to the story and the melancholy and blue overwhelming the many gags and laughter succeeded to generate a good mix also thanks to a great couple walter matthu nomination academy award as best actor and george burns won the academy award as best support actor the two actors are very believable and real and the their harmony seems almost as they real work together for all that time and that realty they not bear between them the movie is very touching also for its all consuming reality as the story is narrate and how the report love heat that bind the two actors is totally real part to the strange but at the same time ordinarily comprehensible things to the life my rate is
the ladies man is laugh out loud funny with a great diverse cast as well as having some very stupid but excellent scenes including the funniest love song ever written ferrell is his usual quality self in a brilliant side role tim meadows plays an idiot surprisingly well and has written himself some of the funniest lines you ll find in any comedy out there it is definitely worth a purchase as watching it every months or so will lead to you still laughing as hard as you did first time round i am distraught to think at the time of writing this that it has a meagre and i urge you to vote and remember kids theres more motion in the ocean
well done giving the perspective of the other side fraulein doktor captures both the cost and the futility of war excellent acting especially when german high command refuses in the name of chivalry to present medal kaiser ordered struck the scenes of carnage are probably too intense for effete us minds who d probably prefer some silly speeches and senseless abstractions like points or the league of nations real americans might appreciate the story line and the action for all the action and intrigue fraulein doktor compares favo u rably to jacob s ladder
it is not an easy film to watch it is over three and a half hours long and it is composed entirely of conversations yet it is so incredibly compelling and ruthlessly observational of the human character that it is in my humble opinion one of the very greatest films of all time the film is depressing cynical and cruel if you want something uplifting see jacques rivette s fantastic c line and julie go boating which was made around the same time it shows the idealism of the late s to be nothing different from the society that it was trying to change it involves a supposedly liberated m nage trois between alexandre played by jean pierre leaud marie bernadette lafont and veronika francoise lebrun yet alexandre is shown to be as chauvinistic and jealous as any other man the women are exposed as being willingly subservient and defining their femininity through the male gaze the film is an extremely icy end to the highly revolutionary french new wave this movement was one of the most significant movements in film history and had a profound effect on cinema as we know it jean pierre leaud was one of the key actors of the new wave having starred among other films in the influential les quatres cent coups by francois truffaut as a rebellious teenager director jean eustache is not as well known as other directors from the new wave but he should be there is no improvisation unlike in john cassavetes s similar films made in the us and the dialogue comes from real life conversations the film is resonant with eustache s personal experiences for example francoise lebrun was a former lover of eustache eustache himself committed suicide in and the real life person that the character marie was based on did too the anger and bitterness all culminate in a harrowing monologue by veronika delivered directly to the audience breaking down the coldly objective nature of the rest of the film this mesmerising personal and honest filmic statement remains one of the most revealing films of human nature around
i think that this film was one of kurt russels good movies kurt russel is my favorite actor so i think that he is a good actor in any role he plays but this movie had a lot of action in it and i know that it should have more then a out of on the meter but many people did not like this movie oh well i thought it was good so i think that every one should see this movie if you see this movie and like it i think that you should see back draft also with kurt russel i give soldier out of
this is a more interesting than usual porn movie because it is a fantasy adventure the production values are high and the acting is believe it or not pretty good especially jenna jameson it s also in widescreen which helps it gives a feeling of a real motion picture and not a porn movie but of course it is a porn and a really good one with nice costumes fine atmosphere and scenery and by the way the sex is hot watch out for this one
when i first saw the title i was already deducing the theme of the film it clearly wasn t a reference to british currency so it had to be shakespearian and about pounds of flesh taking them or giving them will smith s a feelgood actor so serial killers were out it could only be about a man giving them so must be about guilt somehow i spoilt the whole thing for myself by looking it up and knowing the story before i watched as the beauty of the build up is the way parts of the main character s background are drip fed to slowly illuminate the audience as to who he is and why he is doing what he is doing guilt is a very hard subject to do simply because it s deeply uncomfortable and sad which is not an encouraging premise when you are hoping for a roller coaster ride you know its going to be unpleasant i wouldn t say the movie glorifies suicide it delves into the most extreme form of self sacrifice martyrdom it s also brimming with symbolism everywhere which is a surefire tell tale sign that the writing is cleverly thought out in great detail and driving at multiple meanings and a deep reflective nature the most prominent theme that struck me was that he was not only giving his heart to the girl he loves emotionally and metaphorically but was giving it to her physically as the greatest gift he could determined to die but his plan is thwarted by falling in love what a nd act complication absolutely masterful yes it is very slow paced but i m undecided as to whether it would have been better slotted into a smaller timeframe i didn t feel the strain and his terrible inner turmoil as much as i could have but maybe that s just me having ruined it for myself beforehand saying all that though it is a deeply moving and original film that is an incredibly powerful and thought provoking tragedy that deserves the awards it will inevitably get
this is an amazing film to watch or show young people aside from a very brief nude scene it gives an interesting glimpse into colonial rule in africa that you ll rarely find in other films it does bear a superficial similarity to out of africa but without all the romantic fluff the white french people in cameroon are fascinating because they don t even seem to regard the natives as people the whites are all the bosses and they expect black servitude without question however unlike real servants you only once hear any of the whites say thank you and no other regard is given these people again and again it s like they are pets or slaves as the feelings of the people are never even considered the central illustration of this thoughtlessness is the relationship between the mother aim e and her servant prot e although at times they spend a lot of time together and it is only normal that they might begin to have sexual feelings towards each other the white woman never considers prot e or the existence of his feelings a good example of this thoughtlessness is when she has prot e lace up her dress and it s obvious that he is very sexually frustrated by this apart from this relationship while almost all the whites are completely oblivious to the fact that the africans are people a few go so far as to verbally abuse and treat them like garbage also interesting is the relationship between prot e and the little girl who is the one who is grown at the beginning and end of the film while they are very close at times he s more like a plaything or pet and the girl never plays with native children there is one bizarre white character who seems at times to regard the blacks better but unfortunately his character is very inconsistent and confusing one moment he s doing hard work along side the blacks or eating with them something the other whites would never have done and the next he s trying to beat up prot e i could only guess as to what motivated him perhaps he was just a jerk or was crazy or perhaps was a communist agitator trying to stir up the blacks against the whites who knows in fact other than a few good scenes this character seems pretty much wasted while i really enjoyed the insight this movie gave i wish it had instead been more than just a few snippets of this world through the perspective of a child during one small period of her life the context and what happened to rid the country of colonialism is never addressed and the film left me wanting more the film appeared to begin in the early s since she s wearing a walkman style headset and when the film went back in time it seems that it was set about more or less but there was never any mention of the s anti colonialism violence or independence for the nation in the early s i am guessing that some of this confusion might be that the makers of the film screwed up and should have made the beginning of the film earlier such as the s and had the lady think back to her life there in the early s before the country experienced political change apart from the missing context and a confusion over time periods using the prologue and epilogue that showed her as an adult traveling the country was a good idea and i also appreciated the ending as it was a pleasant surprise when you find out more about the nice man who offers her a ride but overall it just feels like something is missing there just isn t any sort of resolution or message other than showing that colonialism is thoughtless and cruel
this is one of my all time favorite films and while it may move too slowly for some it s well worth seeing a corporate lawyer richard chamberlain is dragged into a case involving city aborigines and this is no ordinary case ok a man has died but it wasn t exactly a normal killing there has also been a greater than average amount of rain lately and the atmosphere of most of the film is somewhat claustrophobic oppressive the aborigines are harboring a secret and refuse to spill the beans this has a lot to do with white men making assumptions about city vs tribal aborigines and of course no abo in the big city would practice tribal ways uh huh chamberlain is having strange dreams and he is somehow the key to what s happening although no matter how many times i ve seen this i can t quite grasp the exact connection this is a very eerie and creepy film and is a fine example of peter weir s ability to create tension out of nothing the ending is a little ambiguous but i take it literally it s the easiest way out and the scariest out of and highly recommended
this is a classic action flick from the s featuring arnold schwarzenegger in one of his most memorable roles set in a futuristic police state where the government controls everything including the television networks one of their most popular tv shows is the running man where convicted felons are hunted down and killed for the entertainment of millions it s set up like a game show where the audience votes for their favorite stalkers trained killers who hunt down and kill the show s unlucky contestants audience members also win prizes for correctly predicting who will be killed by whom and the host is played by none other than family feud s richard dawson who s game show experience makes him well suited for this role when ben richards arnold is falsely accused of mass murder he is forced to play this sadistic game this movie is chock full of classic arnold one liners such as his famous i ll be back right before he enters the arena and he taunts a stalker armed with a flamethrower with how about a light i could go on and on but i don t want to spoil the movie it s funny stuff whether it was intended or not this movie serves as a great parody of today s reality tv craze already there are numerous programs that show people enduring pain and humiliation for the entertainment of viewers and even court cases are televised for their entertainment value running man demonstrates what would happen if reality tv hit rock bottom and it is a scary picture one can only hope that the networks have the common sense not to let it go that far overall this is a fun film i highly recommend it out of
johnny and june carter cash financed this film which is a traditional rendering of the gospel stories the music is great you get a real feel of what the world of jesus looked like i ve been there too and june gets into the part of mary magdalene with a passion cash s narration is good too but the actor who played jesus was miscast there is no edge to the story like cash puts in some of his faith based music because it is uncompelling i doubt we ll see this ever widely distributed again i d love to buy the cd tom paine texas usa
atlantis the lost empire has some of the best smoothest animation and cleverly written dialogue of any disney movie i ve seen and i was convinced of that in the first minutes i especially love don novello s voice work on vincenzo santorini and phil morris as joshua strongbear sweet too bad the whole film seems to move at about double the pace that would be appropriate at least in the first act one important aspect of any disney movie is a satisfying antagonist which atlantis doesn t provide he s average at best halfway through the movie there s a mediocre twist that s all it s a great movie nevertheless everyone should check it out
i ve received this movie from a cousin in norway and had to convert it from norwegian to american format with a copied video comparing this film with the heroes of telemark kampen om tungtvannet the struggle for the heavy water casts the saboteurs themselves playing their respective roles though actors were also cast to play the roles of the saboteurs who have given their lives in norway s struggle for freedom in later campaigns the plot is in four languages norwegian along with french german and english complete with norwegian subtitles impressive during this course of history was what led to the struggle french scientists were interested in obtaining some two hundred kilograms of heavy water from norsk hydro in vemork to take back to france in order to do lab studies on its effectiveness simultaneously the nazis too were interested in obtaining heavy water to build a secret weapon the french were worried that the nazis might take an early lead by invading norway and through secret codes their man carefully eluded nazi spies on his trip to oslo where he received the heavy water and making it back without hindrance he was watched by two spies as he boarded an airliner but they did not see him hop out on the other side where he crossed the tarmac to another plane nearby where his cargo was waiting for him this clever trick worked by using the airliner as a decoy that the nazis later forced down in hamburg however the invasion of norway on the morning of april the nazis took over norsk hydro and it was up to the norwegian underground and british intelligence in london to take action professor leif trondstad volunteered the services of eleven young norwegians the swallow and gunnerside groups who would successfully sabotage the heavy water production in vemork this was shown in detail on how they actually carried out the operation including the sinking of the ferryboat after the nazis abandoned norsk hydro to take the shipment of heavy water on rail cars to berlin the quality of the film was fair though there were many splices in the film i highly recommend this film to anyone interested in world war ii history
atlantis was much better than i had anticipated in some ways it had a better story than come of the other films aimed at a higher age although this film did demand a soid attention span at times it was a great film for all ages i noticed some of the younger audience expected a comedy but got an adventure i think everyone is tired of an endless parade of extreme parodies a lot of these kids have seen nothing but parodies after a short time everyone seemed very intensely watching atlantis
i have watched this movie three times the last time i kept skipping around confusing scenes to find resolution for the plot perhaps the plot is not intended to hang together logically or perhaps these rough spots are in the plot because ann s recall of distant events is rather faulty take the young ann grant claire danes here is a young woman who has attended an unnamed college with the scions of a rich family she must have had help to afford this very expensive education but never seems to have any family ties at all she never seems to have any relatives she can turn to when the consequences of one of her disastrous decisions take effect ann shares an evening of passion with her great love harris arden patrick wilson then when harris comforts lila after the tragic death of her brother buddy ann suddenly finds him repulsive and is disgusted with her own behavior i must have missed something significant here ann s behavior seems totally inexplicable ann abandons her relationship with harris and eventually marries one of the groomsmen at lila s wedding despite ann s rejection of harris she continues to hold deep feelings for him on her deathbed it was obvious from his behavior that harris was deeply smitten with ann and would have gladly married her a scene showing their chance meeting years after lila s wedding showed that harris still had deep feelings for ann the film showed a pattern for ann s romantic relationships she always had a falling out with her men and she rejected them this pattern held with harris and two husbands in contrast lila married a man she did not love and she remained with her husband until he died perhaps lila was able to build a relationship because she refused to let her marriage fail then came the too convenient reappearance of lila ross at ann s bedside apparently ann s nurse was able to extract enough information from ann s last few lucid moments to identify and contact lila none of this communication appeared on the film i kept wondering about the house ann was living in during her final days how did she afford to buy such a house on the meager earnings of her singing career ann always seemed one step ahead of financial disaster while raising her two daughters on another level i enjoyed the film s setting and music immensely the seaside mansion was just so heartbreakingly beautiful claire danes was luminous as the young ann grant she is really quite a talented singer i much prefer her natural brunette to the bottle blonde look she had in the film extras if only those pesky cgi fireflies would go away i could raise the movie a whole point in my vote
this is one of my favorite movies of all time i loved rain man with dustin hoffman and tom cruise this movie is in some ways similar but makes rain man seem artificial shallow unemotional and trivial by comparison
this is the who at their most powerful although before the masterwork who s next which would provide anthems like baba o reily and wont get fooled again this film shows the group in transition from mod rockers to one of the biggest live bands of the s daltrey shows what being a front man is all about entwistle steady as ever moon is great check out the ongoing conversation with the drum tech and see him playing side saddle whilst having a bass drum head replaced townsend even looks like he s enjoying himself occasionally considering they took to the stage at am no one in the crowd was asleep there are not many bands these days could produce a set as tight as this and it is difficult to imagine any of the bands of today producing a concert that in years time will be be enjoyed as much as this one
well it s yet again a film that plays with your sentiments and you come out all soft as opposed to a rocky film but i m a sucker for those so i gave it a good score the acting was very good and there were a lot of feeling the violence is kept to a minimal which makes a change i d have given it a if it were not for the salute at the end all in all a good movie with very good actors
pet semetary the creed family have just moved into the small town of ludlow the family consists of a father louis a mother rachel a brother gage and a daughter ellen they are greeted with kindness by jud crandall jud is and could basically tell you about the entire history of ludlow behind the creed s new house there is a path leading to a pet cemetery spelled pet sematary when ellen wants to go up to see it jud willfully takes the family on a trip that is the start of hell for the creed family when rachel and the kids are gone ellen s cat church dies jud feels that ellen isn t ready for the death of her cat so he suggests louis follow him further up the path past the pet cemetery jud tells louis of this burial ground once used by micmac indians louis buries church without jud s help a couple of days later church returns alive but from hell this movie was one of two horror movies that could actually scare me aside from the exorcist the greatest performance would ever be zelda rachel s sister with spinal meningitis or victor pascow a ghost who tries to help the creeds from making the mistake of bringing back things from the dead the music in this movie plays an extravagant part it is at the same time sad and mysterious it goes along with the movie wonderfully
the only reason i give this movie stars and not is because sinatra is awful and the love interest of kelly s character leaves much to be desired imho do love that dean stockwell quantum leap al is the little boy the dance sequence with jerry mouse is one of the most entertaining and amazing dance sequences i have ever seen tom and jerry is still a personal favorite of mine and my daughter s i m and she s so while the character is less iconic than mickey he is still a favorite of many children and adults today kelly is as always captivating his eyes full of fun and excitement in every movie i have ever seen him in he always steals the show one of the best dancers of the th century it is no wonder paula abdul sampled kelly s moves i would also list gene kelly as one of the most beautiful people of the th century if you were to watch only one part don t miss kelly s dance with jerry mouse you will not be disappointed
stylish moody innovative revenge driven bloodbath also cheesy of course and sporadically very cheesy it reminded me a lot of the big heat because it has the revenge plot set off by the exact same event and the girl comes around to the good guy s side because of the same bad behavior by the bad guy it s sad there s no gloria grahame but so fantastic that it s alain delon and not glenn ford could there be anyone as beautiful as alain going around in a cashmere sweater and trenchcoat yet he s totally tough and icy cool no one nowadays can touch him though someone like jude law could try i guess hard for any girl to look good with him the music was funky and perfect and there were several excellent car chases and those aren t generally my cup of tea especially one willy nilly one in the woods people also met their dooms in creative and bloody fashion for instance in a junkyard cruncher but beyond the cheese the overall atmosphere was affecting and expertly pulled off more creativity excitement and freshness in that forgotten movie than most of what i ve seen lately
a family mother patricia clarkson father jake weber son erik per sullivan go out for a family get together in some remote house in the middle of winter they accidentally hit a deer while driving there this angers some of the locals especially otis john speredakos and things slowly very slowly go wrong i was expecting the worst when i started watching this the bulk of the reviews for this on this site are extremely negative well i disagree first off it s not a horror film the horror doesn t even begin until the closing minutes it plays more like a family drama with horror elements thrown in on that level it s pretty damn good first the bad stuff the pace is way too slow jake weber is a horrible actor way too many false dream sequence scares the wendigo barely figures into the film and the clear view we get of the wendigo at the end is laughable the good stuff pretty good dramatic script clarkson is excellent as the mother some great direction with eerie sound effects which are a little scary a pretty explicit hot sex sequence between clarkson and weber which actually is necessary for the integrity of the plot pretty good acting by sullivan only at the time and speredakos and a completely unexpected tragic ending i think many people are annoyed with this film because it s being pushed as a horror film which it isn t so if you can ignore that i think you might like it i m giving it a
neil simon had a knack for dialog and nowhere is this more evident than the lines he gives walter matthau and jack lemmon as opposite types in the odd couple a mixture of comedy and sadness that depends entirely on the believability of two such mismatched friends sharing an apartment lemmon is neatnik felix ungar bent on suicide after the divorce from his wife and reluctantly agreeing to share an apartment with oscar madison matthau with somewhat disastrous results seems that everything felix says and does drives oscar up the wall and neither one can stand the other s ways with oscar being the messiest male imaginable and felix the exact opposite funniest scene for me was when the giggling pigeon sisters in the apartment above visit them on a dinner date the priceless interaction between lemmon matthau and carole shelley and monica evans is enough to put you in stitches the talented pigeon sisters are the gals who did the voices for the gabble sisters a pair of geese in disney s the aristocats and here their comic timing on top of lemmon s sad story of despair is enough to spin the film into hilarity where it remains much of the time if you re a neil simon fan and have enjoyed other screen treatments of his work this one is not to be missed matthau and lemmon are perfectly cast even though they considered exchanging roles before filming began and of course it s easy to see why it became a top rated tv show later on summing up top simon comedy not to be missed
this is not a bad film it is not wildly funny but it is interesting andentertaining it has a few funny moments cher gives a goodperformance in a role that is very opposite her real life self herperformance alone is worth the watch if this movie had come outtoday it would not have been nominated but by s standards itwas excellent
xizao is the tale about the clash of modern life and ancient traditions and its effects on a family in china da ming quanxiu pu is a businessman who returns home when a letter sent by his brother er ming wu jiang makes him believe that his father liu xu zhu has died he founds that his father is still alive as well as his old neighborhood and his father old business the public bathroom the movie centers around da ming s family and how he has to learn the importance of his father s job something he always had considered an old tradition that had to die soon also the movie explores his relationship with er ming who is mentally challenged and the problems of the small community and how the bathroom is a place that purifies not only their bodies but also their souls the two main themes of the movie the family and the problems of progress are incredibly well handled and the movie never loses the point it is trying to make both themes are very good developed and we get a glimpse of chinese society and customs the director yang zhang tells his tale in a simple way letting the characters characters do the job it is a very simple approach but it fits the movie perfectly and i highly doubt that another style would fit the movie this good zhang has enormous potential as he can tell a story without the aid of visual flare or camera tricks the acting is outstanding in its naturalistic approach everyone acts in a very natural way and it almost looks as if they were real persons being filmed the three lead characters give remarkable performances and wu jiang as er ming surely steals the show even when the movie could had sticked to a patronizing old days were much better message instead it takes an attitude of equilibrium like saying that progress is good and we must move on but we must not forget where we came from and keep an equilibrium between modern life and the traditions of old an awesome and touching film
when i first saw this movie i was with my dad he encouraged me to watch this movie because it was one of his favorites after watching the movie it instantly became one of my favorites a river runs through it is about two brothers who each take a different path in life norman maclean craig sheffer is the older of the two brothers and he is set on the path of education paul maclean brad pitt is the rebellious younger brother who travels on a path full of obstacles the movie follows these characters as the each follow their own path there is no downside to this movie you will be entertained the whole way through the acting directing and script is all perfect the two things that are exceptional are the cinematography and the score both of which entrap you in the world robert redford creates for you this is an all around great movie that is destined to be a classic it sure is in my book if you haven t seen this movie definitely watch it as soon as you can because it will stay with you forever
this is my third comment here attempting to connect two legendary movie comedy teams laurel hardy and abbott costello the connection here is the year that s the date that the former had their last movie from their longtime home studio of hal roach i ll mention the significance of the latter later on besides being the last time stan and ollie worked at the lot of fun it s also the final time they would appear with such familiar supporting players like charlie hall and james finlayson who appeared in most of their films it s also the last time art lloyd would serve as their cameraman and marvin hatley who composed their theme song which would be known as the cuckoo song dance of the cuckoos their score and it would be the very last time stan laurel would be allowed to exercise complete creative control over what goes on film if there is a more gag laden structure than usual in this l h film it s nice to know most of those gags are indeed funny that includes most of the sound and visual effects the latter provided by longtime roach staffer roy seawright in this one ollie has hornophobia from working at a noisy horn factory so dr finlayson prescribes going out to sea for his rest ollie doesn t like to go boating so stan suggests they just rent one that s docked so they wouldn t have to go anywhere after they find one they like we find out that convict nick grainger richard cramer has just escaped i ll stop there and say this was as good a finale for l h s longtime home as one could hope for it s hilarious mostly from beginning to end and knowing this would be their last for the man partly responsible for their teaming is indeed poignant when one thinks of it oh and i have a couple more lasts to mention it s the final film appearance of both harry bernard who plays a harbor patrolman after years of encountering stan and ollie as a policeman and that of ben turpin the cross eyed comic who was born in new orleans which is a couple of hours away from my current hometown of baton rouge whose second l h appearance this was having previously married the boys in our wife the latter performer especially has a genuine comic moment all right i mentioned being the year stan and ollie had their last movie released from hal roach studios it was also the first year that a comedy team both born in the state of new jersey would make their first picture at what would be their home studio universal the director of that movie would be the same one that guided l h in the flying deuces the previous year his name was a edward sutherland p s it was during this filming that script supervisor virginia lucille jones had an accident involving a rolled up carpet that incident caused oliver babe hardy to send her roses to her hospital room they fell in love and married on march it lasted until babe s death in
greatly enjoyed this mystery thriller film about a young woman nina foch julia ross who is out of work and has fallen behind in her rent and is desperate to find work julia reads an ad in the local london newspaper looking for a secretary and rushes out to try and obtain this position julia obtains the position and is hired by a mrs hughes dame may witty who requires that she lives with her employer in her home and wants her to have no involvement with men friends and julia tells them she has no family and is free to devote her entire time to this job george macready ralph hughes is the son of mrs hughes and has some very strange desires for playing around with knives this was a low budget film and most of the scenes were close ups in order to avoid the expense of a background and costs for scenery this strange family all live in a huge mansion off the cornwall coast of england and there is secret doors and plenty of suspense
john waters has given us a genuinely enjoyable film this certainly isn t without its shocking waters esque moments but it is tamer than his older culty stuff such as pink flamingoes pecker harkens back to john s early mainstream stage in that it reminds the viewer of the same kind of humor that was evident in polyester overall a really fun comedy with some great moments
why do i like disorganized crime so much why do i chuckle or laugh out loud any time i think of a dozen or more scenes from this movie it s kind of hard to explain but i ll give it a try first of all it s very funny indeed in contrast to what lots of official reviews want you to believe but then again that depends entirely on your sense of humour so there is no sense in arguing about that often the humour is in the dialogue and often it is situational comedy there is for instance this very hilarious scene in which the gang members have been given a lift in the back of a truck when the farmer drops them they just stand there by the road covered all over with cow s or whatever they are totally unnerved then realizing the humour of the scene they one by one start laughing about themselves and ruben blades as carlos looking and certainly smelling terrible nonchalantly takes out some mouth spray to at least do something about his breath simply describing the scene here makes me chuckle again which leads to the second point the acting fred gwynne lou diamond phillips william russ ruben blades and corbin bernsen okay the latter overdoes it a bit at times all fit and play their parts beautifully in fact you get the feeling they must have been enjoying themselves too when shooting the film thirdly there is the plot jim kouf the director and screenwriter is very laid back he takes his time to let the plot unfold and have the individual characters establish themselves more often than not there is no real action and yet you enjoy these very different people who attempt to rob a bank although their boss bernsen does not seem to turn up grumble about each other and even tually grudgingly like each other the movie is a fantastic parody of the typical bank robbery plot totally impossible with all its twists and coincidences yet utterly convincing in its love for ironic details incidentally the title of the film is one of the best i have ever come across because it per fectly summarizes the plot in a very ironic way therefore take my advice watch this film but if you don t chuckle grin or smile during the first minutes forget it it s not your type of film ps the only negative thing about this movie is that there seems to be no way to get hold of the screenplay if you happen to know how do tell me
it started out slow after an excellent animated intro as the director had a bunch of characters and school setting to develop once the bet is on though the movie picks up the pace as it s a race against time to see if a certain number of worms can be eaten by pm we had a good opportunity on the way home to discuss some things with our son bullies helping others mind over matter when you don t want to do something of special note is the girl who played erica erk hallie kate eisenberg the director kinda sneaks her in unexpectedly and when she is on screen she is captivating she s one of those hey she looks familiar faces and then i remembered that she was the little girl that pepsi featured about years ago she was also in paulie that movie about the parrot who tries to find his way home ms eisenberg made many tv and movie appearances in but then was not seen much for the next few years she s now and is growing up to be a beautiful woman her smile really warms up the screen if she can get some more good roles she could have as good a career or better than haley joel osment another three named kid actor but hopefully without some of the problems that osment has been in lately anywhozitz according to my y o son who just finished reading the story the film did not seem to follow the book all that well but was entertaining none the less the ending of the film seemed like a big setup for some sequels how to eat boiled slugs escargot kid s style which might not be such a bad thing it was nice to take the family to a movie and not have to worry about language violence or sex scenes one other good aspect of the movie was the respect fear engendered by the principal mr burdock boilerplate movies nowadays tend to show adult authority figures as buffoons while he has one particular goofy scene he ruled the school with a firm hand it was also nice to see andrea martin getting some work
with the advent of the imdb this overlooked movie can now find an interested audience why because users here who do a search on two time academy award winner glenda jackson can find the return of the soldier among her credits so can those checking out oscar winner julie christie fans of ann margret can give the title a click as will those looking into the career of the great alan bates not to mention the added bonus of a movie with supporting heavyweights ian holm and frank finlay any movie with so many notables in it is rewarded by the imdb given all the cross referencing that goes on here so why isn t this movie out on dvd don t the producers realize the internet movie database is a marketing gift for such a film and the return of the soldier is definitely a gem waiting to be discovered get with it people
i believe that the sopranos is an awesome show because of all the supporting characters in it i have bought every video so far and am waiting for the rest to be released in all episodes so far the best one is definitely episode denial anger acceptance this episode deals with my most favorite character of all time in the sopranos his name was brendan filone he was killed for hijacking the wrong truck and accidentally killing a truck driver brendan was awesome because he was actually one of the few characters who actually stood against tony and his gang in the end he ended up getting shot through the eye while taking a bath and that s my most favorite scene ever in the history of the sopranos brendan filone is for me and my most favorite character ever was matthew bevilaqua who was killed after attempting to murder christopher moltisanti tony and pussy shoot him in hucklebarney park after they catch and torture him my most favorite character is sean gismonte who was killed right after shooting christopher and finally my most favorite character is chucky signore one of uncle junior s henchmen he was killed on a boat by tony all the awesome characters are dead that s the only bad thing about the sopranos all the cool guys always get killed you know what would be great to change about the sopranos they should have a whole episode where they show all the dead supporting characters in hell and they are all trying to torture chris tony uncle junior silvio and paulie because they need to get their revenge brendan filone shall strike back
tess of the storm country is possibly the best movie of all of mary pickford s films at two hours it was quite long for a silent film yet continues to hold your interest some years after it was filmed mary gives one of her finest performances at times the role seems like a greatest hits performance with bits of mary the innocent mary the little devil mary the little mother mary the spitfire mary the romantic heroine etc characteristics that often were used throughout a single film in the past the movie is surprisingly frank about one supporting character s illegitimate child for and at one point our little mary is thought the unwed mother in question if the academy awards had been around in no doubt the best actress oscar for the year would have been mary s
i m from romania i ll try to speak in english all i want to say about this movie is that it is and will be my all time number one seen it above times at least and will see it for many years now it has all the little things i like in a movie it s very touching makes me cry shows a whole lot of twisted love things and questions about love and reality and the true things that matter for different people it so happens that for me this matters the most the love the soul of a man he s inner being and this i see in this movie perhaps for me it s much more than a motion picture it s a proof in my mind that it could really exist and that you most make the best out of every moment you live with your soul mate it s a long way from reality to sci fi but what if what if all the capitalism disappeared and economy would go down would fall we would all be concerned about other issues and my thought is that on your death bed the bigger thing you remember is not the wealth not the adventure not the countries you visited and the people that remember you but the true friends and your true love and the hope that after you die all will be god damn perfect and people would be good and care more watch this movie and probably it will guide you through your life like it did to me hail from romania
i watched this movie after watching practical magic and the older film was far superior i liked the way the lighting makeup and costumes changed as gillian changed in the story jimmy stewart s mannerisms didn t do a lot for me in this film but i suppose they did serve to highlight the reserve of gillian s character i was also struck by nicky s and gillian s mannerisms it was as if the director wanted him to appear effeminate and gillian to appear masculine the gestures nicky makes when he s showing redlich his powers especially struck me i ve never thought of warlocks as being effeminate so it was an interesting way of contrasting those characters
the movie frailty is actually more of a psychological thriller than it is a horror film it has all the trappings of a horror film but this it is not frailty is a film about perceptions of religion and realizing the differences between right and wrong in frailty a middle aged father bill paxton and his two sons claim to be doing the work of god it turns out that they are a trio of notorious serial killers called god s hands we watch the father kill the demons in some rather brutal ways while convincing his sons and himself that they are doing the work god and that what they are doing is right he claims that he received a message from an angel who gave him specific instructions to eliminate the demons living here on earth god has given him a list of names and in return for his services he and his sons will be given protection which basically means the police will never be able to capture them we see all of this unfold in front of us in a very disturbing manner but what is really disturbing about it all is the effect that it has on the two sons particularly the oldest son adam adam himself seriously doubts the existence of a supreme being that is until his father and a week in the cellar changes all of that he knows that his father has obviously lost his mind and is pretty sure the same is happening to his younger brother fenton fenton the other half of this puzzle takes everything in as if it were his own religion he seems trapped in his father s world of god and demons i suppose this is because he s so young and easily impressionable but everything that happens to these three is rather convincing in fact too convincing the events that occur in the film can be looked upon as a vivid hallucination that is being experienced by the three main characters i say this because they each react to the situation in different ways and at one point in the film they each claim to see god dad first sees the murders as his mission his mission eventually consumes him and quickly turns into an obsession with eradicating demons in fact his hallucination is the primary one his orders and the list of names he receives are all a part of this hallucination watch the scene where dad finds the ax in a barn to figure out where i am coming from fenton the younger son is easily impressed by all of this talk of demons and destruction since he is so young it s easy for him to fall into his father s trap adam on the other is very skeptical towards his father s actions spoilers in a way the hallucination ends when dad is killed towards the end of the movie i will not say how or under what circumstances but i will say that it is not pleasant after his death it fast forwards to the present day the story is being told through flashbacks as seen through the eyes of the oldest son adam in actuality it is fenton that is telling the story not adam as originally believed the story is being told the way he perceived it through his actions and his brother s actions fenton has gone insane and is continuing what his father started by luring the fbi agent into his trap since religion is a major theme in this movie the film also plays on how easy it is for religion to be misinterpreted by those that do not have a full understanding of it before dad discovered his newfound mission he himself did not have a clear understanding of religion nor did he fully believe in a supreme being his sons fenton and adam often sang innocent little children s church hymns but yet probably did not have a clear understanding of what the lyrics meant after the revelation of dad s newfound mission they both took off in separate directions adam remained in doubt of there being a supreme being while fenton was gradually sucked into his father s madness a very good thriller that will creep the heck out of you do not watch it alone
i thought that baseketball was one of the most funniest films i have ever seen it s witty humour made me giggle all the way through and the fact that trey and matt are so over the top boosts the film s comedy i have just bought baseketball on dvd and its just one of those movies where you would never get tired of watching it i have a very short attention span and i think this film has so any funny bits that it keeps me entertained throughout the humorous quotes are memorable and can make me laugh for hours if i remember them later so overall i think that baseketball is brilliant movie which everyone should go see especially if you re younger like me as it will keep you laughing for a long time afterwards p s does anybody think its weird for me to like them both hehe
spoiler for anyone who is lucky enough to ever see this film so not really spoiler after all saw this film when it was released and can still remember parts of it it s all set in a small town in the west or what is left of that town it more resembles a ghost town with few inhabitants among them a couple where the wife is especially wicked she lets her man die in the end of the film and leaves the town but has to cross the desert we never know what happens to her next but just before she left her dying man shoots after her and deliberately does not hit her and instead the water supply she is not aware of that soon she will be very thirsty mark damon kills a couple of bad guys in a funny manor but that s another story which i don t remember too good the remaining impression of the film was that it was one of the first times i saw a really wicked woman on film who pretends to be anything but wicked can t be compared with the witch in snowwhite who in comparison is easy to find out very tight western with few main characters and still absorbing
robin williams and kurt russell play guys in their s who put their marraiges in jeopardy by deciding russell somewhat reluctantly to replay their heartbreaking tie with rival bakersfield years after the fact williams is ok but russell is flat out great as legendary taft quarterback remo hightower holly palance does a nice and attractive turn as williams wife who could live without this rematch film is worth watching just to see the famed remo in action highly recommended
stephen king movies are a funny thing with me i either really love them or i loathe them some of the fancier productions such as desperation and storm of the century i didn t enjoy some of the smaller ones i really loved sleepwalkers is one that i really do enjoy and watch it regularly the story revolves around charles brady and his mother mary they are sleepwalkers shape shifting creatures who although human like in appearance shift into a feline like creature they are immune to the scratch of cats and whenever they move to a new town lay out traps to catch and kill the animals when they move to their latest town they need to seek out a virgin and when charles finds one he actually falls for her but his mother needs to feed from her to keep up her strength the story revolves around what will happen with the girl will charles spare her or use her to save his mother although this story has overtones of incest which some may find unappealing it does actually play a part in the story and is therefore not just plonked in the movie for scandal s sake like most stephen king stories it s based in a small town with lots of interesting characters the acting isn t the best nor are the special effects however somehow the whole thing tends to gel and is very watchable and enjoyable adaption for uk readers this production has most recently been shown on bbc sci fi and sky thriller horror channels
while watching this movie i was frustrated and distracted and by the end i wanted to give the movie a solid or i thought the animation was random and all over the place and there was too much going on even my a d d couldn t keep up it felt like a slight acid trip everything looked flat there was no dimension to anything there were so many shapes lines and patterns i really wanted to stop the movie mid way and smash my burned copy of this movie but after i finish watching it i went online to read up on the movie and i should have done a little research into this movie before watching the secret of kells is loosely based on the true story about the original book of kells a small boy brendan is given the task of penning new pages in what is set to be the greatest book ever written this book will contain information that will help change darkness into light brendan lives in the village of kells behind huge stone walls taking place in the th century brendan s uncle the abbot of kells is trying to build the wall to keep the vikings out brendan s uncle insist he help complete the wall but a traveler and keeper of the book secretly trains brendan to hone in on his illustration skills and convinces him to complete the book and carry out it s word the entire time i watched the movie i thought i was missing something because i didn t really understand what was going on i figured i was just missing a piece of irish history a simple google search taught me all i needed to know about the original book of kells after reading many articles my opinion of the movie greatly changed the book of kells is a copied version of the first few books of the new testament transcribed into latin by gaelic monks in ireland in the th century along with it s paleographic and insular script the book is also beautifully illustrated in insular art a type of early art form know for it s intricacy complexity and miniature illustrations much of the art in the book of kells is depicted as lots of art was at the time flat and dimensionality challenged with no perspective but what makes the book of kells stand out from other early pieces of art is it s use of many colors the secret of kells is very colorful i originally thought the animation was flat and boring it reminded me a lot of the cartoon samurai jack which also had a flat and amine look to it once i learned about the art styles of the book of kells it s obvious that many of the styles from the book are mimicked in the movie there are lines and swirls and various shapes that inhabit brendan s mind whenever he goes into his imagination circular shapes resembling the sun cogs clocks and wheels begin filling the screen the edges of the screen become framed in decorated moving triangles or circles transitions are filled with color and celtic knots from the trees to the floors many things in this world are covered in shapes or patterns clocking in at minutes minus credits the secret of kells is a fun little history lesson with a little adventure and silliness thrown in to keep people maybe just children interested i think one has to generally be open mined to the secret of kells as half art piece half movie about history despite looking like it was animated with adobe illustrator it s a very nice looking movie but based on the films submitted for oscar consideration i don t think it was worth being nominated over mary and max thatwasjunk blogspot com

there is a bit of trivia which should be pointed out about a scene early in the movie where homer watches the attempt of december at least that was the video used on the tv he was watching which showed the vangard launch attempt which failed he is next shown reading or dictating a letter to dr von braun offering condolences about the failure von braun was at marshall space flight center in huntsville working for the army the vanguard project was by the early nasa team which was at what soon became goddard space flight center the army rushed the jupiter c which was essentially a us made v technology but worked to launch a satellite in response to russia s success with sputnik this error may have actually been made by homer because of the notoriety of von braun but his team didn t have their attempt fail in fact the underlying redstone was flying from and was the first us man rated booster used for shepard s sub orbital flight as well as grissom s this is why this sort of movie is so good as it hopefully will inspire people to read up and spot these bits of trivia and in the process see what has been done and be inspired to do more
titanic directed by james cameron presents a fictional love story on the historical setting of the titanic the plot is simple noncomplicated or not for those who love plots that twist and turn and keep you in suspense the end of the movie can be figured out within minutes of the start of the film but the love story is an interesting one however kate winslett is wonderful as rose an aristocratic young lady betrothed by cal billy zane early on the voyage rose meets jack leonardo dicaprio a lower class artist on his way to america after winning his ticket aboard titanic in a poker game if he wants something he goes and gets it unlike the upper class who are so concerned with their social worries the two fall in love and the audience sees the sinking of the titanic primarily through their eyes the movie begins in modern times with the exploration of the wreck by a group searching for treasures that sunk with the titanic which has recently occurred one of the survivors of the titanic rose dewitt bukater who had heard of the exploration of the wreck on television and is flown to the boat where the search is being led from to tell of what she remembers to help the search she gets to telling her memory of the one and only voyage of the titanic with this the scene shifts to southhampton ireland where the titanic set sail from on april as all the passengers are boarding after another stop on the irish coast titanic went out to see on its maiden voyage across the atlantic bound for new york historically the first few days of the voyage went by uneventful but the fictional plot of the story is developed during this time as rose sees the hopeless entrapement of an engagement that she is in to the wealthy cal hockley and falls in love with third class passenger jack dawson captain smith alledgedly as shown in the movie was urged by the white star line director to increase the speed of the ship so they would make the newspaper headlines and receive extra publicity by arriving in new york on thursday night and not on friday morning as planned smith then ordered the fateful decision going against his thirty two years of experience to stretch the titanic s legs out to full speed the titanic had reports that the waters in the atlantic they were sailing in were full of icebergs but they ignored these warnings and proceeded at full speed as shown in the movie on april at an iceberg was sighted they attempted to shut off the engines and turn the ship out of the path of the iceberg but there was not enough time and the ship hit the iceberg on the starboard side as depicted in the film the portrayal of the many small holes in the side of the ship and not one large gash along the side is accurate the crew of titanic sent out distress calls and set off distress rockets as shown until when the lights finally failed the lights of the california were spotted six miles away but they failed to realize what was going on and did not respond to titanic s many pleas for help the california had tried earlier in the day to warn titanic of the severe ice that had caused them to stop their trip but titanic had brushed them off causing the california to turn off its radio and leave the titanic on its own the first class women and children were the first as depicted to be put into the twenty lifeboats that were on the ship overwhelmingly the third class passengers suffered the most amount of deaths of any class and the crew was hit hard in this tragedy too the word of white star line employees and first class passengers was believed over that of second and third class passengers when authorities were trying to gain information of the sinking also the metal that was used to build the titanic has been found in recent years under conditions of severe cold which were experienced the night titanic sank to be extremely brittle overall the basic plot is very accurate in its portayal of the events and the times at which these events took place on the titanic many of the characters in the story were not real and created simply for the purpose of the movie or as composite characters to represent possible characteristics and ideas of people on the ship the core group of rose jack cal and rose s mother all were fictional characters added into the story as they represent different groups of people from the time yet many characters such as the unsinkable molly brown captain edward smith the ship designer thomas andrew the white star line representative bruce ismay and all of the titanic s officers were real the maiden voyage was going to be captain edward smith s last voyage anyway as he planned to retire afterwards he had been a part of the white star line since where he worked his way up to his status as the millionaire s captain when the titanic sunk the portrayals of the officers is accurate as only four survived the tragedy except for the officer who threatened to kill all of the passengers of the ship with his pistol he is on record as acting heroicly and was misportrayed to the point that james cameron apologized and evoked a monument in his honor in the officer s former canadian hometown as shown in the movie there was a language problem between the crew and many of the lower class passengers from non english speaking nations in addition officer lowe was the only officer who came back in the lifeboat as depicted the old people shown in their bed as the water came in their room were based on the strauss not wanting to leave her husband s side mrs strauss refused to get in her lifeboat and died with her husband on the titanic furthermore mr goggenheim who was shown sipping his brandy and smoking a cigar reportedly did go out like this dressed in his best the richest man on the ship john jacob astor who owned most of manhattan died nonetheless as well but his much younger wife was saved in a lifeboat in addition molly brown was saved and later had medals made up for the crew of the carpethia that picked the survivors of titanic up from the water her ticket on the titanic had cost over four thousand dollars and by the end of her life she ended up broke all of the interiors of the ship were masterfully replacated down to the last pieces of china and silverware the gymnasium which is hardly seen is recreated perfectly with all of the machines reproduced to match those seen in old photographs the wonderful outfits and costuming were an excellent re creation of the post victorian era of the rich at this time practically ruled everything as the women s suffrage movement had not quite gotten moving yet women during this time often married for financial security as rose was considering doing and normally took a back seast status to their husbands as cal wished for rose to do the rich did not take well to new money such as molly brown as depicted everything of the time was very formal women had to be escorted to dinner by a male figure as seen with in the dining scenes smoking was not very common among women of the time but holders of cigarettes which were just coming in at the time were used as seen with rose in the movie men of the time generally smoked cigars not cigarettes women were constained physically by their corsets and socially by society although james cameron had no background in historical films he brought in experts of titanic coupled with two years spent cross referencing the history of the titanic and few liberties were taken the beautiful cinematography and special effects also helped to make the film even more breathtaking a recognizable message can be seen in the movie titanic as the people on the ship had about three hours to contemplate their demise the director james cameron shows the various reactions to this time of crisis in people s lives everyone reacts differently and he gets you to think of how you might have reacted had you been in that situation on the titanic on that fateful night in addition this film is a reflection of the s when it was produced as it gives a look into the wreck of the titanic only in the past fifteen years has the site of the actual titanic been found and explored this movie was able to give us a deeper look into a disaster that many would not have viewed however the moral question of whether people today should be taking treasures from the wreck of an underwater graveyard is posed there have been attempts to stop treasure seeking missions such as the one portrayed in titanic but all have failed as it stands today anyone can make a voyage to the titanic and take whatever valuables they as portrayed in the film showing the general values of our time on this matter technically the film is very well done to get footage of the wreck at the bottom of the ocean it took twelve dives to get all of the footage needed for the movie in addition a special camera had to be created to withstand the intense pressure at the bottom of the ocean cameron did not plan on using the probe to go as far inside titanic as anyone has in the years since the ship sunk but it worked out that this provided an unique perspective into the ship furthermore throughout the film fade ins and outs from the wreck of titanic to the scene of titanic during its actual voyage this shift between the modern scene to the past scene during the voyage works as an excellent transition that makes the story easy to follow in aclear manner at the very beginning of the movie a septune recreation is used to recreate the scene when the actual people left the european coast on titanic giving it distinction from the rest of the events of the film titanic plays almost like a historical biography and is like a work of art a true epic like most history novels we know the ending but it doesn t take away from the wonderful treats that can be found in this picture certain aspects of this film are academy award material including costuming sound cintematography and editing if you like interesting characters that will give you an insight into the life of characters in the early s and how they face disaster then this movie definitely is for you
okay first of i hate commenting on this thing but i felt like i had to stand up for this movie so many people were bashing on it and i felt like people who might want to see it should get a second opinion first off bend it like beckham is not meant to be the most profound movie of the century if that s what you re looking for go somewhere else just because it is an independent film does not mean it has to be artsy it s supposed to make you feel good and you re supposed to have fun watching it and those two things are handily accomplished secondly the acting though not halle berry in monster s ball is still good the movie doesn t need acting like that honestly so don t look for it it s a family movie if that s what you wanted you wouldn t or shouldn t even be looking into this movie honestly lastly it has a really cute story i think it s thought out well and it s entertaining to watch it s also very true to life for the most part for that culture so if you want to sit down and watch a movie that you can enjoy and feel good about when you re finished if you re looking for something with deep thought out plot lines and big dramatic scenes this is not for you lyndsay
i disagree with previous comment about this movie i think it was cute and fun and it carried a good message for young girls like my daughter you don t have to dress like a cheap hooker to be cool you can be smart and pretty and classy all at once i think the cast was good and the story was fine for the target audience all in all my wife daughter and i each thought it was a good movie i certainly recommend it it also has encouraged my daughter to start reading the original nancy drew mysteries which i am sure she will love much as i loved the hardy boys it was a struggle to get her to sleep tonight because she wanted to start reading right away i can t think of a better outcome for that movie than rekindling interest in that classic series
the story of the boy thief of bagdad as it was once spelled has attracted filmmakers from raoul walsh in who starred douglas fairbanks in the first silent rendering of thief of bagdad to less imposing more recent attempts the best however remains s version which for its time was a startling magical panoply of top quality special effects those effects still work their charm no less than six directors are listed for the technicolor movie which starred sabu as the boy thief abu john justin as the dreamily in love deposed monarch ahmad and june duprez as the lovely princess sought by ahmad and pursued by the evil vizier jaffar played by a sinister conrad veidt the giant genie is ably acted by rex ingram ahmad is treacherously deposed by jaffar and when later arrested by that traitorous serpent he and the boy abu suffer what are clearly incapacitating fates ahmad is rendered blind and abu becomes a lovable mutt their adventures through the gaily decorated hollywood backlots are fun but the special effects make this film work two men were responsible for everything from a magic flying carpet to the gargantuan genie who pops out of a bottle with a tornado like black swirl lawrence w butler and tom howard howard incidentally did the special effects for the version of this film both men had long and distinguished careers in technical wizardry duprez is outstandingly lovely while little called on for serious acting justin s ahmad projects a driven but dreamy romanticism untouched by erotic impulses sabu is really the central actor in many scenes and he s very good for a movie meant for kids as well as adults there s a fair amount of violence but of the bloodless kind still i don t think anyone under eight ought to see thief of bagdad this film makes periodic appearances on tv but today my teenage son and i saw it in a theater with quite a few youngsters present it was great to see computer besotted kids in an affluent community respond with cheers and applause to special effects that must seem primitive to them thief of bagdad is a pre war hollywood classic from a time when strong production values often resulted in enduringly attractive and important releases this is one of the best of its kind
if any style of film could be called my guilty pleasure it d be this generic fantasy type guilty is the wrong word for it though as i m pretty pleased to be an escapist from time to time stardust is good stock fantasy the likes of which one should expect from neil gaiman or gaiman adaptation as it were it isn t the visual dream scape of mirrormask it isn t the adult pretension of pan s labyrinth and it isn t the fun loving classic the princess bride but it contains just what the fantasy lover is familiarized enough with to be completely comfortable during the entire viewing fantasy lovers should rejoice special effects work has finally become good enough and cheap enough that this stuff is in regular production now the story of stardust involves a young man named tristan who in order to gain the love and approval of the most beautiful girl in their small town of wall goes on an adventure to retrieve a fallen star to make things difficult however tristan s fallen star is actually a woman named yvaine and he s not the only one looking for her some witches have their greedy eyes on the immortality the star s heart can give and a brother s feud over the magic kingdom leads murderous princes in her direction from there it s all pretty predictable but it involves some attractive fantasy elements some warm hearted commentary on the nature of love and the best part robert deniro as a gay pirate on that note deniro s performance is spot on it s not the excessive lisp that most actors use to portray gay people but a surprisingly effective one from someone used to being seen as a rough and gruff typecast character thus the ongoing joke surrounding his character matching deniro s own opening up into alternate forms of acting deniro hasn t been so unique to his own image since brazil and that s saying something stardust is the type of movie perhaps that will subsist on children s and fantasy lover s shelves for a long time i can t say it offers anything new but it s not really there to it s actually those most familiar with it s tropes that will enjoy it the most polarisdib
i was forced to see this because a i have an year old girl and b we had shown her the bonita granville nacy drew movies from the s which she thoroughly enjoyed personally i didn t think it was as humorous as the s flicks but on the other hand it wasn t the nauseating piece of intelligence insulting fluff i feared it would be it was an inoffensive mildly entertaining movie although i m pleased that they didn t try to upgrade nancy to st century hipness veronica mars holds the title as the modern nancy drew i do think that they made her a little too bland that they didn t do enough to develop nancy drew the movie could have been titled jane doe girl detective i have to blame the script i think each actor did a good job with what they had to work with i liked emma roberts in this role but they gave her a made for tv not theatrical release script
don t be fooled by the silly title folks this is one sweet ride a true successor to tetsuo the iron man and ichi the killer this gem starts with a bang and lays the gore on thick until the credits roll it seems that aliens are taking over people s bodies and modifying them into war machines which are then used to fight each other in a twisted game for the amusement of their species the winner of the battle eats the loser alive that s mostly it for plot but who cares when the gore is this good i have no idea how many buckets of slime were used but it s disgusting to behold there is interesting and effective use of stop motion when the takeovers are in progress and loving care is lavished on all of the creature and make up effects the cgi is a bit limited but that actually doesn t detract from the overall quality one bit at least for me this was truly a fun and stomach turning film that deserves much praise and has truly earned its place in the stack of cult classics find it and watch you won t be disappointed
this movie has one of the cheesiest plots i have seen for me that s what makes it so awesome fred gwynne and al lewis are very good at what they achieved in the original munsters series while there was less slapstick they still worked wonderfully together comedically i wish yvonne de carlo as lily would have had more plot involvement she showed that she could do comedy in the original series but it was mostly wasted in this movie this movie also stars the great sid caesar but sadly he doesn t have any interaction with gwynne and lewis i think some better work could have come out of that
by no means my favourite austen novel and paltrow is by no means my favourite actress but i found the film almost totally delightful paltrow does a good job and cummings stevenson and the one who plays miss bates are all absolutely terrific the period detail is not alienating the feel of the movie is just right in fact but the real find is jeremy northam as mr knightley there could not be more perfect casting imo i hated mr k in the novel but found him wonderfully human and humane in the film northam s good looks and smiling eyes are no hindrance to enjoyment either highly recommended anar
mario s first foray into the world of dimensions is incredible miyamoto s masterpiece was reason enough to buy a nintendo when it was released in and it still holds all of it s charm today this game is an instant classic that set the standard for d adventure platform games
one shot one kill no exceptions a must see if you are into marines or snipers two big thumbs up great overall storyline great camera work good drama action details and more pretty close to the real thing but this isn t a film to breakdown and pick out the editing faults this is to sit back and have a good mins the plot has some depth but this movie isn t really about making you think its about enjoying the sniper lifestyle and action sniper and are pretty good follow ups but the first is still the best overall movie tom berenger does a great job playing his character and showing the hidden side of the sniper life the plain of dealing with all of the death must see for sniper fans
for the record i am not affiliated with the production in any way hidden frontier is probably the star trek fan film with the most episodes produced to date over seasons this is the last they have produced some or so episodes this is no mean feat on almost no budget and everyone volunteering their time and energy by their own admission the earlier seasons do not have as good production qualities as later ones but as they progress the effects green screen work and acting all improve i did find it difficult to dip into so started from the beginning and watched all the way through hf benefits from story arcs just like all the best sci fi and dovetails nicely into the star trek universe in which it is set characters and relatives from the original series have been brought into the stories and add a lot to the feel of the stories sometimes improving on the characters over the original the whole experience includes an excellent web site blooper reels a high membership forum which is frequented by many of the actors and production staff and a weekly chat if you are looking for high definition high budget productions this is probably not for you if you are looking for continued adventures in the star trek universe with stories that does star trek credit and makes you think this is the one
when i was told of this movie i thought it would be another chick flick i was wrong this movie sends a powerful message about judging others i was deeply moved everyone i have encountered i have recommended this movie to no one has come back saying it was bad busy also did a great job with her role in this film i don t know much about her acting career but wow they way she pulled off the end of this fill was great at the beginning it was a little slow but after she went to the hospital wow the movie picks up again i have no idea why this movie hasn t been spoken of in the movie world my wish would be for this movie to be released again and advertised more because it sends a powerful message in a mere hour and a half
why didn t this pick up a bag full of oscars it is an amazing interpretaion of an oft filmed performed piece the visuals are breathtaking especially in wide screen the pan scan really kills this film s wonderful cinematography and sets every frame is a painting astounding the play is almost completely intact and branagh s passion for it is clear from the opening titles on no zefferelli here just great storytelling the way only film can but rarely does jacobi is especially perfect as hamlet s murderous uncle he doesn t play him as a mustache curling evil villian but a charming politician allowing us to see why only hamlet suspects foul play branagh also nails the subtlety of the line between hamlet s fake real madness and the burning revenge inside him and the many cameos come off quite well everyone from billy crystal and robin williams to gerard depardeu and charlton heston unobtrusive if you are sucked into branagh s vision the way i was a mesmerizing piece
i absolutely loved this film i do not at all relate to all the other comments i have read about it i was completely enthralled through every second i found the story gripping the acting intense and the direction spot on i would literally jump every time the phone would ring close to the end of the movie even though there was nothing scary about the story itself i was soundly on edge through the whole movie and for the rest of my evening i found that there were so many perfect choices made the casting the script the little bits of humor sprinkled in it there were so many points where the film could ve gone for the cheap thrill but it never did and that for me put this movie above so many of the mediocre thrillers that have come out lately and for the last number of years
there are many police dramas doing the rounds i am not sure why it s probably to do with the old basic theme of good versus evil this film has a documentary style as we follow the difficult initiation of anne a raw recruit into a police squad stationed in the baltic area no attempt is made to glamorise the police they are truly down to earth harsh at times and unforgiving anne on the other hand has a soft heart perhaps a little more understanding of the human condition against all rules she sometimes holds back incriminating information found on her strip searches and other investigations this is not a pleasant film not one to relax you there is not much feeling of optimism in it the police seem to be involved in a losing battle tomorrow there will be more bashings more murders more family break ups and more distressed children let s face it this is the world we live in as days go by anne becomes more intimately involved with the police and with the families they are investigating the only real warmth in the film is that provided by the character benny a year old from a broken family anne has her own way of patching things up she turns a blind eye to benny s shoplifting and tries to help him as best she can i was surprised though that she went so far as to seduce benny s father it set me wondering if it was in consideration of the father or her own needs after all the film makes it clear that she was desperately in need of a partner and loving children well cast but not my idea of an evening s entertainment
given its time of release the story that unravels in thriller panic in the streets was hardly a surprise the corpse of a mysterious illegal immigrant is found and passed off as a nobody until further examination from a public health inspector who claims the corpse carries a strain of bubonic plague yet with the current drama in the world today this strangely helps this film in appearing credible for today s viewers the cast and crew are flawless richard widmark in his first role following his breakthrough performance in night and the city jack palance in his chilling film debut also starring in this film are paul douglas and a young and rather cute barbara bel geddes a whole slew of uncredited non professional actors typical of director kazan fill in the remaining slots elia kazan directs joe macdonald films he would later work with richard widmark again in s much superior pickup on south street and the great alfred newman scores it nearly everyone involved here has done better work panic in the streets is quite the rewarding watch nonetheless especially for the film noir enthusiast
zero day leads you to think even re think why two boys young men would do what they did commit mutual suicide via slaughtering their classmates it captures what must be beyond a bizarre mode of being for two humans who have decided to withdraw from common civility in order to define their own mutual world via coupled destruction it is not a perfect movie but given what money time the filmmaker and actors had it is a remarkable product in terms of explaining the motives and actions of the two young suicide murderers it is better than elephant in terms of being a film that gets under our rationalistic skin it is a far far better film than almost anything you are likely to see flawed but honest with a terrible honesty
terribly underrated with matt dillon and tom skerritt good backdrop for solid story and some memorable lines well acted and well cast tommy lee jones and bruce dern make you hate them with passion
as we all know the sub genre of sex comedies is pretty crowded simply being excessively raunchy isn t enough anymore i ve seen and heard so many disgusting jokes and actions that a sex comedy really needs to have other positive points to appeal to me these days coming into the year old virgin i knew basically what to expect i did see the commercials after all is it true that if you don t use it you lose it what i didn t expect to find is a heart and honest attempts at character development there s still the weird off the wall characters that we see so much in adam sandler movies and there s still enough inappropriate language to sink noah s ark but somehow the movie has a worthwhile love story and yes even a message the main character andy is unfortunately for me a person i can relate to in the first shot i see that he even shares my love for mystery science theater he has a poster for the movie on his wall and throughout the movie we get to see his really neat collection of antiquities andy also has plenty of video games and a working knowledge of films and technology andy doesn t want to buy a car because he prefers his bike most importantly of all andy is a nice person he doesn t swear and he respect women so much that he stays away from them combine all these factors and everybody begins to think he s a serial murderer it s like my life story the other characters each have funny little stories to go along with their slightly exaggerated personalities and they all work on a certain level but not the way andy does i felt that it was sort of distracting in a way since andy and his girlfriend trish are really the only truly human characters in the entire movie i suppose since i mentioned one flaw i might as well bring the other noticeable one to light the story is clever but too predictable and as far as romances go it s quite simple it deals with andy s relationship with trish for a long time and we all know what s going to happen in the end sure its final detour is a bit different than we may expect but you know what s going to happen in the end and i assure you it does these are definitely small stains on the movie but there s so much good here that i can easily ignore it s few faults when i say good i mean bad of course this is a sex comedy and it wants to be bad for the most part i think it succeeded there are so many hilarious scenes such as andy trying to get rid of an erection after refusing to have sex with trish or the scene where andy goes with his trish s daughter to a sexual education class where he ends up asking more questions than anybody else ah and we must not forget the soon to be classic chest waxing sequence ooh como se llama an interesting little note about that scene the actor steve carell actually did wax his belly and the pain shown is real of course they only did one take but it was still a very brave thing to do on his part actually since we re talking about steve carell i d like to say that he has now risen on my list of respected comedians which is sort of odd since i didn t even know who he was prior to seeing this film i was just so impressed by his writing acting and timing that i now really want to keep an eye out for his future roles this man has talent it the year old virgin proves that to be honest i had doubts about this film but early word was positive and i knew it was something i was eventually going to see i m glad that i did too since it s probably one of the funniest movies i ve seen in a long time and it doubles as something you feel is worth watching it s not simply a series of sex gags lumped together rather it s a series of sex gags entwined with a very worthwhile character and a truly touching romance now excuse me while i go puke my guts out i can t believe i just wrote that my review from frider waves http friderwaves com index php page virgin
after having read two or three negative reviews on the main page of imdb for pushing daisies and having literally minutes ago finished watching the final episode i thought it was about time i said what i thought of pd first off to address what some of the issues that i have seen other people having with this show something along the lines of i expect the people who have been woken from the dead to have a more realistic reaction realistic on this show pushing daisies is truly pure and utter escapism it s colour palette the dialogue used the scenarios situations music all of it to me is just an escape from everyday life an escape from the mundane and boring it is here where pushing daisies exceeds exceptionally well pushing daisies isn t for everyone a large majority of the television audience don t get it for some people it s just too out there and silly but for people like me even from the first episode i watched of it season s frescorts and i was just blown away by the show from then on i bought both the box sets and they have barely been out of my dvd player other people i know can t stand it it really seems to be like marmite the show follows the adventures of ned the piemaker with a magic finger who brings back childhood sweetheart charlotte charles works in association with private investigator emerson cod owns the pie hole and employs waitress olive snook completing the main cast members are aunts lily and vivian whom charlotte chuck is never allowed to see they live in a fantasy world where the dead are brought back to life everything is shown with a wonderfully bright splash of colour and narrated by jim dale other than outlining the basics of the show i really can t praise it much more without saying just watch it despite being screwed over by the writer s guild of america strike with only episodes ever to be made it provides wonderful plot twists story lines characters and situations while providing for me a satisfying ending yes i could tell it had been tacked on the end and rushed but i was still happy with the way it went out whether it is creative or just pretentious for a lot of people me included it made the most addictive and wonderful viewing and i hope for the future of television that more shows like this are created so i m not left with just minute memories of what true entertainment can be
saw this movie at the rotterdam iff you may question some decisions of the maker like choosing a mockumentary form for such a sensitive and horrible subject but this movie sure hits you in the gut especially the last scenes were almost painful to watch hope it gets the distribution it deserves
a chance encounter between a salesman and a hit man changes both their lives this is an odd film that works an impressive effort for writer director shepard in a daringly unglamorous role that is a far cry from james bond brosnan is surprisingly effective as the lonely hit man who starts to buckle under the stress of his job but is unable to connect emotionally with anyone to help him cope kinnear is equally good as the salesman a decent fellow with a void in his life davis is fine as kinnear s flirtatious wife mainly a character study the film is rewarding because it feels fresh and unpredictable an extremely dark comedy
when i read other comment i decided to watch this movie first cast specially michael madsen and tamer karadagli good enough film very intelligence and interesting because cast have a lot of international specially european actor and actress like from turkey and russsia second story is basic and you can guess but if you interesting action good play you ll like in my opinion third final chapter is not special or interesting it s regular like other action movies finally i recommend to watch this movie and i hope you ll love it enjoy d
i have seen this movie a whole dozen times and it s awesome but the only thing with it was that in the beginning there was too much talk of who s going out with who i think that it would be interesting to do a remake of it but on the official site they said that they will not be making a remake of it because so many people have gotten saved when viewing it what s even happened to patty dunning now she is a pretty good actress she has done several other movies in the s and s but we haven t heard from her since i know for sure about thom rachford who plays jerry works for accounting at rd films but overall i have to say that the series itself is like left behind gone old school
shinjuku triad society chinese mafia wars is unlikely to get distribution in the west outside film festivals why could your censors stomach a film where policemen anally rape male and female suspects to get them to talk and the victims enjoy it or see an old lady have her eye torn out of her skull these are just a few of the shocks in store for viewers of this ultraviolent cops and gangsters story it makes clockwork orange which was banned for years in the uk look like a disney cartoon should you see this film yes it is fantastic and essential viewing for fans of asian cinema the shocking moments are there to illustrate what goers on in the world of these characters if you like this make sure you catch dead or alive which is very similar barring the insane ending in doa of course great for japan that they have a talent like miike working at the same time as takeshi kitano the best chance of seeing this film outside a takashi miike retrospective at a film festival is on dvd if i haven t put you off try hunting for a hong kong version on the web as i m sure it will come out in that country
this started out to be a movie about the street culture of the bronx in new york what it accomplished was to give birth to a new culture and way of life for american youth what other movie has done this except rebel without a cause one of the most important movies of all time the elements are simple yet fascinating the story is timeless young people try to succeed against all odds yet the story is always believable and never depressing the characters are so realistic a city dweller would recognize them as neighbors the story is entertaining and comes to a satisfying ending buy this one for your permanent collection it is a piece of american history
a surprisingly effective thriller this david duchovny and michelle ensign ro forbes are a successful professional couple he a writer she a photographer forbes is desperate to move to california and in an act of compromise mulder agrees to the move on the condition that along the way they visit sites of historical interest concerning famous serial killers his idea he writes the words she takes the pictures with the end result a bestselling coffee table book that will set them up for life to help finance the trip they decide to car share and advertise the fact as their bad luck would have it brad pitt sees the advert and shortly after killing his landlord he and his girlfriend juliette lewis meet the writer couple and begin their cross country trek inevitably mischief ensues pitt is outstanding as the genuinely chill inspiring early grayce and is capably backed up by lewis playing her customary white trash character that seems to be her default setting duchovny and forbes make for a convincing double act too and as events spiral out of control you as the viewer are sucked into their plight and can feel the tension ratcheting intelligent sinister and beautifully shot this deserves recognition beyond its current status a top movie
the only complaint i have about this adaptation is that it is sexed up things that were only hinted at in the novel are shown on screen for some weird reason did they think the audience would be too stupid to understand if they were not shown everything out right other than that this is very good quality all the actors do marvelous jobs bringing their characters to life for the shallow women out there it s worth watching at least because toby stephens as gilbert is the sexiest thing ever if i were helen i would have conveniently forgotten i was still married the minute i laid eyes on him sort of a spoiler the ending scene is a funny reversal of what happened in the book
in cold blood has to be ranked as first rate movie making even if the subject matter is about as grim as it gets in the world of make believe but film noir fans should definitely find this one a gripping piece of work based as it is on a true life crime spree it opens with quincy jones music under the credits and starkly dramatic views of a highway bus heading toward kansas city effectively setting the mood of the film even before the credits end the b w photography of conrad hall does a superb job right from the start also clear from the start robert blake and scott wilson are natural born actors they do a great job of portraying free spirited buddies looking for the next thrill ever see a millionaire fry in the electric hair hell no there are two kinds of rules in this world one for the rich and one for the poor says wilson taking a swig of alcohol behind the wheel both are destined to cross the path of a farm family showing no mercy and leaving no witnesses behind blake reminiscing about movies and thinking of hunting for gold in mexico says remember bogart in treasure of the sierra madre an ironic moment because blake himself was in the film as a little boy selling lottery tickets i got you pegged for a natural born killer wilson tells blake john forsythe is one of the lead detectives on the case discovering that all four family members were tied up shot in the head and one had his throat cut don t people around here lock doors asks paul stewart they will tonight is the terse reply after the murders the killers discover that there was no big fat safe in the wall like their prison informant told them so in the end it was truly a stupid senseless crime the question is why did they do it and this is something the second half of the film explores in depth it takes an hour and a half into the movie before the detectives catch up with the killers and begin the interrogation it s these final scenes that carry the most conviction and the most interest as the boys are told they ve made numerous mistakes and left a living witness the actual events up to and including the murder are saved until the end it makes no sense blake tells forsythe mr cutter was a very nice gentleman i thought so right up until the time i cut his throat the screenplay by richard brooks is concise and to the point and so is his direction summing up brilliant depiction of two aimless young men on a crime spree that made no sense then or now for a mere chilling
being that this movie has a lot of fine entertainment qualities i think it should some more credit than it has been given on imdb it s your basic who done it thriller with sex and murder but it keeps you guessing right to the end i like these kinds of movies and i certainly think this one meets the standard to me it was worth watching more than once so i ll give it an on imdb
homeward bound is a beautiful film y know the part where shadow falls down the ditch thingy i cried considering i was only six i cried it takes a lot to make me cry the dogs and the cat are excellently trained a nice family movie not for completely hardened non fluffy people or animal haters but could for soft as crap a k a people like me a good film overall
ok so soldier isn t deep and meaningful like blade runner or as big budget as terminator but on the whole i found it quite enjoyable the fact that kurt russell stayed in character not speaking and being virtually emotionless made the moments when his humanity broke through all the more poignant i found his portrayal of restricted emotional development more touching than arnie s in the t films and before i get comments yes i know that arnie was a cyborg and kurt was human but the premise put forward by both films was the same so to the film itself a reasonable us brit cast are able to flesh out this little story not really sure if gary busey and his two deputies were baddies or goodies so was unable to decide whether i liked them or not the colony was a little more realistic neither a misguided bunch of peace loving gullible cowardly hicks who get wiped out from the get go nor a group of subversive aggressive terrorists paranoid about offworlders and each other kurt russell is good and unlike other comments i do not feel this will have a negative impact on his career unlike maybe escape from la sequels are such fickle creatures sean pertwee has really done his late father proud by continuing the families noble sci fi lineage and the rest of the cast helped flesh out this pathetic band of people making the most of a bad situation and not doing too badly if you see this on your tv schedule i would recommend giving it a chance i don t think you will be disappointed
i pulled down a vhs box from my vast collection many unseen and picked out a movie based on the box art i thought would be fun and yes bad prison had that s cheesy look all over that box i sat down and watched and lo and behold found that sometimes we do indeed sit down to a movie with preconceived expectations in mind fortunately i reversed mine quickly and soon realized i was sitting down not just to an okay film but a rather good movie in total prison tells the story of an old dilapidated prison being reopened to save on budgetary concerns it looks creepy as all empty and filled with prisoners the prison used as a set is incredibly atmospheric and easily the most important character in the film the story using the prison as its central setting tells in a prologue of a man being killed via the electric chair we see lane smith as a guard tearing away a crucifix before sending the man to his maker we then go to present day first with a government board at a meeting deciding to open the prison and send a beautiful doctor in to make sure that conditions are acceptable as she campaigned vigorously against re opening the old prison then we see the new warden lane smith haunted by a nightmare in bed and given the new job of opening a prison he has not been to in years well the rest follows suit prisoners and guards arrive with plenty of stereotypes abounding we are given some character depth and several of the prisoners are interesting characters the acting is better than one might expect with lane smith doing as always a workmanlike job viggo mortenson as a very different prisoner being solid tom everett tiny lister and ivan kane really exploring the boundaries of their stereotypical characters chelsea field is okay as the female lead the best performance is by lincoln kilpatrick an underrated character actor as cresus a prisoner who had been in that very same prison years ago when the man had been executed with some kind of terrible secret prison is not the next best thing to sliced bread or anything like that but it is definitely worth a look and definitely better than most would expect from it i was pleasantly surprised at the way director renny harlin created a story so visually atmospheric the film has a tense taut pace and harlin knows how to build his scenes there are a few excessively shot gore scenes the one with the barbed wire was a bit much as was the one with all the pipes but these scenes are visually creative and interesting the acting is uniformly decent the script actually much more cohesive than one usually gets from films like these that may in part be credited to irwin yablans who wrote the story you may remember he came up with the idea of making halloween scary as a holiday here he makes incarceration a hell of a lot more scarier than it already is give prison a break get it
trailers of this movie may show scenes of violence or non mainstream sexuality but these scenes are just rare fragments picked out to attract audience they are of course showing the main message of the movie people who are constantly kicked on their heads in their jobs and lives using power which they may have somewhere else to notoriously oppress others and at the low end of the oppression chain mostly women a movie showing this as brutally as hundstage is surely tough to face but having to endure such lives is even tougher technically the film is much like short cuts but consisting of documentary style episodes featuring people like your neighbour playing just the way they are without any glitter and most disturbingly without any hope its documentary style makes the movie even more disturbing because you realize such people are out there and there are many of them although our society focuses on the nice exterior looks somewhere the porn industry has to do its business somewhere unreported domestic violence has to take place somewhere hopes have to shatter i sure do know such people if you want to see a movie without any funny scenes some may think the handicapped woman repeating the top ten supermarkets is funny but this happens for real and without any melodramatic go watch this movie however it will lose when you are focusing on subtitles i fear as subtitles can t transport accentuation
let me start by saying that war inc is not everyone s cup of tea it is however very enjoyable and gets you thinking oh crap the comedy involved the film isn t obvious at all it s quite subtle tamerlane tanks dry cleaning service etc and it changes with the twists turns in the plot i may be the only one but i won t compare this with grosse point blank because it s different john cusack i wouldn t say he was amazing or brilliant but he was good on the other hand his sister joan cusack was incredible in her delivery of lines comedic timing even though she was hardly in the film i d say the same about ben kingsley marisa tomei plays a convincing reporter and manages to pull it off hilary duff is very commendable for her role as central asian pop star yonica babyyeah duff s development as an actress is very noticeable in the film and she does a very good job even though her accent is a tad unreal overall the film is what i would call entertaining it doesn t have a particular storyline and it s quite silly at times but it does have a subtle message i d say it s worth a watch
laurence fishburne is a fine actor and deserves respect for trying this but he is not in a class with the great shakespeareans like olivier and welles and he further suffers from kenneth branagh this irishman always brilliant cleanly steals the show away olivier recognized that potential in his production and cast iago with someone he knew he could upstage i didn t nearly realize the possibilities of iago shakespeare s most evil character but branagh shows us the depths nice to see the views of venice too
this one is a great one robert de niro and cuba gooding have teamed up to make a powerful and very influential film this is the true story of the first black us navy diver and the obstacles he faced in attaining his certification at the hands of a racist master diver along the way he must also face plain old bigotry from all of his classmates none of whom want him in their class they move out of the barracks when he arrives ultimately he becomes certified and goes on to have a great career as a us navy diver watch this one it s a great tale of courage and honor as the story unfolds we get to watch racism slowly dissipate and everyone begins to respect men one at a time
fire and ice is an animated film set in a fantasy world the film is about a village that is destroyed by a giant glacier which is the home of the evil ice lord named nekron the only survivor of the village is a young man named larn who sets out to avenge those who were killed by the glacier the ice glacier moves through the land of fire and the princess of the land named teegra is kidnapped by evil creatures larn sets out to find her and also sets out to find and kill nekron fire and ice is directed by ralph bakshi who is one of my favourite adult animators he has brought us such animated masterpieces as the film version of fritz the cat and some films he has written himself like the great film heavy traffic i didn t like fire and ice nearly as much as i have ralph bakshi s other work but i still found the film to be enjoyable it had some very nice animation in parts and the story was entertaining enough the only basic complaints i have is that i wish that there was more of a story to the film because the story it uses is very thin and there is not a lot to it i also wish the film was a bit longer because it is under minutes in running time still it s an entertaining action adventure films that unlike fritz the cat or heavy traffic is appropriate for kids and older i only wish that there was a more developed story and it went on a bit longer than it did
i must admit the only reason i bought this movie was because i am a big fan of gackt and a huge fan of hyde i was expecting a good movie with a lot of shots that were shall we say pleasing to the feminine eye but a slightly cheesy story i mean the synopsis sounded really out there and now that i have just finished watching it i feel the need to tell the world of its brilliance hyde and gackt both gave heart wrenching performances and my eyes are still hot from the crying that lasted throughout the last half of the movie you get sucked into the story and you really feel for the characters by the end the element of vampirism which i love but is very easy to overdo or to ruin a movie with is subtly mixed into the storyline as to make it something merely exotic normal to this setting rather than a random unnecessary addition to the story i ranked it at a out of at first and then i went back and tried to think of why i wasn t giving it that last point came up with nothing so a ten out of ten it is after all i m not much of a critic the fact that i m bothering to write a review at all means i either really hate the movie or really love it you can tell what side i m on with moon child
in this film judy garland is deemed not to be ready for the big time yet by the man who loves her van heflin this film was certainly a big change for mr heflin especially after his supporting oscar win the year before in johnny eager wasn t spring byington too old to be the widowed mother of children with four of them appearing to look like her grandchildren the singing and dancing are just marvelously staged but the way that the blossoming romance between heflin and garland was depicted left a lot to be desired it was a gigi like one where a young girl is eventually swept off her feet by a charmer
great drama with all the areas covered except for screenlay which was too slow and should have shown more relevant scenes like pitt s character interviewing the president or pitt getting murdered instead of just having it described to us scenes like those would have kept the audience awake cutting away some useless minutes could have made more room for more heartpounding scenes like those the dragging of the film kept this one from all time greatness although to see pitt here makes the film so worth watching also big fans of fising early th century styles and montana will really like this as well
what starts out as a very predictable and somewhat drab affair is in the end quite hilarious and entertaining right to die is not very suspenseful but it more than makes up for that with some outlandish set pieces and over the top gore spoilers here top credits also go to the dead on performance from martin donovan as one of the most despicable characters ever to grace the screen playing the character in a great aloof fashion you nearly feel bad for the guy in the end when his grand plan ultimately fails corbin bernsen also chews up the scenery playing a not so good guy who gets his just desserts end of spoiler as a revenge from the dead flick right to die benefits heavily from it s performers and is more than an ok way to spend less than an hour
i was lucky enough to see this at a pre screening last night oct and i was incredibly surprised by the wonderful plot and genuinely heart felt acting while the plot is not particularly complicated or exceptionally new the story unfolds in a way that feels fresh unique and distinctly indy in style it isn t something that can easily be compared to films of the past it s a unique take on a sort of classic middle aged depressed love story i was particularly struck by the casting of the film down to every last extra in the family it was a beautiful and talented cast the three daughters did a wonderful job the talent was evenly dispersed between them and none of them out shone the other two it was truly a delightful film appropriate for all ages and laugh out loud funny while also being truly touching and heart warming it was a wonderful break from the sex jokes and nudity of recent films
this movie surprised me not ever having heard of hyde of gackt i was not expecting much the reason i wanted to watch this movie was because somebody mentioned that the movie contained some serious action scenes in john woo style normally i am very careful when this is claimed there is only one john woo and til this day there hasn t been one director that comes close to his brilliance when it comes to action the fact that moon child would feature a vampire convinced me even more how can you go wrong with gun blazing vampires sounds promising and interesting the first thing i noticed about this movie that the pace was considerably slow it takes it s time to set the mood this movie contains some nice hong kong style action scenes but moon child isn t an action movie it is a drama about friendship and loyalty the focus is on the characters and their relation to each other the pop singers hyde and gackt do a good job in acting and are very believable as friends the only problem i had was with the plot a couple of times the movie seems to skip a few years without explaining what happened and why they had to skip example when one member of the gang dies very dramatic moment alexander wang sees kei hyde drinking blood of one of the attackers without warning and explanation the movie skips nine years and most of the friends aren t together anymore also without a proper reason given son alexander wang and sho gackt have to kill each other i know that this is done to add some serious drama because of the actors it is very effective but sometimes it does feel forced apart from the flaws in plot this movie has an ambiance and slickness that makes it hard not to like this movie it is hard to explain why this movie is wonderful but it just is the overall experience you get is heartwarming and sincere
the person s comment that said that pat robertson is evil and his program is evil has nothing to compare what evil and righteous is his definition of evil is the opposite of evil the bible itself says that in the last days people will call good evil and evil good he doesn t even know that he fulfilled bible prophecy if you don t know god and refuse to know him now that s okay he still loves you but when you do finally bow your knee to him and you will it will be too late for you god sends no one to hell not even you you will go there of your own decision and your spewing defines it may god have mercy on you and give you a damascus road experience the club and pat robertson s ministry is one of the reasons i m still here on the edge of alcoholism adultery and probably death god reached through the tv screen and used pat robertson to do it and thank god he did you have a right to say what you said but you don t have a right to curse with your words god have mercy on you
first of all the only reason people keep bitching about this film is because they can t stand a few parts of the true story being altered well guess what peter jackson s film wasn t a perfect rendition either well enough ranting this is a very beautiful film the backgrounds are gorgeous and taken from well known tolkein artists the film covers about half the trilogy fellowship of the ring and up to the battle of helms deep in the two towers and moves at a good pace the voice casting is top notch and the most of the characters look like i imagined they would samwise is a bit too ugly for my tastes but aragorn looks awesome the film has a great score that completely supports the movie if you enjoy good fantasy stories but hate reading the books are even better give this movie a try keeping in mind it was made odd years ago also of particular note peter jackson s adaption of fellowship follows almost exactly the same strand as ralph bakshi s jackson has said many times how much he admired bakshi s effort
comedies often have the unfortunate reputation of having little real depth arms and the man proves that notion to be false shaw s play is full of comedic drama combining an entertaining plot with true philosophical depth on one level arms and the man is a successful and somewhat unique romantic comedy the young melodramatic and superficial raina comes from a military family deeply involved in a war her fianc and her father are both military officers she is shocked one night by the arrival of an enemy soldier she rescues him knowing that she ll have to keep the incident a secret from her family forever and the soldier eventually leaves of course once the war is over that soldier comes back forcing each of the primary characters to reevaluate their values and their relationships it is quite interesting how shaw layers meaning within the rather standard comedic plot shaw manages to comment on class constructs on the absurdity of war and even on the nature of love and of course he does this with the shavian wit and within a satisfying plot there is so much here to think about that i think a lot can be missed in a single viewing arms and the man is excellent comedic theater and is definitely one of shaw s best works arms and the man is both an amusing and thought provoking movie that retains its relevance even today more than a century after it was first conceived shaw mocks at the popular theories on war and love and combines a military satire with a taunt on love and family structure the play has flashing wit buoyant humor and bitter sarcasms a good example of shaw s dialog is the statement by captain bluntschli to serguis i m a professional soldier i fight when i have to and am very glad to get out of it when i haven t to you re only an amateur you think fighting is an amusement indeed as a swiss hotel keeper s son bluntschli had no reason to be involved in war and it is in this absurdity that shaw questions patriotic sentiments shaw explores the whole concept of war and the military from both sides of the struggle and in the end shows that the feelings in both camps are not that different the dialog and sarcasm used towards the common notions of life are entangled with a gentle assurance of the movement of the story towards a fairytale ending the end where all characters are rendered happy and lovers change and love shifts is what underlines the essence of this drama as a comedy this is a movie that sustains its image of possessing a universal appeal and is still appropriate today when the concepts of war and patriotism and love and marriage have changed dramatically shaw s arms and the man should maintain its relevance as long as there is love and war
this is yet another gritty and compelling film directed by sam fuller in the early s this minimalist and fast working director has something unusual for his earlier films a cast with some stars richard widmark jean peters and richard kiley star in this film about a group of communist agents who are trying to sneak secrets out of america and they ll stop at nothing to succeed the film starts with peters on a subway car being watched by federal agents they know she is a link in a long espionage chain unknown to everyone is the wild card in the equation a small time pickpocket widmark is also on the train and he manages to steal the secrets that peters is carrying widmark thinks it s just another purse he s ransacked only later does he realize the seriousness of what he s stolen now it s widmark on his own with commies and the fbi hot on his trail widmark and the rest are exceptional and the film is gripping from start to finish although she didn t get top billing a special mention should be made of thelma ritter this supporting actress had perhaps the performance of her lifetime as a stool pigeon seldom was she given this much of a chance to act and i was impressed by her ability to play a broken down and sad old lady as far as the script and directing go they are very good but with one small exception at first i loved the way widmark and peters interacted it s one of the few times on film you ll see a woman punched square in the mouth now that s tough later inexplicably they become amazingly close too close to be believable still with so much great drama and such an effective noir like film this can be overlooked see this film
several posters have quoted renoir voicing his desire to make a film showing ingrid bergman smiling to camera the short answer is wouldn t we all whilst the harsh reality is that only a select few got to do so at this stage of her career bergman couldn t get arrested in she left hollywood to make a picture in europe fell for director roberto rossellini and never looked forward after five turkeys in italy she was probably ready to open a vein but within the year after making this for renoir she was back where she belonged and with an oscar to boot for anastasia this is one of three movies that renoir made in color around this time and on balance it s better than the golden coach which isn t hard and about even with french can can renoir probably figured that with so much going for her bergman could get away with a couple of wooden leading men and renoir picked two doozys in jean marais and mel ferrer solid mahogany in both cases the plot is actually based on a real incident in french history but renoir is content to give it a once over lightly and concentrate on replicating the paintings of his father in set up after set up in its pastel colors it resembles another film of the period les grandes manouvres which is no bad thing all in all it remains a pleasant trifle showcasing a beautiful and charismatic actress
i saw this film as it was the second feature on a disc containing the previously banned video nasty blood rites as blood rites was entirely awful i really wasn t expecting much from this film but actually it would seem that trash director andy milligan has outdone himself this time as seeds of sin tops blood rites in style and stands tall as a more than adequate slice of sick sixties sexploitation the plot is actually quite similar to blood rites as we focus on a dysfunctional family unit and of course there is an inheritance at stake the film is shot in black and white and the look and feel of it reminded me a lot of the trash classic the curious dr humpp there s barely any gore on display and the director seems keener to focus on sex with themes of incest and hatred seeping through the acting is typically trashy but most of the women get to appear nude at some point and despite a poor reputation director andy milligan actually seems to have an eye for this sort of thing as many of the sequences in this film are actually quite beautiful the plot is paper thin and most of the film is filler but the music is catchy and the director also does a surprisingly good job with the sex scenes themselves as most are somewhat erotic overall this is not a great film but it s likely to appeal to the cult fan and gets a much higher recommendation than the better known and lower quality blood rites
turned out to be a classy production with what must have been a low budget the variety of characters is amazing from axe wielding dwarfs to ft ghouls i enjoyed the relationship between the leads not overly sentimental but romantic enough to keep the interest going i also enjoyed the mix of humour which can be very easy to get wrong too much not enough which meant it didn t get too dark nor too spoofy it was a great step up from eaves other efforts hellbreeder and sanitarium in terms of storyline and production they have a great website which is worth checking out can t wait for bane if the level of improvement continues it should be fantastic
david burton richard chamberlain quite good is a lawyer more adept at handling corporate taxation and suffers from unusual dreams which bother him seeing this aboriginal man shrouded in darkness who is called on to take a case concerning a group of aboriginals charged with the murder of one of their own named billy we see that he tries to steal stones with ritual painting on them and is killed when a leader of an aboriginal tribe named charlie nandjiwarra amagula uses a death bone to stop his heart meanwhile revolving around david bizarre weather patterns effect sydney such as rain beating down polluted dirt and rock sized hail during bright blue skies with no sights of clouds such as the one that hits a school in central australia not to mention a deformed rainbow which is split into groups as david pursues the case he finds that he is far closer to the weird events taking place than he could ever realize one aboriginal named chris david gulpilil appears to him in a dream holding a stone with blood and he finds that this man is one of those he is to represent at trial he finds that it s quite possible after some strange meetings with charlie and conversations with chris that he very well might be linked to a spirit named mulkurul and that his dreams are actual premonitions of possible horrors yet to come absorbing apocalyptic drama builds it s story methodically and is completely original and unpredictable with peter weir in charge the film is visually arresting as we see these very overwhelming images of possible doom towards civilization but the film s most compelling angle is certainly david s journey to find that monumental truth that plagues him as he questions charlie and chris countlessly at first to help his men get off from a crime they didn t commit and ultimately to find out what he has to do with anything catastrophic that is occurring or might occur later
i for one was glad to see jim carrey in a film where being over the top wasn t the goal his character is like all of us wanting more better things to happen to us and expecting god to deliver morgan freeman made a great god with a sense of humor and a genuine sense of love for each of us yet ready to take a little vacation when the opportunity presents itself i thought jennifer aniston s character was a little too vulnerable and understanding towards carry s basically self centered tv anchorman wanna be but that s the way it was written i think the previews ruined several potentially very funny scenes because everyone who saw them knew what was coming before it happened i have read a number of the reviews and it seems some people are looking a little too deep this is a summer comedy and is not meant to solve the problems of the world although there are a few messages we could all take to heart a funny film
the movie actually has a fairly good story but gets bogged down in several key places it s almost as if the director threw the movie together without taking the time to make some essential cuts in the film dennis quaid does a fairly decent job in his role but something is clearly missing from several key scenes this hour movie could have been reduced to about a hour movie and probably would have been a much better film had it not had the feel as if it was thrown together
the third and last part of the bourne trilogy duh is lacking a bit in the story department but covers it with extensive action scenes twi in particular take up quite some of the running time and make this movie better the director and star damon themselves agreed that it was difficult to find a story for the last part because the end of the second movie was quite advanced story wise how they got around that the action scenes for once but they did another thing too which i can t reveal because that would be a spoiler but if you watch the movie than you ll notice it funnily enough i read that this adaptation of the bourne books is the least accurate of all three films if that means anything to you o
dirty sanchez is the more extreme british version of jackass in which the four boys pritchard dainton joycey and pancho go to great lengths to hurt and humiliate each other the reason this show is better than jackass is because most of the stunts are not planned which makes the reaction much more funny there are series of the show the first follows them around and takes a long look at their lives eg there s an episode on their love lives jobs etc the second series sends the boys to try out different occupations the third follows their european tour it seems that the boys get more and more daring as the show progresses through the series in my opinion the third series is the best but trust me when i say if you have a week stomach do not watch as you are lightly to see a fair amount of blood and puke in every episode
i enjoyed this movie as a kid when it came out and to this day still do a simple story involving the search for a kidnapped girl and an adventurer literally straight out of paperback lore it has actors that were more recognizable back in the day this shouldn t keep the viewer from giving it a whirl wayne crawford stars as the main character jake speed sure it might bite from certain elements of romancing the stone and indiana jones but this movie is done well enough to keep it out of the cellar i am surprised not too many people know about it it must have been overshadowed by other movies in the theaters back in i watched it back then on cable tv it might be hard to find since it s out of print on both vhs and dvd i managed to get a dvd from ebay at less than bucks cool flick
show people is an absolutely delightful silent directed by king vidor and starring marion davies and billy haines what gems both of them are in this charming comedy about a young girl peggy pepper whose acting is the talk of savannah trying to make it on the big screen though she s a success in comedy what she wants to do is make art so she moves up to high arts studio soon she becomes patricia pepoire and is too good for the likes of her friend billy many stars of the silent era have cameos in show people including davies herself without the curly hair and makeup i m sure when people saw the film in they recognized everyone who appeared in the elaborate lunch scene sadly nowadays it s not the case even for film buffs in one part of the film however she does meet charlie chaplin in another author elinor glyn is pointed out to her and vidor himself has a cameo at the end of the film other stars who pop up in show people are john gilbert douglas fairbanks william s hart leatrice joy bess flowers renee adoree rod laroque aileen pringle and many others davies was adorable and a lively comedienne it s a shame william haines quit the movies he was cute and energetic deservedly an enormous star back in the day show people is a simple story told in a witty way it s also a look back at an exciting era in hollywood s history and contains performances by two wonderful stars
barbra streisand is a tour de force in this hollywood story her performances and the songs are one of a kind and are special in the halls of great movies the scene where she is introduced to the unexpecting audience by kristopherson against the crowds wishes and hers only to turn them around with her magnificent performance of woman in the moon is one of the best examples on film of how well a great performer can win over an audience it s real the scene where she records evergreen ranks with the best in the business all live no lip sync very special streisand is often criticized for being a diva but she delivers on this one she is majestic singing with one more look at you she deserved the oscar she and paul williams got for evergreen kristopherson had his moments too far above most of his movie appearances this version of the born franchise ranks with the first one of janet gaynor frederic march although i will always enjoy judy garland and james mason musical remake of i haven t seen the dvd yet and don t know about its quality
monty berman and dennis spooner followed up the baron with this a fantasy series about three superhuman spies which preempted the six million dollar man it was a favourite of mine when i was a youngster and i enjoy watching it still stuart damon and william gaunt had an unmistakable on screen chemistry as craig stirling and richard barrett while the luscious alexandra bastedo pouted her way through her role as sharron macready the late anthony nicholls made a wonderfully gruff tremayne by far the best episodes were those written by tony williamson terry nation and brian clemens while spooner s own the interrogation compared favourably with the prisoner i regret that there was never a second series the concept had so much life left in it would craig and richard have been competitors for sharron s affections what if tremayne had learned of the champions powers did the champions have any other abilities other than those we saw we never found out alas
who loves the sun works its way through some prickly subject matter with enough wit and grace to keep the story not only engaging but often hilarious it s been a while since i ve found such a thoroughly touching thoroughly enjoyable film the film is gorgeous drawing the eye with beautiful scenery and tranquil landscapes the peaceful imagery contrasts wonderfully with the tension between the very human very flawed and yet very likable characters due to the excellent cast all five of the major players are wonderfully interesting and dynamic i recommend who loves the sun it s a really funny movie that takes a poignant look at the hurts that we can inflict on each other and the amazingly difficult but equally rewarding process of forgiveness
hey babu riba is a film about a young woman mariana nicknamed esther after a famous american movie star and four young men glenn sacha kicha and pop all perhaps years old in belgrade yugoslavia the five are committed friends and crazy about jazz blue jeans or anything american it seems the very close relationship of the teenagers is poignant and ultimately a sacrifice is willingly made to try to help one of the group who has fallen on unexpected difficulties in the wake of changing communist politics they go their separate ways and reunite in the year before the film was made i enjoyed the film with some reservations the subtitles for one thing were difficult especially in the beginning there were a number of dialogues which had no subtitles at all perhaps the conversational pace required it but i couldn t always both read the text and absorb the scene which caused me to not always understand which character was involved i watched the movie a video from our public library with a friend and neither of us really understood part of the story about acquiring streptomycin for a sick relative this yugoslavian coming of age film effectively conveyed the teenagers sense of invulnerability idealism and strong and loyal bonds to each other there is a main flashforward and it was intriguing keeping me guessing until the end as to who these characters were vis a vis the cast and what had actually happened i would rate it out of and would like to see other films by the director jovan acin
buster keaton was finding his feature length voice in three ages there are some fine sequences but it doesn t quite hang together the chariot race in three ages is hilarious included are shorts one of which the goat is excellent
a river runs through it is one of those movies that deserves to be seen in the theater so that the majesty of its cinematography can be truly appreciated the acting is wonderful and understated with every gesture and smile and nod carrying meaning brad pitt gives a radiant performance and tom skerrit is powerful as the preacher father the movie moves like a river you have to be willing to follow it through ebbs and flows but it is well worth it in the end
the title of this film nearly put me off watching it not being a manchester united fan the mere mention of beckham was a bit off putting however i put my prejudices behind me and i m glad i did i wasn t expecting much of a film but i was pleasantly surprised the film sped along with me never looking at my watch and i enjoyed every second of the film if you liked east is east then you ll love this film ok so the storyline is nothing new and the classic storylines are contained within the film but it s all done very funnily and with a breath of fresh air the film moves very fast and keeps the audiance entertained the occaisional funny moments are a good chuckle and not some poor attempt at humour and best of all it s a good british comedy
french horror cinema has seen something of a revival over the last couple of years with great films such as inside and switchblade romance bursting on to the scene mal fique preceded the revival just slightly but stands head and shoulders over most modern horror titles and is surely one of the best french horror films ever made mal fique was obviously shot on a low budget but this is made up for in far more ways than one by the originality of the film and this in turn is complimented by the excellent writing and acting that ensure the film is a winner the plot focuses on two main ideas prison and black magic the central character is a man named carr re sent to prison for fraud he is put in a cell with three others the quietly insane lassalle body building transvestite marcus and his retarded boyfriend daisy after a short while in the cell together they stumble upon a hiding place in the wall that contains an old journal after translating part of it they soon realise its magical powers and realise they may be able to use it to break through the prison walls black magic is a very interesting topic and i m actually quite surprised that there aren t more films based on it as there s so much scope for things to do with it it s fair to say that mal fique makes the best of it s assets as despite it s restraints the film never actually feels restrained and manages to flow well throughout director eric valette provides a great atmosphere for the film the fact that most of it takes place inside the central prison cell ensures that the film feels very claustrophobic and this immensely benefits the central idea of the prisoners wanting to use magic to break out of the cell it s very easy to get behind them it s often said that the unknown is the thing that really frightens people and this film proves that as the director ensures that we can never really be sure of exactly what is round the corner and this helps to ensure that mal fique actually does manage to be quite frightening the film is memorable for a lot of reasons outside the central plot the characters are all very interesting in their own way and the fact that the book itself almost takes on its own character is very well done anyone worried that the film won t deliver by the end won t be disappointed either as the ending both makes sense and manages to be quite horrifying overall mal fique is a truly great horror film and one of the best of the decade highly recommended viewing
gentleman jim is another case of print the legend with errol flynn playing the legendary boxer as a brash but charismatic social climber in a rollicking entertainment that barely stops for breath it s as pointless looking for historical accuracy here as it is in flynn s the charge of the light brigade this is sheer hokum with all the stops pulled out filmed on a surprisingly lavish scale and given a real sense of energy by raoul walsh s vivid direction flynn is still at the height of his powers you d never guess he suffered a mild heart attack during the production with alexis smith a beautiful romantic sparring partner and perpetual sidekick alan hale along for good measure this time as flynn s father jack carson takes sidekick duties this time indeed even the pirate galleon from flynn s earlier movies makes a somewhat out of place cameo in a dockside bout the minutes just breeze by
and i ll tell you why whoever decided to edit this movie to make it suitable for television was very ill advised everything concerning drugs is cut out and covered up how do they do it you might ask well they don t do it very well that s for sure anyway instead of the marijuana which cheech and chong are supposed to have in their possession they are said to have diamonds still the characters go around in a haze of marijuana smoke stoning others along their way with no explanation whatsoever
master director ching siu tung s perhaps most popular achievement is this series a chinese ghost story chinese ghost story stars leslie cheung in some distant past in china as a tax collector who is forced to spend a night during his collecting trip in a mysterious castle in which some strange old warriors fight and meet him beautiful actress joey wang wong is the ghost who lives in that castle and is under a domination of one powerful demon a wood devil who collects human souls for herself itself with the help of her beautiful ghosts leslie and joey fall in love and even though ghosts are not allowed to live with humans they decide to break that rule and live happily together for the rest of their lives this is not what the wood devil thinks and our protagonists have to fight for their lives and their happiness this film is no less full of magic than other films by ching siu tung his masterpieces include duel to the death and the swordsman series which all have incredible visuals and kinetic power in their action scenes ghost story is full of brilliant lightning and dark atmosphere which is lightened by the strong presence of the beautiful and good willing ghost the effects are simply breath taking and would work at their greatest power in the big screen the camera is moving and twisted all the time and it adds to the fairy tale atmosphere this film has there s plenty of wire fu stunts too and even though some think they are and look gratuitous or stupid when used in films i cannot agree and think they give motion pictures the kind of magic freedom and creativeness any other tool could not give when people fly in these films it means the films are not just about our world and they usually depict things larger than life with the power of this larger than life art form the story about the power of love is pretty touching and warm but the problem is again that the characters are little too shallow and act unexplainably occasionally leslie and joey should have been written with greater care and their characters should be even more warm deep and genuine in order to give the story a greater power and thus make the film even more noteworthy and important achievement also the message about love and power of it is underlined little too much at one point and it should have been left just to the viewer s mind to be interpreted and found another negative point about the dialogue is that it s too plenty and people talk in this film without a reason that is very irritating and sadly shows the flaws many scriptwriters tend to do when they write their movies people just talk and talk and it s all there just to make everything as easy to understand as possible and so the film is not too challenging or believable as it has this gratuitous element just think about the films of the japanese film maker takeshi kitano his films have very little dialogue and all there is is all the necessary as he tells his things by other tools of cinema and never talks or makes other characters talk too much in his movies this is just the talent the writers should have in order to write greater scripts otherwise chinese ghost story is very beautiful and visually breath taking piece of eastern cinema and also the song that is played in the film is very beautiful and hopefully earned some award in the hong kong film awards back then i give chinese ghost story and without the flaws mentioned above this would without a doubt be almost perfect masterpiece of the fantasy genre
i m fond of this film and it vexes me that so many reviewers rank it below the peter jackson trilogy a filmed novel is always interpretive in particular an animated film relies on the artist s vision and should be judged on its own terms speaking as a purist this is a finer homage to tolkien than the updated version while this film has its flaws it stays truer to the source especially so far as the characters are concerned in the jackson version tolkien s frodo is barely recognizable from the first scenes he is portrayed as a weakling constantly wavering manipulated by forces around him and never standing on his own two feet this is physically and metaphorically true you wonder why fate chose this limp biscuit to carry the one ring to the cracks of doom jackson unforgivably rewrites tolkien and robs frodo of his finest moment when he allows arwen to rescue him from the ringwraiths bakshi s version respects the original presenting a frodo who demands the wraiths go back and trouble me no more bakshi sustains frodo s character as tolkien conceived it we see his decline as the weight of his burden increases frodo is so pivotal to lord of the rings you wonder why jackson took such liberties he does so with numerous characters since character development propels the plot to its inevitable conclusion bakshi s film better explores the companionship between legolas and gimli in a few judicious scenes that are completely lacking in jackson s version similarly we see boromir horsing with pippin and merry furthering the idea of fellowship for my liking the camaraderie is more developed in the animated version than the live action tolkien s poetry is an important ingredient in the novels and bakshi makes tribute to this in one of my favorite scenes when frodo sings the merry old inn song minutes before stumbling into strider the cheery tune is chillingly juxtaposed with the darker theme music when seconds later invisible to his friends but visible to the wraiths frodo is dangerously exposed this is one of the most atmospheric portions of the film and chills me whenever i see it the well documented budget time restrictions limit this film s final impact but had it been completed it may have resonated with more viewers as it is it s worth a look even its detractors admit that peter jackson derived much of his inspiration from this prototype
tarzan and his mate released viewed john dillinger escapes from prison and robs a bank in iowa bonnie clyde kill two highway patrolman in texas births ralph nader gloria steinem alan arkin richard chamberlain doug after we were rather disappointed with the original tarzan the ape man we discovered among fellow users and historians that the second film tarzan and his mate was the best in the series it s true i got a huge kick out of this movie johnny weismuller returns as the titular vine swinging animal dueling wild super hero and maureen o sullivan reprises her role as his entirely fantastic lady love jane who sports a two piece outfit for the first and last time here in my review for ape man i stomped on jane pretty good for her obsession with clothes and her incessant screaming but she s redeemed herself for me here make no mistake o sullivan is the star of this movie and jane is the most capable character in the entire cast she acts as the ambassador between holt and tarzan she can function perfectly in the jungle and get along with the animals and she knows how to hold off an angry pride of lions when she s out of bullets she s even got her own jungle scream now the chemistry between johnny and maureen is irresistible she s totally got him trained cheeta is quite charming as well taking drags off of martin s cigarette the plot is mostly an excuse for tarzan to do battle with the jungle s most vicious animals especially lions crocodiles and rhinos the effects though always visible are much more dynamic and cool and complement the action nicely oh and you can t talk about this movie without talking about the nude swimming scene all i can say is yes she is naked very exciting stuff kevin wow just wow when it comes to down and dirty pre code action adventure nothing holds a candle to tarzan and his mate the inevitable sequel to tarzan the ape man is a kick ass violent and risqu jungle epic i doubt there will be another tarzan movie in the future that takes no prisoners the way this one does you d be hard pressed to find a full scene in this movie that would be code approved or animal rights approved for that matter the gruesome violence doesn t even wait for the happy jungle couple to show up before it pushes even the limits of today s adventure movies and after t j enter the picture there s plenty of early morning cuddling and ass naked afternoon swims see it for yourself if you don t believe me i love maureen o sullivan most of all in this film in the first film jane seemed like a walking contradiction like the writers back then just didn t know how to portray a character like that but here she is a great precursor to kick butt females of later cinema although she still requires tarzan s assistance in getting her out of most jams she does a lot more than just waiting around to be rescued her personality is perfectly believable for a woman who has been living relatively comfortably in the jungle for a year i watched this with my mom and i enjoyed pointing out to her just how much jane has tarzan trained as jeff foxworthy put it she totally has the ape man at her every beck and call although there is a host of dated optical effects throughout the film there is still plenty of hair raising tarzan vs predator battles that are performed mostly for real that and the men dressed as apes are a lot more convincing this time around spoiler the film climaxes as the jungle erupts with a shocking orgy of animal kingdom violence that leaves tarzan and jane the only two humans still breathing although the couple rides off into the sunset reunited and victorious i can t help but imagine how this story will seem to the next safari who will hear about the previous bunch of humans who went to find tarzan and jane and were never heard from again end spoiler one of things that still bothers me is johnny weissmuller s smooth hairless bod and over styled coif other than that this is pre code action adventure that is absolutely not to be missed last film it happened one night next film twentieth century
i really can t remember who recommended this but they said it was one of their favorite films it is certainly a strange one like rubbernecking at a highway accident someone said that truth is stranger than fiction and the truth here is something to see i really can t understand how a fictionalized account of this documentary is to be released this year how can you improve on this the aunt and cousin of jackie kennedy remove themselves from new york society and hide in the hampton s in the process they become recluses and what is best described as crazy cat ladies they would have stayed hidden had not the city move to condemn the property for the filth and the subsequent rescue by jackie this film was done after that rescue all during you couldn t help but think how bad was it before it s a look at high society from the darker side and it is utterly fascinating
this is movie is very touching i don t care what people say about this movie this is a very good movie the performances by amitabh bachchan s role has the dying father is great because he wants to teach his son how to handle life in case something happens to him and akshay kumer was great in his role as the spoiled aditya thakur the supporting role of shefali shetty who played the role of sumitra thakur was magnificent priyanka chopra was good in her small role she had in the movie ragpal yadav as the brain dead servant and boman irani as the show off father in law have a very good connection and the comedy scene s were hilarious the direction is very good
i do find it a bit overrated maybe it s just because i ve never seen a subtitled version dubbing stinks but i just don t get into it like a lot of other people do the finale is really great though as jackie trashes a mall a scene that plays in my head every time i go shopping
the only reason i m giving this a is that the other kid actors who played tadashi s tormentors were not up to the job i presume they were just kids who happened to be the right age and handy but they were not well coached and their scenes were a minor annoyance i say not to judge this by u s standards because it s full of ambiguities and the kinds of equivocations that japanese culture readily embraces and is not beholden to the black hat white hat moral constraints u s kids films are routinely subjected to for example there is a preciously funny moment when tadashi s small band of yokai companions finds themselves let down and abandoned by the other yokai and shojo the avuncular kirin herald does what many a stressed out japanese adult would do hint this would not happen in a disney film this picture also has the best product placement for beer you will ever see in a kids movie early on there s a moment where a school teacher smacks a couple of bullies on the head with her attendance book there was a tv commercial in japan a couple years before this movie came out it was a stop motion clay animation about a kid who s depressed and playing guitar and singing the blues in his room his mother yells at him from downstairs to shut up then someone gives him a candy bar and he cheers up and sings a happy tune but his mother comes in and tells him to shut up again and gives him a dope slap that leaves a dent in his forehead i mention this commercial because it was considered funny and i didn t hear any objections to it while i was there there is a lot more bloodshed and physical cruelty on screen in the great yokai war than one would find in a disney movie as a parent if this were a u s film i would be up in arms about such things although not necessarily the moral lessons drawn at the end of the picture which of course are also not black and white since it s a japanese movie i accept that those cultural norms allow for imagery that would not get past the standards and practices cops in a u s production however i d probably be a little uneasy taking young kids to see it without giving them some sort of pre show briefing and or post show debriefing about the violence and other off color stuff or i d wait till they re older to show it to them
as with all environmentally aware films from the s soylent green has a rather cheesy view of what ecological meltdown is overpopulation means there s too many people to feed i was under the impression that famines were caused by either war or failed economic policies stalin s policy in the soviet union in the s left millions dead because of famine and to this day the greatest man made tragedy was mao s rural policy in china which led over million starvation deaths in the s and let s not forget the great famines in the horn of africa in the s and s which were to do with conflicts not overpopulation you might like to also consider that two of the most heavily populated areas on earth hong kong and macau have never suffered a famine in modern times likewise the expansion of shanty towns around cities as seen here isn t strictly down to overpopulation it s down to economic factors where people flock to cities to find better paid work than in the countryside it s a symptom of industrial progress not of too many births so the image of the streets of new york city being too congested to walk through and of having people sleep in stairwells is somewhat laughablebut don t be fooled into thinking soylent green is a pile of corny tree hugging crap because i consider this to be the best ecological film of the s it plays on the contempary audience s knowledge of the world where sol and thorn are beside themselves with joy at finding fruit brandy and fresh meat thorn gasps in amazement at having ice in his whisky puffs on a cigarette and delivers the classic line if i could afford it i d smoke two maybe three of these a day but it s the visage of the euthanasia chamber that s memorable as thorn gazes at the images of wild animals flowers running water and snow covered mountains a world thorn s generation has never known this is a very haunting scene which makes soylent green a very memorable film combined with the fact it features the final screen appearance of edward g robinson as the wise old jew sol roth
i did no research on the film prior to my first viewing of it because it was part of a welles box set i had recently purchased a box set i chiefly got because i wanted to own a man for all seasons and to also re evaluate waterloo so i stick orson and rita in the player and i m treated to class and confusion in equal measure on the surface the story seemed a simple one man meets gorgeous woman and saves her from a couple of thugs they click straight away and man gets offer of work on a cruise with woman and her famous lawyer husband and then well it becomes murder mystery of plotted devilment and much shenanigans michael o hara orson welles himself doesn t really know what is going on he is as confused as the viewer is and that is wonderful to watch as he is pulled all over the place by pretty much everyone in the film obviously being pulled by the heart strings by a femme fatale of such beauty as elsa bannister rita hayworth has its moments but you just know that things are going to go pear shaped so many wonderful things in the film it has welles visual style all over it see a scene in an aquarium that is marvellous and the ending sequences in a fun house is majestic on the eye the narration from o hara is joyously self mocking and we get good light relief by way of a court case with everett sloane considerably lighting up proceedings yet the film is an oddity and in fact it s a choppy viewing experience because as i was to find out after studio bosses cut the film by pretty much a whole hour and that is just not only frustrating to us the viewer but unfair on welles vision i m positive that a full original cut of this film would have been lauded and revered wholesale as it is tho we have a very good and intriguing film one that sadly only hints at greatness but remains a fiendishly engrossing film that i m glad i own to revisit further
all the world s a stage and its people actors in it or something like that who the hell said that theatre stopped at the orchestra pit or even at the theatre door why is not the audience participants in the theatrical experience including the story itself this film was a grand experiment that said hey the story is you and it needs more than your attention it needs your active participation sometimes we bring the story to you sometimes you have to go to the story alas no one listened but that does not mean it should not have been said
citizen x tells the story of andrei chikatilo the ripper of rostov who killed people in years time mainly women and children it shows how the investigation was obstructed by soviet bureaucracy how hard it was to investigate the crimes it does the job in such a brilliant way that it will leave no one untouched in the beginning it s perhaps a little bit slow of pace but it really grabs you as the story unfolds i can only say that next to the silence of the lambs this is by far the best movie about a serial killer i ve ever seen it is very hard to say which actor s performance stands out above the rest in this movie stephen rea is really brilliant as the inexperienced forensic expert who is put in charge of the investigation donald sutherland s performance as his cynical superior and the only person in the russian government willing to help him is as outstanding as rea s and what to say about jeffrey dumann playing the serial killer dumann brilliantly created a character who inspires empathy rather than hatred yes he is a monster but he is also a sad figure oppressed and ridiculed by his wife his boss his co workers he is tortured ashamed as well as extremely vicious i can only recommend this movie to everybody who s interested in a well made docu drama where the actors are still more important than the special effects it deserves at least a perhaps even more if you ask me
i attended camp chesapeake it was located at the head of the chesapeake bay on the north east river in md it was a similar type summer camp with cabins it was established by the coatesville pa ymca i started out as a young camper and later became a junior senior counselor and later the waterfront director if the camp had continued i would have done anything within my power to become the camp director alas the powers of the ymca decided to close down the camp and sell it to the state of md i visited the former camp some years later by boat and was dismayed by the neglect of the state of md and natural destruction by mother nature the acre site served so many with all the benefits of contact with natures offerings a black man by the name of curtis ford and his family were residents and caretakers of the property mr curtis was my friend and mentor i idolized his every being even as he could not swim he was a waterman if i asked him where the fish were biting he would designate the spot and i would have a ball ther was also a family camp at the end of the summer these memories will be with me for eternity
this movie is definately one of my favorite movies in it s kind the interaction between respectable and morally strong characters is an ode to chivalry and the honor code amongst thieves and policemen it treats themes like duty guilt word manipulation and trust like few films have done and unfortunately none that i can recall since the death of the policial in the late seventies the sequence is delicious down to the essential living nothing out and thus leading the spectator into a masterful plot right and wrong without accessory eye catching and spectacular scenes that are often needed in lesser specimens of the genre in order to keep the audience awake no such scenes are present or needed the argument is sand honest to the spectator an important asset in a genre that too often achieve suspense through the deception of the audience no this is not miss marble a note of congratulations for the music is in order a film to watch and savor every minute not just to see
i have zero interest rap and in ghetto culture i m white and like classic rock however that did not stop me from appreciating this fantastic comedy its pretty much a sequel of this is spinal tap in the sense that it is the same movie just about rap instead or rock yet it s hilarious there are many funny jokes but not without a few jokes that just fall flat the characters are all very funny and believable i watched just because it made me laugh at a m and any movie that can do that warrants at least a test screening one of the reasons why this movies was so funny was that it makes fun of rap from a different rap today is concerned with the wrong things and get by with studio noise and little talent this movie comes from a time where rappers deserved more credit overall it s a funny movie with many jokes about racism sex and music culture among the more obvious themes of humor this is highly recommend for any fan of this is spinal tap they are essentially the same movie just about different worlds and yes the same jokes work in both movies
after going for a bike ride that day lying beside a lake in a nature reserve spending half an hour feeding and talking to a donkey who lived in a beautiful field with a small wood in it this film made absolute sense to me the imagery of the film was beautiful and that is all you need switch off the conscious control knob of the mind and job done reminded me of baraka but with the added lesson of my previous paragraph this comment requires a minimum of ten lines ten lines is the minimum not lines but ten after finishing counting all the lines you realise that there are less than ten even though less than ten lines is all that is needed to make my comment
govind nihalani s directorial venture of vijay tendulkar s novel is brilliant om puri plays an inspector velankar who is forced to protect underworld don rama shetty played brilliantly by sadahiv amrapurkar this is govind nihlan s most talked about movie this is a very good and a classic film smita patil plays the female lead opposite om puri naseeruddin shah is brilliant in a cameo role although sadashiv amrapurkar has only scenes in the movie he dominates the movie this was sadashiv amrapurkars acting debut om puri won a national award for this film for the best actor filmfare award winner for best film story supporting actor sadashiv amrapurkar
an inventive suspenseful exercise in claustrophobia a japanese thriller that sets itself a tough challenge by being entirely set in two rooms not completely successful but taut surprising and well acted one might find the film somewhat reminiscent of saw two men trapped in room and pitting against each other but unlike that film it dares to stay with its premise and keep the hero locked in his cell throughout the film it s like watching a lab experiment some might find the contained suspense tedious but this reviewer found it enthralling the sound and imagery of the film are stunningly well realized this is a certainly a good film to use to show off a good home video system just right for a late night movie fest when one is in the paranoid mood it certainly kept me awake that night
most horror movies are in fact horrible movies they get to be same ol same ol same ol pack every minute with some cheap thrill usually splatter and nowadays they can pack every second with gaudy special effects one of the goals of a really good horror flick is to suspend the sense of disbelief of the audience for instance i saw both of the recent mummy movies and nearly got dizzy viewing ridiculous special effects every second it probably costs a million dollars per second to make those movies and my sense of disbelief was never suspended it grew roots subtlety can be more terrifying less is more i first saw the woman in black on the a e channel after flipping through the usual channels of very bad television i stopped to watch it this movie almost has the feel of a masterpiece theater production that was fine with me i ve always preferred british tv movies anyway most viewers would find this to be too slowly paced but the slow pacing helps give the story credibility the special effects are few which lulls the viewer into thinking that this film is set in the real world thus making us a bit more uneasy the makeup and costume for the ghost are kept simple and believable hollywood would have made her look like a she demon from hell with glowing eyes fangs claws etc hollywood would have done an overkill and turned this idea into a mediocrity the woman only makes about five appearances in the film most of them are where she appears in the distance and even that creates a good fright if she appeared too often it could ve cheapened the mood that gets set however this movie is so well made that through much of the film we re led into sensing that she is there the whole time but not visible the scene where she visits arthur kidd late at night and we see her just a little too close is a masterpiece in horror this is just an extraordinary film that i think should rate as one the finest horror films ever made i have a copy of the haunting the changling and a zillion more i haven t seen anything that tops the woman in black yet although i m still looking this movie is so well made that it gives even the most hardened skeptic like me a moment where i almost had second thoughts about the non existence of ghosts i joke to people that i occasionally get brief fears that she could appear standing in the middle of the road or that i d see her staring through my window etc maybe she could be in a crowd at the mall glaring at me with her look of hate this is how a really great horror film should be like a lafanu novel the woman in black very slowly pulls you in and wraps herself around your neck and before you realize it she s squeezing the life out of you and then it s too late closest thing i have to a criticism is that this was made for the small screen and it s a terrible shame that this is out of print i just paid over for my second copy of this movie it s a major prize in my collection now i m on a quest to find an even better horror movie that not only gives the chills but also qualifies a sound drama
sometimes i watch a movie and am really impressed by it and still it is not easy to explain why i liked it that much this is mostly true for the uncommon movies the ones one can hardly compare with the rest out there goodnight mister tom is one of these special movies there is a lot of emotion in that movie and the acting was so good that while watching the movie i was crying and laughing as the story went on the young nick robinson is a young boy william evacuated from london because of the air strikes there during the second world war mr tom played by john thaw is an old man leaving in the village the evacuated children were send to at first tom refuses to take any responsibilities such as taking care for a troubled young lad but accepts since he is left without a choice during the stay mr tom discovers how horrible the life has been for the william alongside his luggage his mom sent a belt and written instructions to the host of her son not to hesitate to use it this belt is berried in the field never to be used in such a brutal manner mr tom provides a real home for william and the boy is happy with his new life he goes to school makes new friends and discovers hidden talents all of the sudden a letter william is called home in london with a letter mentioning that she is not feeling well and it starts all over again only this time it gets much worse there are many feelings you can sense in this movie love fear sadness happiness pain hope and much more goodnight mr tom is another masterpiece of the british cinema comparable only with others such as dear frankie and billy elliot if one is to compare i have truly enjoyed watching it and highly recommend it before finishing this review i would also like to mention the great performance of thomas orange in the role of zac reminded me of a friend of mine from my own childhood
there is no denying that ealing comedies are good but for me this film stands out as one of the best the basic premise of the film is that a small part of pimlico in london is discovered to be part of burgundy not the uk we then follow the lives of the residents in their battle to keep the treasure found after the bomb explodes and keep out the black market traders who soon realise that being exempt from uk law rationing does not exist when they become prisoners in their own street because the government has decided to close the boarder we see them fight back against the system they are forced to ration water and food in their stand for what is right in fact becoming worse off than they were before it all started that s where the moral comes in it s when they loose all the food that they think they are beaten and call for a surrender only to have the whole of london respond to their plight by sending food lot s of it thus enabling them to continue their struggle this film hit s the right note throughout the acting is superb with stanley holloway margaret rutherford hermione baddeley and betty warren standing out it s pitched just right not too sentimental and the moral of the story not forced down your throat well worth a viewing
although dig was being hailed as being closest to what the music industry is like it is highly fabricated the director has misled the audience into believing the brian jonestown massacre disappeared off the face of the earth post and the rivalry between the dandy warhols and jonestown has been milked the truth of the matter is not really exposed in this film that said this film is endlessly quotable and is an interesting watch as we get a look at two groups of very talented musicians creating their art one of the best things this film has going for it is a unique perspective between the indie music scene and the larger corporate scene recommended mostly for the music and the two fantastic bands
this is probably my favorite movie of all time it is perfection in its storytelling it will break your heart not because it s over sentimental but because you will truly feel every emotion these characters go through you feel for doggie because of the hopeless situation that existed for young girls in china at that time
would that more romantic comedies were as deftly executed as this one i never thought anything as mundane as the simple sale of a music box could leave me catching my breath with excitement margaret sullavan makes a marvellous saleswoman and she and james stewart always brought out the best in each other this movie sports what i think is frank morgan s most winning performance and with the wizard of oz and tortilla flat under his belt that is saying a lot the way he finds a christmas dinner partner left me giddy with joy director ernst lubitsch might have thought trouble in paradise his favorite but this one he must surely consider a triumph with some of the wittiest dialogue american movies of the s has to offer
minor spoilerunderrated little stephen king shocker it s not perfect by any stretch of the imagination even if the limp performances of dale midkiff and denise crosby were better there d still be the mismanaged mystical story elements to contend with the old micmac burial ground rachel s terminally ill sister and the jacob marley an victor pascow never really come together into anything coherent and the film in places feels confused and overstuffed but few horror movies really are perfect and what this one may lack in other areas it makes up for in its willingness to shock pet sematary may actually be one of the cruelest horror films in recent memory with its murderous zombie baby and its insanely insensitive portrayal of zelda it s politically incorrect it s tasteless it s gratuitous and yet it makes us squirm with revulsion in a way safer horror movies never can add to that one of fred gwynne s best performances and mary lambert s witty direction and you have an intensely satisfying scary movie even with the hokey ending highly recommended for genre fans out of
this short is a puzzlement words fail me here as this is almost indescribable technically exceptional after more than years the visuals are remarkable and even occasionally amazing this is not something you watch if you like things that are mundane or normal because it most certainly is not either this be an odd one gang well worth checking out but if things like ren and stimpy make your head hurt you may want to skip this recommended
i m not sure under what circumstances director visconti decided to film james cain s novel the postman always rings twice i m not even sure if viscounti acquired the book s rights but the resulting movie is definitely interesting it is not the best version of cain s story i like the version best but thanks to visconti s excellent direction and the casting of clara calamai and massimo girotti a very sensual couple it is a must for noir fans visconti mixes neorealism with noir sensibilities to great effect the film is not perfect though my main complaint is that the film is a little too long for its own good the story moves at a very slow pace i don t think visconti was very good at editing his films i think film noir works better with a short running time fortunately calamai and girotti are magnetic actors that keep the viewer interested anyhow as much as i like this film and the remakes i think no one has made the definitive version of cain s much praised book

damn i ve seen this movie for at least times now and i still don t get bored watching it the visuals are so good and together with the music which is totally awesome and perfect fitting this movie is mind blowing to me the cgis are quite bad imho but the whole visuals with the black and white feeling about it and the totally sterile interiors were just just a genius perfect combination for such a movie the whole feeling about the feeling is indescribable the plot is so good however although the movie had little flaws like e g sometimes i thought the movie was a bit too slow but i don t mean the scenic parts by that i totally loved those also i got distracted very often by the totally complex story like when he is in the underground bunker like thing of digicorps where all their data is saved and has this conversation with the guy down there but that may also just be me d and the end could have been displayed somehow more emphasized they should have made the getting back true memory part a bit longer and louder but then again without all these flaws the movie would have been so good i would have never stopped watching it again and again
i was overtaken by the emotion unforgettable rendering of a wartime story which is unknown to most people the performances were faultless and outstanding

i first saw this movie as a pre teen about the age when kids start to think through their identity i was greatly affected by the scene of the man and the children who he raises as his own the eldest boy has been taunted that his mother is a prostitute and none of his siblings have the same biological father which kurosawa makes obvious by having children who look nothing like each other the man still persuades tho boy that he is their father by the only definition that counts the man is acclaimed to be father by all of the children but one who still prefers her brother each of the vignettes are likewise compelling for their own stories and conclusions it s a great film even if it is not the greatest kurosawa film
wow praise imdb and google for i have been trying to remember the name of this f ing awesome movie for over years now slaughter high man hells yeah i m not going to bore you with a plot summary and actors and yadda yadda yadda cause you all know what s up that s why you re here anyway what i will do however is explain the fond memory i have of this quintessential s d movie slasher joint in when i was around the age of my father used to rent all these horror movies would he care that his kids were watching them with him no so at that young age i saw slaughter high what i saw in that movie stuck with me big time i haven t seen it since but i remember to this day most of the ridiculous kills in the movie for example the post sex scene why is there a metal bed in a school gets electrocuted or the guy being drowned in a cess pool come on my personal favorite though the exploding stomach from the tainted beer amazing how can you honestly hate on a movie where one of the characters finds a beer in an abandoned school like or years later and thinks it would be a good idea to drink it then his stomach explodes what and that great line let s take my car it always starts classic crap all the way i mean i look back now almost years later and laugh at it but when i was i was scared sh tless that jester hat or was it a mask that the killer rocks throughout freaked me the f ck out all in all yes a crappy movie but for nostalgia purposes and for humor factor this movie gets a out of from me either stay up every night real late and hope to catch this on same late late late movie show or hunt down a vhs copy and dust off your vcr

playing kaddiddlehopper col san fernando etc the man was pretty wide ranging and a scream i love watching him interact w amanda blake or don knotts or whomever he clearly was having a ball and i think he made it easier on his guests as well so long as they knew ahead of time it wasn t a disciplined take kind of production relax and be loose was clearly the name of the game there he reminds me of guys like milton berle benny hill maybe jerry lewis some too great timing ancient gags that kept audiences in stitches for decades sheer enjoyment about what he was doing his sad little clown he played was good too but in a touching manner personally i think he s great having just bought a two dvd set of his shows from or so it brings his stuff back in a fond way for me i can remember seeing him on tv at the end of his run when he was winding up the series in or so check this out if you are a fan or curious he was a riot
old jane s mannered tale seems very popular these days i have lost count of the number of versions going around probably the reason is that her ruts are our ruts even at this late date this tv mini series gives it a mannered telling suitable to the novel headstrong opinionated emma is a pretty modern girl when you think about it even though the ambience of jane austen s world may seem a tad artificial to us today if you haven t seem emma i ll only say that self sufficient emma does get her comeuppance it s worth watching to find out how the acting honours here go to the ladies kate prunella lucy and samantha they could almost have had a psychic connection to old jane
midnight cowboy was never a great movie to start with but it is a classic you know it s a classic the moment its insistent theme song everybody s talking starts up on the soundtrack actually not written for the film and the way the camera introduces us to joe buck naked and in the shower we had seen jon voight before but had never really noticed him but when he tells us he s one helluva stud who s to doubt him this was a great performance that had iconic star status as well as a complete grasp of the character and if voight had never done anything else his performance here would still be legendary as it is voight has seldom disappointed on screen even a piece of ham as well cured as his performance in that glorious rubbish anaconda is a source of pleasure the film became famous and infamous almost overnight it was a crowd pleaser even with its downbeat ending funny and sexy and recognizably real it was the tail end of the sixties and all the characters rang true it was also the first x rated film to win the oscar as the year s best picture adapted brilliantly by waldo salt from a james leo herlihy novel it was probably the first main stream commercial american movie to deal with taboo subjects such as homosexuality and drug taking in a matter of fact manner everyone is recognizably human warts and all and everyone is treated sympathetically voight s joe buck is an innocent abroad a candide who comes to new york to seek his fortune as a hustler a profession he sees as glamorous and not seedy he s a cross between a gigolo and a social worker but when he himself is hustled by a scraggy wormy little con man called ratso rizzo dustin hoffman fresh from the graduate and he s a revelation he realizes that perhaps the reality is a little different from the pipe dream essentially it s a male love story though totally platonic between these two not so unlikely bedfellows both totally alone both totally needy each becomes the protector of the other voight with his physical prowess hoffman with his street wise savvy they are misfits adrift from the mainstream tolerant of their own peculiarities and the deviances of others though straight voight isn t beyond a homosexual encounter in a nd street cinema with a boy even lonelier than himself the whole film posits a strangely christian attitude it s also magnificently acted while voight and hoffman hold the screen throughout there are superb vignettes from the likes of brenda vaccaro and sylvia miles as well as john mcgiver bob balaban and bernard hughes as sundry customers and hangers on beautifully delineated little character studies that seem to transcend acting altogether while john schlesinger s direction gives the film the feel of a documentary as well as an alien s totally detached eye view of the american under belly without rancor and without criticism on second thoughts maybe it is a great movie after all
this film was really eye opening i have seen this film several times first when i was four and i actually remembered it and then when i was the whole message that the director is conveying is for everyone to wake up and not make the mistake of leaving god out of our everyday lives or just plain going the extra mile to insult him a great movie for non believers and believers alike
bette midler is again divine raunchily humorous in love with burlesque capable of bringing you down to tears either with old jokes with new dresses or merely with old songs with more power punch than ever all in all singing new ballads power singing the good old perennial ones such as the rose stay with me and yes even wind beneath my wings the best way to appreciate the divine miss m has always been libe since this is the next best thing to it i strongly recommended to all with a mixture of adult wide eyed enchantment and appreciation and a child s mischievous wish for pushing all boundaries
in christian duguay s movie hitler the rise of evil hitler s early years in life and politics is shown in a successful way with some minor historical errors and some exaggeration it is quite natural for a hollywood movie to contain such things as the main purpose of production is the income that they will get from the movie even though such errors may disappoint some members of the audience who believes that everything should be done by the book i believe that most of them fits well with the rest of the movie making it more interesting we should not forget that this movie is not a documentary who cares how did his dog died anyway throughout the movie hitler is portrayed as a psychologically unstable figure that gets angry very easily and is very passionate about his ideals but he was not portrayed as a super villain but more like an ambitious politician i believe that this is a nice perspective as the movie is not contaminated by tons of negative emotions and this made the movie somewhat objective yes he was a little mad and his methods were rough but he was still a human not a totally insane figure as portrayed in inglorious bastards i believe it made the movie more realistic even with some inaccuracies in the historical facts the flow of history is nicely reflected to spectators even though the movie s focus was around hitler we also had chance to see what is happening in the country as a result of these actions via newspapers discussions of people and the songs in a jewish cabaret also society s reaction was also reflected to movie but it was very limited struggles of journalist fritz gerlich and ironic plays that are played in the cabaret was amusing and interesting but that was all mostly we only saw his followers rampaging the streets and cheering him another thing that was missing in the movie is information about the origins of his hatred for jews in the beginning of the movie some ideas about this is given but they were quite superficial all of a sudden he was a politician who is giving speeches about necessity of extermination of jews in conclusion hitler the rise of evil cannot be considered as an excellent movie that everyone will like but it is not unsatisfactory at all if you can stand directors that change history for cash it is an interesting movie reflecting hitler s personality in a successful way
this show was fabulous it was intricate and well written and all the characters where likable with out being horribly sweet even jonathan cake the philandering boyfriend was likable since our airwaves are filled with crap like american idol and dancing with the stars it was nice to see a drama that was not too soap opera like it was always intriguing to see how each character would be connected to the next circumstance it really is annoying that we finally get a show that makes you think a little bit and have it thrown out because of some mysterious number that most of us don t even pay attention to some of us are not sheep this show will be missed maybe not by a lot of people but by some pretty loyal fans
i have no idea why this flick is getting such a bad rap by so many imdb users some are saying it s his worst movie ever what haven t any of you seen cradle the grave my favorite criticism is that the plot is totally stupid and just an excuse to hang all of the action sequences on duh what the crap were you expecting from a jet li movie did you honestly believe that someone thought up the story then just loaded it up with action of course not black mask is awesome wall to wall action throughout nearly it s entire running time it s also deliciously gruesome and we get plenty of severed limbs decapitations and creative ways of watching the bad guys and quite a few innocent people too get slaughtered most of li s other martial arts films are nursery school when compared to black mask there is no holding back on the gratuitous violence bloodshed or action sequences whatsoever and that made me a happy camper again if you go into a jet li movie expecting magnificent dialog and an intriguing plot you are going for the wrong reasons black mask is probably my favorite of his movies though beware of the horrendous dubbing
the main reason to see this film is warren william who is in top form as the shyster campaign manager he is electric constantly finding ways to fool the public and defeat the opposing party in the midst of the biggest disasters william is a great actor i feel he never got his due bette davis as his girlfriend also shines in an under written role personally i found guy kibbee not quite right as the lame brained candidate that william and the others are trying to foist on the public he seemed more like an empty canvas than a person i would have preferred to see a real character emerge rather than a non character the story itself is implausible silly and clich d but warren william and bette davis are well worth watching
the final chapter in the hanzo the razor trilogy provides fitting closure for this entertaining series of samuraisploitation inoue replaces yasuzu masumura blind beast red angel manji in the director s chair but the style is pretty much the same perhaps due to shintaro katsu serving as the producer apart from the titular antihero hanzo uncovers a female ghost who is guarding treasure hidden in the bottom of the lake of course hanzo being hanzo he s not put off by the fact she s a ghost so he proceeds to rape ahem interrogate her using the now familiar revolving net device the plot takes through a series of blind monks who also doubletime as loansharks corrupt officials promiscuous wives and the necessary hack and slash hanzo s superior officer onishi and his two servants provide the typical comedic notes and generally it s business as usual significantly less convoluted and easier to follow than the first which is all over the place and a bit of a mess less stylish dramatic and bloody than the second arguably the finest in the hanzo series but still entertaining and worthwhile on its own merits complete with trademark training sequences the obligatory rape swordfights and a mystery hanzo is called upon to investigate this will ultimately satisfy the fans
many reviews i ve read reveals that most people tend to like part one better than part two i feel exactly the opposite part one played around a bit much with trying to find different ways of showing che guevara s personality through different types of film stock different locations and cutting back and forth between an interview and the cuban revolution for the most part it was structured finely but somewhat distracting in part two che enters bolivia and along with changing geographical location the rules and the structure changes gone are the spacial jumps and switching between stocks the documentary realism and the treatises instead now we are literally trapped with che in a desaturated depopulated landscape where the only people who exist are burdened too far with their lives for anything but survival to be an option i posit that it s the dark turn of che s life that is the real reason why most people prefer part one to part two the change in geographic location also signifies for me at least that che part one and che part two are in fact the second two acts of a three act structure begun by motorcycle diaries motorcycle diaries is che s coming of age or more appropriately coming of ideals in argentina che part one is his military leadership in cuba and che part two is his downfall in bolivia these movies do not completely illustrate his life we re missing his experiences in guatamala and more importantly in my opinion his post cuban revolution executions but they create a very detailed exploration into the controversial aspects of his character and nature as worldwide symbol he both symbolizes the idealism and need for armed resistance to oppression and revolutionary failings in the post world war ii third world countries and their hindering by such activities as um the cias meddling but yet again all of that is projected on screen in this case not through long scenes of dialog and speeches but through a much more intimate suffering portrayal of che at the end of his thread and his life again the rules have changed and in this case it s hard to tell if there was any chance of success at all the number of times the camera shows people literally trapped between a rock and a hard place and the desaturated shaky long takes involves the audience into the narrative of people imprisoned in a hostile landscape an existential hell where revolutionary beliefs ultimately end up taking second tier to the desperation of hunted people starving to death it s just not that easy of a movie to watch but it s very effective polarisdib
zero day is based of columbine high school massacre and its a video diary of two boys at first you don t know whats going to happen you think it is just a bad student film until they start talking about the horrible things they are going to do in this quite school until they start talking about pipe bombs and guns and going shooting in the woods they is a lot to say about this movie all know this film is well a film you forget you watching a film and watching a real video two boys made the two boys act like they are in a weird cult they burn all there stuff like play station games books dvds homework stuff school stuff these two boys can be anybody your friends you brothers or the people you see walking down the street it goes through there daily actives and that is making a gun in the videos they make it mentions the bullying that happens to them and how people said stuff about there clothes and the things you are into i m not saying its right but many people do do things like that and also the thing is with this people are suspected to like it because of the sensitive topic they have chosen on this film so thats my review on zero day and lets just say the end shooting scene is messed up
la teta i la luna the breast and the moon describes the life of a year old boy named tete who is obsessed with breasts growing up in catalunya i love this movie because the characters are very honest and very human like all the characters in bigas luna s movies also director of jamon jamon tete reminded me of how intriguing and exciting life can be at that age also being from catalunya north east of spain it brought lots of memories to my mind this movie shows how beautiful catalunya is nice people nice life and specially lots of non uptight people
hard to imagine this film is based on a true story and how christy managed to accomplish the miracle is so heart stirring daniel day lewis is a chameleon really hard to imagine how much effort he had done to create this disabled character watching him on screen is a shocking and breathtaking experience the movie is not so pessimistic as i thought before the story is kinda bright and intriguing christy is not despised by the normals his life is also colorful and delightful although we can be aware of the loneliness and the painful fetter through his eyes one important factor of christy s success is his mother s support which seems to be more touching and the unknown actress brenda fricker also deserves her oscar award for this role this fat little middle aged woman uses her all to make christy s dream come true so lucky for christy and hugh o conor is also excellent as young christy what a performance for a child the love story of christy is very well done trustful christy wants love and nothing can derive him of the right to love his crush on the beautiful dr eileen cole surprisingly played by fiona shaw i am deeply impressed with her role in harry potter series the loathsome aunt petunia so her appearance in this role is really beyond my mind but anyway any woman has her own youth is paranoiac and offensive i do have sympathy for him love is a two edged sword happiness and agony are just next to each other btw jim sheridan s works are all good in america the boxer etc except get rich or die trying god knows why he chose to direct that crap really a career taint for him what a pity
whether it s a good movie or not films of this kind has to be made i think it remembers me of i love huckabees a overwhelmingly puzzling movie with isabelle huppert being sodomized by a young american in a mud pond in a merry sadistic masochist way i hope the director will go on stepping across the border as though i felt the choices vincenzo natali made were not always subtle some of the scenes were unhappily kind of tarte la cr me like a childish slapstick speaking about script and cinematography the color of cube was black nothing is white more cheerful surprisingly than the former films of natali
i rented this some years ago the video store had only vhs at the time straight to video was hitting it s strides you know where the box covers use the same font and color schemes of successful films i didn t know what to expect other than what was printed first thing i thought while watching was what the hells wrong with the sound obviously there was no dialogue dubbing words echoed so i stopped munching on whatever i had to pay closer attention mind you there s no shakespeare here just simple talk the story is simple enough boy meets girl etc what struck me as humorous and heartfelt was the people in the movie didn t seem like caricatures written into the story but rather non actors plucked temporarily from their real jobs uniforms included all the while you begin to sense what the filmmaker is after then see that there are no attempts at cheap humor people hurting their privates using vulgarities this couldn t have hurt the marketing there was something honest about it i thought if they d have a bigger budget then it would have been better which i m sure they considered daily but they went ahead and made it this i felt was what independent film making is all about the word indy is thrown around as if it s a genre ha that s funny
this movie scared the crap out of me i have to admit that i spent most of the film watching through my fingers but what i saw was really scary i screamed out loud two or three times during the show film making wise my favorite aspects were the sound and photography the sound was particularly great and the setting was really creepy beautiful i read somewhere that it s some weird husband and wife team that made it for some reason that makes this even stranger for me if you enjoy the jumps and jitters of scary movies than this one is for you very suspenseful and a great movie to rent with a bunch of friends who love to watch movies curled up on a sofa screaming like little girls

yes this is one of the great musical movies i grew up with with such great entertainers as frank sinatra and gene kelly not to mention the petite and glorious voice of kathryn grayson the music and dancing is superb i understand frank took lessons from kelly and there is kelly dancing with jerry mouse which is quite unique for the time betty garrett plays the waitress who falls in love with sinatra she is one of hollywood s great underrated stars i saw this again on a e tv and as well have it in my old vcr tapes never get tired of these old musicals whatever happened to hollywood
and my children love it now granted i can watch it now and realize the animation wasn t that great and that the plot is trite hey if every villian introduced themselves by saying i ammmmm daaaarrrkk heeeeaaarrt i think they might be laughed at but for young children it is a moral story with catchy music music so catchy mind you that i still had the words memorized after not seeing this film in twenty years i would definitely suggest this one for younger children
i d love to give this movie a but in its existing state i can only go to tops the post code editing read destroying of this film warrants a point demerit from my very limited knowledge of film history baby face was apparently one of two movies that finally broke the camel s back and brought the full wrath and enforcement of the production code into play in i don t know what the other movie was as a result the movie in its original incarnation was never allowed to be re released after it was chopped and edited to bits and no original version is known to exist today the best that we can see today is the version that tcm turner classic movies shows but that is blatantly edited in several scenes and has a really disappointing happy ending slapped onto the end all the above being said the movie is still pretty darned great and lots of fun to watch barbara stanwyck is as always absolutely amazing and wonderful she is so beautiful and powerful she just owns the whole movie she plays a woman who s been used by men her entire life starting with her father who pimps her out to the local erie pa steel workers as well as to local politicians in a quid pro quo of if you don t shut down my speakeasy i ll let you sleep with my daughter when the father dies in a fiery explosion near the beginning of the flick the smile on stanwyck s face is priceless after the fire stanwyck leaves erie with her maid and heads to new york city she sets her sights on a skyscraper and starts literally working her way to the top starting out with the personnel clerk in the hr department she sleeps with him to get an entry level position at the bank from there she sleeps with man after man after man including a very young john wayne using each new man to help her land a higher paying job on a higher floor of the skyscraper with increasingly powerful male bosses cum sugar daddies stanwyck stops at nothing in her rise to the top it is great fun to see her and her maid in increasingly fancier clothes and apartments as stanwyck works her way up the corporate ladder stanwyck is the ultimate femme fatale manipulating she vixen in this flick if you watch this movie i recommend stopping when you see the george brent character courtland trenholm die in stanwyck s arms skip the remaining minutes or so the happy ending slapped on to the end of the movie for post code audiences is insulting to the audience s intelligence and lame beyond belief the bank board members are sitting around a table expositing about mr and mrs trenholm s million dollar donation to the bank and how they are living happily but poor in erie with former vp trenholm now working in the steel mills cut to the exact same footage of a steel plant that we saw in the beginning of the movie the end puh leeze how lame the movie originally ended with george brent succeeding in his suicide attempt i think that ending fits the overall mood of the movie much better than the slapped on post code ending i certainly hope that a print of the original pre code version of this flick is discovered during my lifetime update the original has been found and should be out on dvd and or tcm in until then i ll enjoy the tcm version and switch it off before the lame o post code ending
before she went into politics or public service glenda jackson was one of britain s finest film actresses this film displays her talent despite having a supporting role in a stellar cast that includes julie christie as kitty the wife of a british royal captain who has lost his memory of the last years and jenny played by american ann margret in an almost unrecognizable role as the doting sister alan bates plays the captain who suffers from memory loss triggered by the shell shock during world war i sir ian holm has a smaller role as the doctor treating him you see familiar faces like sheila keith patsy byrne and frank finlay you can t help but watch glenda play a dowdy housewife and the first true love of the captain but they came from different classes it s not the greatest movie but it s good to see glenda s amazing talent she is still a fantastic actress comedy or drama she makes margaret grey into a likable character and you see why a regal captain fell in love with her
words can hardly describe it so i ll be brief the thief of bagdad was my favorite movie as a child and it has never ceased to astound or enchant me i loved this film from the first moment i saw it when i was a boy of six who had started reading the arabian nights i remember walking into the tv room in the middle of sabu s battle with the giant spider and being instantly beguiled rarely has so much beauty magic and wonder been captured on film sabu and john justin are superb as the dashing heros conrad veidt is throughly delightful as the wicked villain jaffar and rex ingram is a joy to watch as the sardonic genie georges perinal s photography is some of the best use of technicolor one of the three credited directors is michael powell a filmmaker who has been rightfully heralded by the critics but is often overlooked by audiences for his remarkable films including a matter of life and death aka stairway to heaven and the red shoes he is one of the true masters of the camera right up there with david lean akira kurosawa and orson welles as with all great works of art the beauty of the thief of bagdad lies in the detail every frame has its own magical charm the story never lags and the characters and their actions are always involving here is a film that will never grow old
prussic gas a murderer donning a red clansman suit and hood wielding a white whip and the murders of college school girls at the hands of paid convicts enlisted by a mysterious mastermind who keeps his face hidden within an office containing aquariums of turtles and fish the inspectors at scotland yard higgins ijoachim fuchsberger and his superior sir john siegfried sch renberg certainly have their hands full with this case it all seems to center around student ann portland uschi glas who when she turns is to inherit a great deal of wealth the girls who are targeted share a room with ann but the reason for their murders remains a mystery sy s finest must figure out the staff of the girls dormitory all seem to be hiding something and certain members of the faculty are falling prey to the killer in the red monk robe disguise talented enough to precisely strangle the necks of those attacked with the whip two prisoners are commissioned by a mystery man to use the newly created toxic gas created by a scientist murdered at the beginning of the film during what was supposed to be a monetary exchange for his creation it s a clever scheme where a driver greaves g nter meisner meets the convicts who hide in a barrel who are assisted by a corrupt prison guard taken blindfolded to the secret room of the mastermind he gives them orders on who to kill and how uncovering this operation is a top priority for higgins and sir john for it will lead them to the truth they seek in regards to the murders and why they are happening under suspicion are girls dormitory headmistress her author brother a sweaty incredibly nervous chemistry teacher a snooping gardener and the bannister some are red herrings until they are disposed of throwing the viewer for a loop each time until the real mastermind is discovered the ending features multiple twists out of the krimi films i ve seen the college girl murders is the closest to a giallo with it s colorful killer a convoluted plot yielding lots of surprises and potential suspects sordid shenanigans between adults and the college girls at the dormitory i think you can also see the influence of james bond on this particular krimi film with the villain mastermind s secret hideout with an alligator pit which isn t used the fake bible water pistol when opened fires the gas into the face of startled victims the greaves royles royce which has latches that cause flaps to darken the windows without revealing the passenger in the back seat and the peep holes used to spy on the girls in their rooms and while swimming many might consider sir john a liability due to his bumbling buffoonish behavior and how he often undermines higgins abilities to get at the truth perhaps poking fun at know it all british inspectors who harm a case more than solve it i felt he was used as comedy relief particularly with his attempts at psychoanalyzing suspects and potential victims often misunderstanding what are told to him higgins using the skills adopted over his years as an investigator instead follows the clues facts often avoiding sir john as much as possible capable direction by the reliable alfred vohrer who keeps the pace humming at a nice speed and the screenplay is full of interesting characters and lurid content the fact that so many of the adults surrounding the dormitory are suspect any of them might be the one wielding the whip or calling the shots behind those murdered girls executions i d say this may be one of the best if not the best examples of the krimi genre for it keeps you guessing always one more ace up it s sleeve the revelations unearthed at the very end are quite eye opening and you even get a literal unmasking of the real mastermind pulling the strings to top it all off
a must see film with great dialogues great music great acting and a superb atmosphere in the film you will follow people for one day in the city of antwerp they are all individuals and sometimes plain weird that s how i love them i m not going to say anything else just go see and enjoy it
while it certainly wasn t the best movie i ve ever seen it was certainly worth the which can t be said for many movies these days this was a pleasant account of a true story although many of the details of the real story were twisted for the movie ie billy sunday s character was three or four people in the real story combined together robert deniro was of course good and cuba gooding jr was also impressive
i m not at all picky about horror movies and i m willing to watch pretty much any of them that doesn t mean that i m willing to re watch many of them or that i won t have criticism for them this movie is creepy and is very well done in fact i think this movie would make an excellent double bill with session i should specify before i get to my comments that i watched this alone i started watching it before going to bed and got about minutes in before i realized that it was too effective so i saved the rest of it for the morning even while watching it in broad daylight it was still creepy however i can t vouch for how effective it would be when watching in a larger group after the death of their daughter a couple move to a remote cabin as a means of trying to come to terms with this death let me make note of this death this is one of the rare movies that doesn t shy away from the death of a child this is much more important as it both sets the tone as well as explains much of the acting that permeates the movie the couple is not doing well the wife has distanced herself from the relationship and the husband is doing what he can to try to bring her back while some of the comments have complained about their acting one specified that they act more like a father and daughter than husband and wife and that s legitimate he s trying to give her more direction it s a role that men sometimes take on there are a variety of scares in the film and most are fairly non violent though grotesque in some ways the story itself feels very straightforward for most of the film and takes an odd turn near the end while the turn is not absurd it is certainly not what you expected from the way things had been progressing moody atmospheric and very well done for something that appears to have been shot on video

i caught this movie on my local movie channel and i rather enjoyed watching the film it has all the elements of a good teen film and more this film aside from dealing with boys girls relationships and sex and the like also deals with the issue of steroid use by young people the film has that real life feel to it no loud music no special effects and no outrageous scenes which for this movie was right that feel makes it easy to relate to the characters in the film some of which we probably know from where we live overall a good movie fun to watch
most folks might say that if one were to spend a saturday night watching a movie you must be really bored actually i had just gotten back home from being out and turned on the tv and there it was paulie i had missed the opening credits so i didn t know the name of it but i saw that it had cheech marin in it so i naturally thought i had tuned into born in east l a when i saw him talking to a talking parrot i was ready to dismiss this as the kind of flop movie they show late in the night happy to say it was better than that as you know if you don t already paulie is lost and trying to get back to his original owner seems it s taken years to find her what should be paulie s advantage is actually a dis advantage in ways people come across a literate parrot and all they see is a way to make money or benefit themselves while cheech marin s character is making money from him he s not mean to him the dance sequences with the parrots are something kids will find cute i found them amusing paulie who s naive learns quickly that not all humans are nice people especially the owner of an animal research lab the man lies to him saying he ll help him find his owner as long as he helps in his animal communications research paulie is now stuck but decides to make a fool out of the man at a demonstration to others of paulie s vocal ability throughout the film paulie s telling his story to the facilities janitor who ends up freeing him several other animals and finding the location of paulie s owner it s a touching reunion out of the wing clipping scene should have been assumed and not shown that part might bother younger children otherwise it s a great movie for older kids and adults who are a kid at heart end
ya know when one looks at this brian depalma film today i m sure there has been allot of criticism about how dated it is also about the violence when i looked at this film on vhs when i was i thought it was ulta violent and gritty as well but i didn t get it a few decades go by and man how i know how much i didn t get in this film this is a remake of an excellent film which was done back in the s s how can you improve upon a classic ya don t but you tell a tale that is brought up to date through the eyes of the new immigrants during the most greed ridden decade the over indulgent s depalma stone and the gang present an ambitious disturbing and darn right good film yes disco was dying and new wave punk were taking over but these immigrants from cuba who had to make a new home in florida couldn t tell the difference it was exciting it was what they wanted but how to get it to these immigrants there was only one way to get it in florida where they were by having lots of money and to get the money you had to take over running a drug empire al pacino was fantastic to me as tony montana the little train that could what an amazing way to have your lead character look at america to fight kill steal lie cheat all to get the money the women and the power that s what tony saw as the american dream he wanted it he wanted to live it and in his circle saw nothing wrong with how he went to get it tony montana s command of the english language was heavily saturated with the f word but what did you expect emily post s finishing school for him and his co horts look at how they came to america what they knew what they were exposed to this is the way tony and his crew chose to be all they can be in america it was all about the power tony montana would and did anything to achieve it it all its violent lying stealing crooked thieving glory the part of the film that personified the s to me is the money laundering tony s crew bringing sacks of drug money to the bank did those around tony and his crew care at the clubs where he spent and drank nope money was money and with money you get the power tony was living high off the hog he and his pretty blond american trophy he married played well by michelle pfieffer after tony montana s rise to power he finds out its really crappy up there he s riddled with doubt he s drug addicted he s paranoid he s surrounded by those who want to take him on in a bloody take over his trophy s american blonde drug addicted wife he finds out is a bore he needs to keep atop of his empire because he s going down and down he goes in a horrific violent fashion but again i ask what do you expect this is the quintessential s film telling you a warped tale of how some misunderstand the american dream to obsession it s violent bloody overly so but it drives the point disturbingly home not all cubans thrown out of cuba who landed in florida in the s were anything like tony montana give me a break but the showing of how miserable the s were with its emphasis on greed and money as the only measures in the usa to be somebody and have power took its tool on these poor characters and their lives in america makes you wonder has anything from then been learned today
bette midler is indescribable in this concert she gives her all every time she is on stage whether we are laughing at her jokes and antics or dabbing our eyes at the strains of one of her tremendous ballads bette midler moves her audience if you can t see it live which is the best way to see bette then this is the next best thing an interesting thing to look at is how incredible her voice has changed and matured over the years but never lost its power her more vocally correct version of stay with me never loses anything in spirit from the rose or divine madness here it is just more pure and as heartfelt as ever i will treasure this concert for a very long time
sometimes realism can work against the effectiveness of a film that s no problem here the sets are cheesy inside and out the fog is ubiquitous half disguising the shabbiness of the production if there s a bar the name painted on the front window says simply wine and spirits the result is a claustrophobic set of scenes not a single shot of a city or even a fake skyline that s the kind of dublin this story is about just as jack the ripper movies are about seedy foggy cobblestoned whitechapel who would want it any other way how could it have been any other way with no bankable stars a minuscule budget and a four week shooting schedule the acting follows suit outrageously hammy on everyone s part sometimes my god it s positively excruciating mrs mcphillips moaning after frankie is shot dead outside the house victor mclaglin however delivers exactly the right kind of overdone performance wardrobe has stuffed him into a too small jacket so that he seems to be bursting out of it like frankenstein s monster his every movement seems to go a little farther than it was intended to when he slaps his cap on his head he bops himself on the temple a big blustering blubbering baby he seems constantly drunk he betrays his best friend for the reward money which will take him and his would be girl to america not a good guy in the ordinary sense yet we wince as he begins to spend the pounds more and more of it during a wild alcoholic night because every expensive and grandiose gesture takes him farther from his dream i wouldn t argue it but i can understand why he won an oscar as for max steiner s score wow every movement already overdone is not only underlined by the mickey mouse music but highlighted in glossy yellow it shouldn t have happened the heavenly choirs the endearing young charms the minstrel boy the gurgling tune while mclaglen drinks from the bottle it would have been better off with no score at all well how is it as a whole dated by any measure but not a product of its times that s why i admire it yes the symbolism is clumsy at times mclaglen a real dummy bumping his head against a hanging sign the fog the blind man but what impresses me is how little of this was being tried at the time what strikes us as overly arty today was in something quite different from what was seen in most of the programmers being ground out at the time if it falls short at times it doesn t matter the movie was an act of courage politically and morally as well as poetically the legion of decency condemned it because of a scene in a brothel a director s goal should exceed his grasp or what s a script for watching it now however in the story is more disturbing than ever john ford obviously sympathized with the irish rebels they kill but only out of what they see as necessity he knows too much to live what if he goes to the tans oh it s not me self i m thinking of but all of us of ireland herself the irish are sentimentalized and sympathetic i wonder if the jihadists in the middle east don t use a similar logic to justify their acts of violence
although the movie is clearly dated audiences can still easily identify with the plight of hapless buster in this timeless and very funny underdog tale buster fights against unkindly odds in three different ages the stone age the roman age and the moden age playing almost the same character with just a change of scenery to help us identify the different ages in this movie we see one of the earliest comedic depictions of the caveman stereotype who wins his love not by romance but by brute force as well as a funny twist on roman gladiatorial combat two comedic sketches that long predate such spoofs as mel brooks history of the world part i the underlying theme of the movie is simple yet convincing although the times may have a changed we still face the same struggles even in modern times that we fought in prehistoric times in order to win the girl keep in mind this is the theme of america a time when chauvinism was still en vogue it is interesting to look at this movie over eighty years later and consider how dramatically things have changed from this movie s modern times to now
although the beginning of the movie in new york takes too long the movie is a must see for people who like this genre when hannah goes to berlin to visit the older woman who helped her mother during the war the movie gets much much better the movie is a bit like the pianist can not really be compared
i drove from sacramento to san francisco and back to see this movie premiere and really glad i did as a big movie fan and a life long northern californian i was surprised how many oscar winning films have been made in the bay area as a fashion designer who really wants to stay in the bay area as opposed to going to la george lucas comments about persistence community and having a vision really resonated with me hey if he and all the other filmmakers can make it in sf so can other artists would recommend this film
by god it s been a long time since i saw this probably about years ago the movie tells us kids all about human blood and the circulatory system very professionally put together disney style animation plus human actors it was directed by frank capra for pete s sake kind of an overkill i wonder if the very high production value is worth what amounts to a film strip s worth of information on the human body but boy will those kids watching it learn even now i can clearly remember dr baxter being challenged by hemo himself to name what common material most resembles human blood to which the doctor immediately answers sea water
this is superb the acting wonderful sets clothes music but most of all the story itself i am amazed there aren t more reviews of this movie certainly one of the best of the s it s also a wonderful movie to see in tandem with the great random harvest which has much the same opening crisis a middle aged unknown english w w i officer is in a hospital toward the close of the war suffering from shell shock and complete amnesia without any idea of his name origin or anywhere he belongs he proves to be a very wealthy established man when he recovers he will not remember the years before the war but there the movies resemblances end my warmest thanks to all who participated in the movie particularly the actors ian holm alan bates ann margret what a great and surprising casting choice glenda jackson julie christie this one stays with you forever
lots and lots of information to digest and if you ve seen zizek you know his pace also if you haven t seen most of the films or at least some other films by the same directors mentioned in this doc you will be somewhat lost and the film list is long director includes hitchcock psycho vertigo birds lynch lost highway mullholland falls wild at heart blue velvet tarkovsky stalker solaris and the conversation coppola there are some segway films like star wars espisode iii matrix but these i suspect are baits to be sure zizek is never boring but if you don t buy or if you mind the psycho analytics then you ll be annoyed to no end but you should not be as the setting clips the way the film interleave with these clips zizek s points are never boring
despite of the success in comedy or drama the turkish directors are failure in horror thriller okul d bbe are good examples for the awful horror turkish films but if you watch gen you will understand that it is a strike the atmosphere of the movie is impressive and dark also the special features are colorful and not cheap the soundtracks fit the movie but the script is not totally perfect and the theme of the movie is ordinary as a result gen does not add any difference to horror movies but it does not disappoint thriller fans in this respect it is a success for yesilcam and turkey
the sword fighting was out of this world the fights scenes spectacular without the flying on a wire techniques until the end that are way too common today the scene with chan and pray was probably the highlight of the movie the characters in the assault on the bad guys mansion were clich but the movie is comfortable with it an injection of humour from woo the plot with it s twists and turns was unpredictable and exciting and you couldn t tell who was good or bad or which side people were on a good sense of suspense and well timed surprises the depth of the story is quite intense for a flighty film of this genre and reaches you in ways most kung fu flicks don t
fabulous film rented the dvd recently and was floored by this stunning piece of work douglas sirk was a filmmaking genius and he gets performances out of rock hudson dorothy malone oscar winner robert stack oscar nominated and lauren bacall that words cannot describe paul verhoeven brilliantly payed homage to this film by having dorothy malone play sharon stone s murdering inspirational guru in his basic instinct what a great joke by turns the film is hilarious riveting campy biting trashy compelling and eye rolling it s definately the grandaddy of every tawdry big and little screen soap opera but none have had the dazzling style like you ll see here the camera work is smooth and polished the use of color is breathtaking the opening montage set to the title song is beyond memorable the one dimensional characters are unforgettable and the final image will have you scratching your head as to how the censors back then let it make the final cut while most older highly regarded films can sometimes be a boring chore to sit through written on the wind contains so much and goes by so fast that it s actually a shame when it ends thank you to mr sirk for crafting and todd haynes for drawing attention to what has now become one of my favorite films of all time see this movie
film can be a looking glass to see the world in a new light good night and good luck for instance offered parallels to modern judgement without evidence and encroachments on freedom it is easier to examine a moral problem when it is not too close to home by putting it in a fictional or historic context removed from our immediate situation with pornography we consider ourselves enlightened and our forefathers to be hidebound by quaint ideas usually involving fire and brimstone but the definition of what is obscene can easily fall prey to ignorance and unscientific interpretation instead of evidence bettie page was a cult icon of an era which included not just mccarthyism but the banning of comics such as tales from the crypt on the basis that they would turn youths into half mad juvenile delinquents this film developed from key questions raised in her life poses dilemmas that are as relevant today as back in our film opens with two key scenes in the first we see well dressed respectable looking men in a seedy bookshop one of them asks for pictures of women in kinky boots and being restrained then turns out to be an undercover cop conducting a sting the second scene shows bettie page waiting to be called as a witness looking quite demure as if she had just come out of church the first mins are in black white old fashioned film effects such as wipes and fades add to the sense that we are watching a film from bygone years as do the mannerisms of the cast skilfully recreated s scenes contemporaneous slang phrases and the terse dialogue associated with film making of the period archive footage is frequently intercut which will delight many and irritate others in keeping with its theme the movie is almost a collection of different types of photography in motion and the older clips of fabulous beaches and landmarks juxtapose well against bettie s classic poses hearken back to an age of health nature magazines although i admit that if you are not captivated by the story you may find the effect a bit choppy very soon we go into flashback bettie escapes a depression years downtrodden life in nashville enlivened only with church singing and soul saving and goes alone to make her own way after her initial success her modelling work splits into two strands the mainstream glamour work focussing on her over the rainbow smile and the specialist interest photos involving dressing up in high heeled boots and light bondage gear in an earlier audition reminiscent of a scene with naomi watts character in mulholland drive who was also called betty she gives a performance that is full of emotion contrasting with her normal animated cheerful but ultimately bland day to day expression is part of her still unfulfilled bettie is frequently rejected in auditions once they realise she is the well known pin up girl but we have never been asked to feel sorry for bettie page her abusive childhood is quickly referenced and skipped over when she is raped by four hometown lads we see only the threat and then bettie recovering and surviving picking herself up in deserted woodland and putting on the brave face of someone who refuses to lie down and die although no nudity is involved it s bettie s special interest photos that eventually arouse trouble when we go back to the court the opinions of a clergyman on the corrupting influence of such photos are taken as evidence a psychologist authoritatively says how the photos lead to suicide murder and psychosis in youngsters who are exposed to them presumably not in that order eventually a star witness explains how his son s life came to an end as a result of such photos being trussed up like that it is not made clear how being trussed up causes death the text accompanying a series of bettie s photographs in a magazine tell how she was forced to endure terrible agonies with the fetish restraints the audience knows that she actually found them quite hilarious and that the wordings like the photos themselves were pure dramatisations after a hr wait bettie is told her evidence she is the one person who could state definitively that she was not photographed in agony will not be required the horrors of the photos have been proved if this all sounds like the dark ages which we have left consider a recent incident in which an ann summers advert was banned it said for fashion and passion whip along to your local store with a photograph of a woman s back she s wearing a bra and thong and her hands are handcuffed behind her back the lingerie and sex toys company that targets female consumers and also supports charities fighting domestic violence said its adverts aimed to give women sexual confidence and always showed women in control of their sexuality one might conclude that the prejudice and ignorance of the betty page investigations still holds currency bettie s religious views are integral to the story just as the concept of sin is integral to christianity and contributes to the forbidden nature of sexual enjoyment frequently prevalent in the uk and us as opposed to the more factual approach found in continental europe it could be argued the formulae of sin and redemption and being saved are even reflected in mating patterns that perpetuate traditional male dominance a policeman making a friendly but sexually motivated approach to bettie outside the courtroom offers to save her from loneliness the knight in shining armour might be chivalrous but it also assumes a woman in need of rescue love it or hate it the notorious bettie page is an unusual and extraordinary film and a moral wake up call for those that heed it there is excellent ensemble acting and gretchen mol as bettie is remarkable as the whole film succeeds or falls on her powerful performance
i cannot say this movie is a disappointment because i read some reviews before watching and it did not do as well as i thought it would have the bar was not set that high so the fact that my expectations were met is not saying much the good the city of new york if you live in the city like me you ll recognize certain places and understand that the city is supposed to be more than just a setting rather one of the main characters there are genuinely tender moments humorous conversations and plot twists left and right which all keep things interesting the bad the first thing i thought after leaving the theater was that i wanted more but not in the positive leave them wanting more fashion certainly the good skits scenes outweigh the bad but there are a lot of skits that fall within the in between category too many in fact which is what ultimately brings the movie down also new york city s diversity though hinted at though the many distant pans of the city and mentioned in conversation throughout the movie is never really realized or analyzed to the point of doing the city justice for example many of the skits involve well to do middle aged whites i mean i know the city is home to many of the said demographic but come on paris je taime s plot and character diversity makes new york city look like lancaster pa or someplace really white it is just disappointing to see the city shortchanged on its heritage like that still even after having said this i would recommend giving new york i love you a view who knows maybe you ll disagree with my opinion and maybe you won t you will never know until you see it for yourself this review is not meant to deter anyone from watching this movie as everyone s opinion on art differs i m just giving you a very vague heads up on what to expect
it s hard to rate films like this because do you rate it on production or just fun i saw this film back in about or so when i was a boy and i m sorry to say it started a life long fascination with ninjas the plot is fairly dire and the acting is of course terrible but there is a certain mystique surrounding the ninjas in this film which makes for quite a good atmosphere what is important are the fight scenes while a little sparce are really good i must say it was better when i was a boy only now can i see the glaring points of unbelievable nonsense in the film but as a sit back with a few beers martial arts film i can t fault it it delivers and is much better than the mountains of american ninja style rubbish that was churned out in the s with hundreds of guys in black suits but really not very good fight scenes in an interesting note dusty nelson the writer and director of sakura killers did another ninja film under the bonaire movie flag called white phantom i have no idea if this was meant to be a sequel to sakura killers but the sakura clan is once again a main feature including the same logo and similar story only this time including a white ninja this too while being mostly dire had a small sense of atmosphere but the fight scenes are even more sparce and to be frank are pretty awful so if you are a martial arts fan then give it a blast to kill a few hours
ok here is my personal list of top nicktoons shows as in today all grown up spongebob squarepants my life as a teenage robot invader zim catscratch rugratsnotice a word with only capital letters that means this is the nick show i m going to talk about catscratch is basically a simple but great animated comedy about three wealthy cats mr blik gordon and waffles who get into weird and really surreal situations from attempting to join human kimberely s slumber party for root beer to saving a planet of slugs from the evil spaceship this is one nick show that you will simply have your funny bone tickled sooner or later the theme song is catchy and memorable voice actors including wayne knight from the seinfield franchise brings the characters to fresh life with very quirky personalities the stories are enjoyable fans episodes would be king of all root beer and gordon s lucky claw and the humor is all done in some style of earthworm jim so in conclusion catscratch is one of the nicktoons series like invader zim and mlaatr which becomes very very popular all over the world in just seasons or less
i gave this film an with some reluctance as it s hard to praise something that so haunted and terrified me for years the sheer menace on the woman in black s face is just pure horror and the accompanying music just worsens the dread i saw this when it was first on tv when i was and it really did disturb me for years i m fascinated by the fact that so many other users have said this too so many movie reviews go on about how disturbing or terrifying a film might be but you can believe all those who have posted on this board this really is incredibly powerful stuff i mean i really like horror films and generally find them quite funny more often than not but this really is menacing and will probably disturb most people i haven t seen it since i was and i m tempted to watch it again but fear i might have some sleepless nights i can t quite put my finger on what it is exactly but i think it s something to do with the fact that fear is the woman s greatest weapon and that we as viewers are just as susceptible as we feel the fear so intensely it s remarkable that other viewers feelings are so unanimous i ve also seen the stage play which was an excellent production but nothing can compare to this
grand canyon falls under a very scarce category it is a very clever film with very clever dialogs and food for thought everywhere from start to end i have the impression that it never made it to it s deserved ranking and never will because of it s simplicity this kind of flick needs sensitive watchers pity thought that imdb makes me write ten lines because this is in no way necessary in this particular case anyway in order to fulfill this request i will tell you that the weak point of the film if any is in the acting not that it is bad but it could have been done much better exception made for kevin kline who was perfect go ahead and watch it
you d think you re in for some serious sightseeing when the premise of the movie takes place primarily between two characters as they travel miles or so from france to saudi arabia going through most of europe italy bulgaria croatia slovenia turkey before arriving in the middle east but this is not a tour and there are no stopovers for soaking in the sights reda s father is in his twilight years and wishes to do the haj however since walking and taking the mule is out of the question he chooses to travel to mecca by car he can t drive and therefore enlists the help of reda to his son s protest to get him there in their broken down vehicle but reda doesn t see the point of having him go along when his dad could opt for the plane he resents the idea of having put his personal life on hold for this pilgrimage he couldn t understand and hence we set off in this arduous journey with father and son being not the best of pals the beauty of this movie is to witness the development of the father and son pair the challenges they face the weird people they meet having to duke it out in varied weather conditions and alternating rest stops between motels and sleeping in the car we see an obvious generation gap in them trying to communicate to each other the father trying to impose on his son and the son trying to assert himself as an adult but circumstances we see reveal that reda is quite a fish out of water through the many encounters they actually team up quite well despite their differences it s perhaps quite apt to have this film released here last week to coincide with hari raya haji and having the opportunity to watch our protagonists join the other pilgrims in their haj the final scene in mecca is truly a sight to behold and you too would feel the claustrophobia and fear as reda tries to hunt down his dad amongst the thousands of people congregating the sights of europe were perhaps deliberately not dwelled upon so as to build up the anticipation of and focus on the final destination it certainly rang home the thought of telling and showing loved ones how much you appreciate them for who they are don t miss this and yes book early i was pleasantly surprised that this evening s session was still a full house
this movie is practically impossible to describe the alternate title don t look up is a lot more descriptive like most japanese cinema the story is not as linear as american the story revolves around a director who is filming a story about a ww deserter the set is haunted by an actress who died during the filming of a tv show back in the s the director is the only one who saw this show if you have seen ringu the director hideo nakata is the same and liked it you ll like ghost actress i loved ghost actress a lot more than ringu a truly scary and disturbing movie a
i have no idea what the other reviewer is talking about this was a wonderful movie and created a sense of the era that feels like time travel the characters are truly young mary is a strong match for byron claire is juvenile and a tad annoying polidori is a convincing beaten down sycophant all are beautiful curious and decadent not the frightening wrecks they are in gothic gothic works as an independent piece of shock film and i loved it for different reasons but this works like a merchant and ivory film and was from my readings the best capture of what the summer must have felt like romantic yes but completely rekindles my interest in the lives of shelley and byron every time i think about the film one of my all time favorites
i saw this film at the taos film festival last year and was just overwhelmed by it it s a rich warm novel brought to the screen beautifully acted and well directed more than anything it reminded me of the films of david lean both in its ability to handle a complex story and its knack for creating powerful scenes that affect you on several different levels the best movie i ve seen in years
i remember that i was a child when i first saw this movie it was my first horror movie maybe that s the reason why i can still remember some parts of it i don t remember much about acting nude scenes or other things but i do remember a male has head blown up with a grenade a male dismembered over a tree and a male run down by truck and shot in head todd schaefer kenny johnson and kevin mcparland i also remember the last scene when jennifer mcallister riped of the killer stomach to get the keys of the truck it s a movie that gives you the creep and it s worth a look but where do i find it how can i download it
this is a very intriguing short movie by david lynch and saying the name david lynch is probably enough for a lot of people this is your typical lynch short a blonde and a brunette are in a dark room the blonde has been crying the brunette is talking in a threatening way to the blonde and that s about it with a lot of silent moments but with the haunting music from angelo badalamenti there is a strange form of suspense this short feels a little like mulholland dr a movie i loved and therefore i liked this one as well it is probably especially for lynch fans but there is a chance you like this

walking with cavemen hosted by alec baldwin is a look back at all the hominid that s us species of the past million years who they were what they were like and how they died out along with being a very interesting scientific look at the information we have on these species walking with cavemen also examines what it is that makes us human i waited several weeks to watch this and i was not disappointed
actor paxton made his directorial debut with this chilling dark and competently made thriller about a widowed mechanic paxton himself who ropes his two sons into participating in savage ax murders claiming that the victims are not human beings at all but demons and that they have been selected by god to destroy these demons this is all told in flashback by one of the sons now grown up matthew mcconaughey to skeptical fbi agent powers boothe hard to automatically forget this film better than most serial killer features it s a twisty and unsettling tale told in straightforward fashion with a bare minimum of cinema gimmicks paxton commendably barely shows any blood at all until near the end well acted by all especially the two child actors jeremy sumpter of the recent peter pan and matt o leary of spy kids and domestic disturbance the only reason i deducted any points at all is because i can understand that some people may find all of this hard to stomach in any event it s an atypical thriller with a decent script
in what will probably find itself on my list of fuller s best movies that is once i see more of them that just this and shock corridor pickup on south street is a film noir where the femme fatale as well as the male protagonist are not the stereotypical ones in the genre like most of his other works fuller injects his own experiences and the sense of new york style that is usually absent in the hollywood noirs on a small budget at least for the likes of darryl f zanuck fuller and his actors create personas that are likable even in such a dark atmosphere the good guys are basically the ones who won t get violent with you even as they re looking for an extra buck richard widmark jean peters and thelma ritter are all terrific in the lead parts widmark is one only a few actors i can think of who could ve really pulled off this character he s a little like bugs bunny as he can be a wise ass who is a little sneaky on the other hand the character of skip mccoy does have a set of values in his life he doesn t go into other people s affairs and doesn t try and care about much of the working world outside of his little shack on the river after being sent away for three years he slips up unbeknownst to him when he pickpockets a woman peters on the train and lifts an item that s under the eye of the government it may have some secrets that could make him a lot of money but at what cost is the centerpiece of the film as it involves stoolie moe ritter is one of the finest and most believable character actors from the period the woman s ex a volatile kiley and the police department aside from the thematic elements which are told with a keen dramatic journalistic style as was fuller s previous position along with boxer the dialog is fresh and involving there s a spontaneity in many of fuller s camera moves and what a third act this is a lean tight film noir that is worth checking out even if you re not familiar with fuller it s comparatively less bizarre than some of his later works
when i rented this movie to watch it i knew that it was not going to be a mindbender movie instead i thought of it as a disbelief of reality where someone is going to get a serious beating and you know what it worked kurt russel did what i though was a remarkable role in showing the emotionless soldier that he was i recommend this movie if your out with the boys and want to watch a good action film
as i am always looking for something new and unique i watched this film online i thought that it would be just another b rate movie but i was amazed at the acting by the two main characters all of the actors in this film were very capable and well directed the plot was wonderful and unique as well with an excellent moral to the story this movie is definitely not for someone looking for a sex romp dumb and dumber or blood and guts this is a wonderfully poignant film showing some grim realities of life coupled with the kindness of the human heart and just enough frivolity to keep it interesting i would prefer this movie to many a rate movies i have seen even a great number with high box office earnings i highly recommend this movie
teresa pavlinek was a popular member of the toronto second city cast she has done numerous guest spots and commercials up here in canada finally someone has the sense to create a show for her the supporting case seems quite good too i have now watched the pilot several times and i still find it refreshing though i am not sure why the show is listed as the jane show i might be wrong but as far as i am aware the show was conceptualized in and appeared on global tv in canada in early it is a fresh idea and hopefully it does well too bad this couldn t be paired up with corner gas now i know corner gas is on ctv but the two shows would be great companion pieces
i suppose the ultimate curse of attending the toronto film festival is your release date time table get messed up quite frankly i m just happy fido got picked up for us distribution in any case ever seen shaun of the dead good how about lassie able to reconcile the two well if you can your name might be andrew currie canadian helmer of the first ever family themed zombie comedy or zomedy seriously that s what the press book in toronto called it though not as violent dry or british as shaun of the dead fido remains true to its roots a devotion to old s black and white television including both lassie and the infamous sci fi pulp that was being pumped out during the period fido s talented headliners carrie anne moss billy connelly dylan baker and tim blake nelson stand as a testament to the brilliance of the script the film explores all the implications of its premise a world where zombies have been converted to servants because of the sheer number of them due to a strange accident what would you use your new undead servant for a butler manual labor a pet unspeakable acts fido tackles all these possibilities in a sweet and surprisingly classy way with much thanks to the work of connelly as one of said zombies and young tv actor k sun ray who seems at times to be a better young elijah wood than the young elijah wood was if you re expecting another shaun of the dead don t waste your time there s not nearly enough gore and pokes at the genre to satisfy you and you ll just leave the theater bitter and depressed but if you re willing to take a look at what happens to shaun of the dead when it jumps across the lake you re in for a treat think of fido as the sensitive more often beaten up little brother to shaun of the dead s rebellious loser and you re starting to get the drift if you like or at least tolerate zombies small children and loads of deadpan satire fido s the film for you if that s not the case well you know the drill just hit em square between the eyes
once again proving his amazing versatility john turturro plays the introspective russian chess genius preparing for a comeback tournament and forging an unlikely relationship with a gadabout fellow resident emily watson at a s italian hotel they fall in love to the horror of her social mountaineering mother geraldine james a wonderful love story whose gloss of chess might make it appear cerebral but in spite of its origins in a nabakov story it certainly is not the romantic elements and the sense of time and place beat the psychological analysis hands down john turturro having appeared in barton fink o brother where art thou the big lebowski proves that he is not dependant on coen bros films to assert his stature
this was a highly original decent movie and a brave move for all those involved i don t care if it s not the most well put together movie of all time the fact that it has eddie murphy doing something non formulaic and that i don t know what will happen next makes it a favorite of mine i wish more movies were as imaginative as this one rather than the same old formula for entertainment
first i want to clarify that the average user s inability to appreciate imagination is appalling what makes this show so unique is the hyper reality it creates you don t need to know why ned can bring people back from the dead or why it can only be for a minute where has the wonderment of childhood whimsical tales gone much like a wrinkle in time i say it is refreshingly original because it is a polar opposite to the masses of lay it all out television that leaves no room for imagination or wonder it s nice to add a bit of escapism to the television experience the hyper reality is my favorite aspect of the show the s esque setting the innocent and rare characters and the scenery and physical setting which are not meant to be taken as pure reality this show masks the morbid nature of death while others embrace it while entertaining other television shows have taken a back shelf to this series it truly has restored a sense of curiosity imagination and wonder to television pushing daisies quickly made it to the top of my list
the notorious bettie page written by mary harron guinevere turner directed by mary harronhow do you define a person who has always been between two worlds one of presumed sin and one of supposed redemption especially when that person eventually succumbed to a split personality disorder in her latter years as if to demonstrate her own point if you re director mary harron you don t shy away from showing the push pull nature of the notorious bettie page you allow the character to drift back and forth between the healing forgiveness of the power of god and the church and the seductive illusion of control and dominance afforded to page during her years as a pinup model by doing so audiences are offered a complex character that is propelled forward by a desire to leave her difficult past with a naive enjoyment in others lust for her and a struggle to reconcile her image in the eyes of god come the right time it will no longer matter how many eyes are on her because there is only one pair that counts shot mostly in black and white with some unnecessary bursts of color the notorious bettie page is at times a light humorous comedy making the film an enjoyable experience and also one that pokes fun at how seriously people believe in the corruption of pornography but the delicate hand of the director is more palpably felt during page s times of despair harron is a sensitive considerate director who does not throw page s numerous and devastating blows of abuse in the face of her viewer instead she allows the surprisingly effective gretchen moll who plays the title role the chance to hammer the pain of her character into the viewer with fear in her eyes exhaustion is her cries and shame on her skin whereas most directors perhaps most male directors would find it essential to show the heroine in painful positions in order to draw a link between the kinds of atrocities that were put upon her and where her life took her harron has too much compassion for her character her actress and her audience from fragility page learns to trust people again and as more and more photographers fall in love with her image the more she falls in love with their admiration and the control she has over the gaze by the time her poses cross over into the realm of soft core s m she has found a way to combine her need to be respected with the objectification she has been accustomed to her whole life mary harron s bettie page is a woman who yearns for control over her life and destiny yet ultimately is always being told where to stand how to smile and what to wear when she finally realizes that none of her choices have been her own she chooses to embrace god and preach his word to those who will listen the true sadness behind this most important decision is that she is still letting someone else guide her blindly she just has more faith that this direction will be better for her soul
everything is relative seems to be the main theme from the outset by this set of eleven pieces by eleven directors that is to say that what might be number one priority for people like bush blair and company may not be so for a great many other people ordinary people from the opening scene in which an iranian teacher is trying to impress on her little students the most important thing that has happened with the result the children are not impressed as the death of a neighbour and things like that evidently affect them much more closely than anything which may have happened in new york usa wherever that is this series of almost documentary styled pieces establishes that not all things are as equal unto all men as some world leaders would try to prophess whereas obviously the attack on the wtc was a dastardly event by any yardstick one does get the impression that both politicians and tv cameramen tend to blow up things out of all proportion wonderfully manifested in one of these pieces would the same reaction at international level have occurred if the attack had been made on lagos say or djakarta say or even on rio de janeiro say i rather think not news seems to suffer distortion depending on where things happen much more tv time is given to an earthquake in italy say than one ten times more destructive in outer mongolia say greater distances seem to decrease the magnitude of the disaster this series of eleven pieces helps to put things in better perspective or perhaps i should say some of the pieces do as each director with complete freedom has made up his own story his own translated perspective such that it is not possible to judge the whole merits but individually for each eleven minute segment in no way should one deduce that this is an anti american film that would be a too simple reading of the diverse messages manifested through the segments however it is not pro american either the eleven segments adopt varied attitudes and the common link if there is one is that the disaster of the wtc attack has to be seen in perspective from different view points only then will such people as george bush even begin to comprehend the planet he is living on clearly stated in one segment is a belief of mine i have been harbouring for two years now america has not learnt the lesson and the lesson is that the usa has to share this planet with the rest of humanity not dominate it by ruthless economical persuasion or just plain force instead of learning that the usa cannot continue just stamping all over everybody and everywhere its political leaders aided and abetted by blair and even aznar have become even more arrogant and even more intolerant which is not doing any good to anyone in afghanistan or irak at present let alone much elsewhere the white house mentality is totally rejectable the us and uk invaded irak and caused all the chaos and so should clear up the mess they caused not insist on the un and other nations to delve in with a helping hand and thus find an easy way out of the turmoil radical stances adopted by the us or even israel is only going to be met by radical stances from islamic people who for years have been gearing up fanatical fundamentalism if only to cover up their own macho uselessness i e stoning women to death or simply shrouding them from the tops of their heads to the dusty ground the world is in a terrible mess fueled by the greed of a few rich countries who seem bent on not seeing or understanding anything from more multilateral perspectives this film in eleven separate pieces accurately portrays this dismal and dumb posture
i d read about flavia the heretic for many years but i only got to see it early last year when i went on an insane movie buying binge and for whatever reason it has been on my mind lately though it s been some months since i watched it it s a striking film set in italy somewhere around the th century definitely medieval era though i don t think any specific year is ever given this being the time of christian ascendancy the age is a time of utter madness and the movie captures this very well flavia our protagonist is a young lady who encounters a fallen muslim on a battlefield he seems a warm and intriguing fellow and she s immediately taken with him her father a soldier of a a family of some standing comes along almost immediately and murders the wounded man right before her eyes but she ll continue to see him in her dreams her father ships her off to a convent that seems more like an open air insane asylum the residents so harshly repressed by unyielding medieval christianity slowly go mad flavia comes under the influence of one of the nuttier nuns but in a mad world only the sane are truly mad and this sociopathic sister clearly recognizes the insanity around her her take on the times in which they live strikes a chord with flavia who being young and apparently sheltered is beginning to question everything about this world in which she finds herself trapped the movie is unflinching in its portrayal of that world showcasing a lot of unpleasantness we see a horse gelded a lord rape one of the women of his lands in a pig sty the pious torture of a young nun through it all flavia observes and questions rejecting eventually the christian dogma that creates such a parade of horrors in terms that would gain the movie some criticism over the years for seeming anachronistic i disagree with that criticism flavia s views though sometimes expressed in ways that vaguely mirror for example then contemporary feminist commentary the movie was made in revolve around what are really pretty obvious questions it is perhaps difficult to believe she could be so much of a fish out of water in her own time but that s the sort of minor point it doesn t do to belabor flavia is written in such a way to allow those of our era or of any era to empathize with her plight getting bogged down on such a matter would be missing the forest for the trees flavia is heartened when the muslims arrive invading the countryside and she finds in their leader a new version of the handsome islamist who still visits her dreams smitten with her almost immediately he allows her to virtually lead his army becoming a joan of arc figure in full battle gear and directing the invaders to pull down christian society and wreak vengeance upon all those she s seen commit evil is she the herald of a new and better world she may think so but muslims of that era weren t big on feminism either as she soon learns the hard way as they say meet the new boss this is really just a thumbnail of some of the things that happen in flavia the heretic the movie is quite grim and with a very downbeat rather depressing ending not a mass audience movie at all to be sure it s quite good though and doesn t belong on the nunsploitation pile on which it is often carelessly thrown i think there s much value in the final film and i m glad i saw it
bill and ted s bogus journey is possible the most excellent film i have ever watched though the acting and scenery etc is poor who cares the story line is brilliant and the jokes and words they come up with are most excellent the ideas are great as well i recommend anyone to see this classic the best part is obviously when they melvin death i was cracking up for minutes and missed the next part of the film this is so much better then the first one which was great as well possibly the funniest movie of all time i think the best parts of the film however are when bill and ted shout excellent and play the guitar solo it was hilarious rock on bill ted and eddie van halen bring out a rd film
if you like star wars trek come see where they got all their ideas and cinematic devices it s my top favorite movies of all times other worldly futuristic and psycho thriller the intensity of the root material shakespeare s the tempest is not overshadowed by whizbang gimmickry a la later lucas and just because it was made in don t assume you can see the strings holding the flying saucer up this was the first movie where you couldn t miracle it was made at a movie scale economics and tastes at the time were stacked heavily against it and director wilcox s previous hit was lassie come home until i looked him up i assumed fred wilcox was a pseudonym for a director who was already or later became famous but at the time didn t want to be associated with sci fi which was strictly a b genre back then this was either a very very visionary production or a very fortuitous mistake on the part of the folks who bankroll hollywood there are the massive scale mattes with live action almost microscopically inserted that lucas used extensively there are intelligent machines that transcend the stereotypical user interface computers as they ve come to be portrayed much less futuristically in later works star trek s transporter is there visually almost unaltered by roddenberry years later and if the trek wars technobabble turns you off fp s scientific references are not overdone and are all accurate even today the ship set is comprehensive sparklingly realistic as good as anything you ve seen since and more convincing than anything trek has done for tv or film we didn t get to spend as much time there as i would have liked if you ever wondered how movies got into space so competently watching fp will explain all that it s definitely not wagontrain to the stars
i doubt much of this film is based on a true story at the beginning it says based on a true story sort of i bet the only truth to it was there was an ex model turned bounty hunter possibly named domino anyways it begins with domino talking to lucy liu who works for the fbi domino is being interrogated about what she knows about a theft of million dollars through flashbacks we see domino as a child then as a model and how she became interested in being a bounty hunter she basically tells other bounty hunters off ed and choco they let her join the group she s tough can use any kind of weapon and will use her good looks if needed they get involved with a scam that clarmont a bailsman has going along the way the group starts a reality tv show and that s where ian zering and brian austin green become involved they are sort of like hosts and must have been really desperate to appear in this i thought the story was entertaining and it had some laughs the editing didn t bother me there s also a lot of violence mainly using guns and blood it could have been a little shorter final verdict good enough to watch
i really liked the film at ending i was in tears this film is incredible go watch the movie you will enjoy it i could have given it ranking more than i liked the teasing between chance and sassy i like the leadership of shadow overall this movie was perfect its sequel is good but not good as this movie i think there should be a third sequel to it not only this film attracts children but also adults my whole family enjoyed this film chance was full of humor sassy is an intelligent cat again i say this movie is a must watch the more u see this movie the more you are attached with this movie this movie is a classic
the book on which this movie is based was excellent it took a while to come to grips with houellebecq s unconventional style but once i understood the mood behind the writing i was completely drawn into the author s world of sadness in fact no other book has affected me so much this is not necessarily a good thing it elucidated my own personal struggle and has made the futility of my own struggle harder to accept houellebecq s insights are masterfully captured by harel and the hero s apathy and indifference to a world which has rejected him is perfectly portrayed this is a movie which reveals today s society for the lowly male in all its horror hopefully things will change in the future but for the present we have to accept the rat race as shown in this movie it s probably best that harel or houellebecq do not create a work of genius like this again one is enough for any man
i really loved this film yes i know it was fairly far fetched there is no way that shelby car could have managed to stay on the road as well as the i with all it s traction control and other gizmos but other than that the whole film was well put together cage was excellent as usual and the rest of the cast were also pretty good with the exception of the brit bad guy he was a little too much don t you think anyway great film great cars and great acting i for one made sure my car was locked and alarmed in my remotely controlled garage that night
this is a cleaver film featuring love through the ages the film consists of keaton seeking out a lady love in the stone age in ancient rome and in the present s in all three cases he is the usual wimpy buster and he battles against wallace beery for his lady love of the three time periods i think i liked the roman one best even though i admit it might have also been the cheesiest i actually liked the scenes with the lion that was obviously a guy in a costume as well as the weird chariot race in the snow but what i really enjoyed the most was seeing all of keaton s amazing acrobatics however all three time periods were good old fashioned fun and the film while not his best is still an exceptional and enjoyable film check it out
i think that this film is brilliant there are many reasons why but these are some of them the good acting by tom and tyler brilliant machine gun scene that was a piece of brilliance i thought that the ending was a good twist because i never expected that at the end all credit to sam mendes as well as a these points the film form of the film is good as well i am a film student at college and we studied this film in great detail and it was one of the best films i have seen in many years i d just like to say a big thank you to all of the people involved in making this film lastly i would like to say the best scene in the film is the machine gun scene where john rooney gets kill it is just pure brilliance in shooting the scene in silence until john rooney says i m glad it s you it is a lot better like that i think because the viewer creates there own sound and that sound is totally different for every viewer just brilliant thank you for reading this comment written by ross kirk aged
this movie is not a kung fu movie this is a comedy about kung fu and if before making this film sammo hung hadn t spent some time watching films by the great french comic filmmaker jaques tati i ie e g esp jour de f te he is certainly on the same wave length personally i think tati s films are hilarious but they re not to all tastes some have told me that they loathe his work i ve never figured out why but i think it s because the character that tati usually plays himself is so totally dead pan so unaffected by the events around him which he is usually causing that many miss the more subtle comic bits happening around him at any rate tati s main shtick or at least his best known is to take a pretentiously upright petite bourgeoisie with th century sensibilities and drop him into th century france where he must confront a society that is largely defined by the gradual eroding of those sensibilities he usually has serious difficulties with little things like record players or radios he s a hazard in a car but the world s no safer when he rides a bicycle but through it all he never loses his aplomb which is derived from his inner recognition that the nineteenth century was more interesting than the th overall in a similar fashion the character sammo hung himself plays is a country boy come to the big city of hong kong utterly convinced that what makes the city interesting is that bruce lee made kung fu movies there this gets him into trouble in small ways since he takes in stride happenstance which would never be noticed in a small town but which are deemed inappropriate in a big city such as the moment when he appears to be urinating in the street a cop stops him only to discover that hung is actually just squeezing water out of his shirt soaked during an accidental dip in the bay what s interesting about this gag is why it is hung doesn t understand what the cop s fuss is all about in a country town as long as no one s looking if you gotta go you gotta go in other words hung is not really urinating in the street but he certainly would and what s the problem officer of course hung s obsession with bruce lee also gets him into big troubles as well he beats a gang of thugs who have refused to pay his restaurant owner uncle of course in a bruce lee movie the thugs would be considered trounced and they would have learned their lesson but in hung s hong kong reality unfortunately prevails and the thugs return when he s not around to trounce his uncle of course hung finally triumphs in the end just as tati always did characters like this must always triumph at least in comedy because they are completely innocent and as such despite their comic missteps and misunderstandings they really represent what is best in the humans we admire and wish to be we don t really want to be bruce lee who has to experience the loss of all of his friends before he gets a chance to beat the bad guy we in our own innocence really want a world where lee s heroics are possible unfortunately that world only exists on film ah but what if and in that question we find sammo hung at his comic best
this is one of the best films ever made it is a realistic depiction of rural ranching life which was a big part of american history the setting is wyoming where life had not changed much since the previous century the film keeps your interest without the added hollywood myths the whole family can see this movie and be intrigued about how life was like in america when it was mostly a rural nation with this film you will escape the present and witness the daily life of years ago in a beautiful scenic environment you will see the hard physical work that was required to survive as well as the constant worries and concerns of the elements and the market pressures that will make a difference between success or failure see this movie and experience life as it was for most of our nation s history this film is worth your time to see my only question is why aren t there more films like this one
a murder investigation goes on back stage while the vanities on its opening night plays on to an unknowing audience odd combination of musical and murder mystery is worth a look for its cast its production numbers and the sheer novelty of the film gertrude michael has the showy role of a bitchy actress intent on stopping the marriage between the show s stars kitty carlisle and carl brisson as well as starring in the infamous sweet marijuana number which was also on a s bette midler album so while the chorus girls shuffle around backstage bumbling detective victor mclaglen ogles the girls while he tries to solve the backstage murder of an unknown woman we quickly learn that the maid dorothy stickney loves brisson from afar that the wardrobe lady jessie ralph is brisson s mother and that the stage manager jack oakie butts into everything lots of plots twists among the musical numbers the show s best known song is cocktails for two kitty carlisle also sings the haunting where do they come from and there s a weird rhapsody that erupts into a harlem specialty number featuring duke ellington quite the cast some terrific acting here especially gertrude michael and dorothy stickney kitty carlisle is quite good as well brisson is a total zero though charles middleton plays homer toby wing plays nancy donald meek plays the doctor and also see if you can spot ann sheridan and lucille ball among the show girls
ok this movie is stupid i mean that in a good way though it was stupid on purpose and was one of the better stupid movies i ve seen the jokes and gags are purposefully bad but delivered in a way that it struck all the right notes with me the supporting characters were pretty shallow and mediocre there is a pretty weak plot but it works just fine elvira s character is the focus here she is lovable and adorable cassandra petersen has a world of acting talent that just glows in this movie on top of that acting talent she had physical attributes which were frankly stunning few men could disagree with that the parts that show off her figure were also some of the funnier scenes in the movie i had a smile ear to ear from the first scene to the last highly recommended to fans of comedy and to fans of beautiful women i wish they had made a dozen more elvia movies
spoilers my dad had taped this movie for me when i was by age i had watched it over times i just watched it and watched it and i still do today it has a grim storyline a lamb s mother is killed by a wolf a very emotional scene and wants to become a wolf like him after years of training the lamb is made into a really really evil looking thing he and the wolf travel to his old barn but he cannot kill the lambs no matter how much he wishes to he ends up killing the wolf but is no longer seen as a lamb by his former friends and can t return to his previous way of life the art is beautiful the songs are well okay and the voice acting is better than some things today all in all you just have to see this movie it is a great masterpiece although it s very hard to find today
i first saw this film when i was about it blew me away then and in many respects it still does now but i am less inclined to see it as an accurate historical piece now there is precious little effort made to examine and interact with the racism and thus fails to recognise that the most potent anti racism weapon is to understand it at its very core in those who commit it what we get instead is a dichotomy on the one side beko and woods in d panoramic rainbow vision on the other two dimensional characters are portrayed as unapologetic unthinking evil this all makes for a great film story but it worries me that people see the portrayal as accurate
my discovery of the cinema of jan svankmajer opened my eyes to a whole tradition of czech animation of which jir trnka was a pioneer his ruka is one of the finest most technically impressive animated movies i ve ever seen a potter wakes up and waters his plant then he goes about making a pot but in comes the huge hand which crashes the pot and demands that the potter make a statue of itself he casts the hand out but soon it returns and imprisons him in a bird cage where he s forced to sculpt a stone hand he sets about it fainting from exhaustion but eventually completes the task in a marvellous sequence of metacinema the potter uses a candle to burn his visible puppet strings which keep him in thrall and he escapes back home he shuts himself in and is accidentally killed by his own beloved plant when it falls on his head this movie doesn t hide the fact it s pure animation unlike modern movies that strive to be realistic why the hand for instance is clearly someone s hand in a glove everything else is clay strings are visible and are part of the narrative making it a precursor of the movie strings the atmosphere is eerie that hand going after the little potter managed to instill more dread in me than many horror movies combined the movie is obvious but it avoids being totally manipulative for its simplicity it s a fable about artistic freedom and tyranny which can t help winning the heart and mind of anyone who holds freedom as a natural right
the scintillating elizabeth taylor stars in this lesser known classic as a young girl from london who falls in love with a tea plantation owner from british ceylon current day sri lanka upon arrival she instantly feels out of place and is forced to adapt to the new culture as well as be in constant awareness of the angry elephant herd william dieterle who also directed the life of emile zola and portrait of jennie does a masterful job of bringing a somewhat dark and almost eerie undertone to this romance and the setting is one of the most beautiful i ve seen with the black and white themed mansion and the gorgeous island scenery
i can t say that this film deserves anywhere near the amount of vitriol being heaped on it by some reviewers yes it s bogged down by an overly padded running time hamfisted editing and an overreliance on cheeseball special effects and it lacks much of the energy a comedy needs to get your average audience member to sit through it without checking his or her watch on the other hand it s also got some laugh out loud funny lines a talented and earnest cast and the classic underdog premise macy stiller and azaria are brilliant as the core team and garofalo and studi do superb work adding conflict and variety to the team i can t say reubens or mitchell added much to the film overall though each had a few chances to shine the plot as i said above is your classic underdog makes good stuff no surprises there since you know they re going to triumph what makes it worthwhile is not the absurd gaudy heroes and villains but the dialogue and interplay between the characters underneath it all these people are children at heart who just want to do right the best scenes in the film give this film its emotional grounding look at azaria s relationship with his long suffering mother macy s endearing innocence in his unwillingness to accept cap amazing s secret identity stiller s rage not unlike that one weird spazzy kid you once knew who d always go into quivering impotent rages on the playground garofalo s desire to avenge her father this childlike belief that a sense of justice and goodness will always make the world a better place is the true appeal of super hero comics and underneath its parodic exterior mystery men shows us why these hackneyed comic book tropes matter to so many it never really gels into a satisfying whole due to the huge number of half baked subplots romance family life conflicts within the team etc but the main plot is such loopy fun that it makes up for that the fact that it s supposed to be good nonsensical fun seems to be lost on some of the reviewers here so i ll issue a caveat if you re the type of viewer who finds his enjoyment of an itchy and scratchy cartoon ruined by the unexplained and illogical am i to believe this is some sort of snort magic xylophone then you are far too literal minded and humorless for this film go rent a sandler film instead

i thought that the sentinel was going to be a mediocre movie when i finally saw it i took a good surprise the movie isn t great thing but it s very fun and the action scenes are very well done this movie reminded me tv series like or alias it s very similar to that series and it reminded me too to the wolfgang petersen s thriller in the line of fire if you re going to expect one of the most original and and one of the greatest thrillers in the history of movies you will be disappointed but if you go with little expectations you will enjoy the sentinel rating
things to come is an historic film along with metropolis it stands as one of the first great science fiction spectacles it is also one of the first doomsday movies it is remarkable how the filmmakers predict the start of the second world war within a year and even in a subtle way the year it would end in the real world but then the film departs from reality depicting a world ravaged by war only substitute poison gas for nuclear weapons which of course did not exist in the last half hour of the film is an incredible sight making groundbreaking use of models and matte paintings later to become staples of the science fiction genre it is sad that after things to come sci fi would become identified with cheaply made b movies a stereotype that wouldn t be broken until a space odyssey more than years later if they d stuck with the quality of the effects in this film things would have been very different in hollywood raymond massey and some of his co stars play multiple roles in this film to good effect massey plays a great doctor who like role as a pilot from an advanced for civilization who tries to win over the populace of a devastated country ruled by a simple minded warlord a very effective performance by ralph richardson ultimately the storyline covers years but that s a big problem with this film there really isn t a cohesive storyline perhaps in such an episodic film somewhat reminiscent of intolerance actually it s hard to have a conventional plot but i felt more could have been made of the material and although the visuals in the final third of the picture are indeed stunning and worth the price of admission the plot is nonexistent and the movie itself suddenly ends just as it is getting interesting maybe the producers were thinking of another future sci fi innovation a sequel things to come is a film every serious sci fi buff should see at least once unlike metropolis however it might not bear repeated viewings
otto preminger completing a noir cycle at twentieth century fox reunited his laura leads for this stark gritty detective drama dana andrews again portrays a cop but this time he s hardened cynical and has been accused of police brutality by his superior you don t hate hoods you liked to beat them up mark dixon andrews despises criminals as his own father was a crook he doesn t want to be sandy dixon s kid so he became a policeman but his methods are harsh and hated one night investigating a murder he unknowingly punches a suspect ken paine craig stevens so hard that it kills him a shaken dixon does his best to cover it up intending to frame a hated thug scalise gary merrill for the crime however the blame falls on paine s father in law jiggs taylor tom tully whose daughter department store model morgan taylor tierney is estranged from her husband but keeps getting drawn into his gambling schemes paine had slapped his wife enraging her father who did show up at his son in law s apartment but not until dixon had departed with the body with no better suspects jiggs is arrested and charged riddled with guilt mark falls for morgan and offers money for an attorney he decides to take on scalise anyway but leaves a letter to be given to the department in the event of his death confessing everything in the end he cannot live with the knowledge with what he has done and he permits the letter to be read by his superior and by morgan despite all the tragic circumstances morgan professes her love for mark and will wait for him it was great to find this film on dvd after so many years of televised obscurity eddie mueller a film noir historian provides the commentary and does a good job but i find his assertion that audiences wouldn t have caught the significance of the casting of the two leads since laura had been made six years earlier in that respect he is mistaken because they had appeared in the iron curtain two years prior to wtse and the film was a box office success andrews and tierney were fabulous together and ruth donnelly is tremendous comic relief as restaurant owner martha fanning the flames between the detective and the dame the night cityscapes give the film an air of menace gary merrill is great as the low life scalise who had a criminal past with dixon s dad your father liked me he taunts mark karl malden and a young neville brand are terrific also and tom tully is just touching and funny as morgan s unjustly accused pop a watchable film noir with a fantastic cast
pushing daisies for sure is one of the best tv shows of its genre in the last years agree you with that or not bryan fuller the creator has an amazing creative mind he s the mind behind other great tv shows as dead like me wonderfalls and the other one not as great as these ones but also interesting heroes it s a mix of the marvelous worlds brian fuller created in previous tv shows mixing once again an amazing fantasy world with real kinds of people disguised into colorful images and exaggerated feelings something that a fairytale always is so being a kind of fairytale you cannot expect more than a unrealistic world and unexpected situations or also situations a lot expected but not in a way that it would usually be told a gift always comes with a curse and what is sweet can also be bitter that s so ned lee pace the piemaker is a simple guy with an interesting gift other than being an amazing chef he can give life to the dead with just a touch this could be a power that everybody would die or live for if wasn t for another simple and very sad thing he can also gives the forever dead if he touches it again the curse of this amazing gift doesn t stops there everything has a compensation and if he brings anything to life for more than one minute another specie of that one would die instantly he s a guy full of unfortunate events in life in a way that he grown up introspectively always afraid to touch everything and lose once more things he one day used to love till the day he could finally be close to his biggest childhood love chuck anna friel if wasn t for another sad fact she was dead he gave her life again and she loves him so much as he does but this love is untouchable the truly kiss of death and that s how this beautiful modern fairytale starts when i heard about pushing daisies for the first time it was promoted as something very familiar or maybe some kind of tribute to everything that tim burton has created since pee wee s big adventure to big fish and charlie and the cholate factory the results could not be better the world around the pie hole was magnificent the stories around ned and detective cod chi mcbride to solve unsolved crimes can be a lot common in tv but this is just a way to guide people thru amazing stories surrounding characters as chuck and olive kristin chenoweth in a wonderful world full of beautiful and dreamy images that you can almost sense the taste of the colors not only that you are merged into a bunch of amazing and charismatic gentle characters even those ones with the most deep dark humors forgetting the trivial concept of murders and unsolved crimes the show brights and is triumphant in a lot of other things the actors here are top of note lee pace is tender soft and contained as the character asks for anna friel is the muse of the show as her character is supposed to be but the most superb times are always with the supporting actors as chi mcbride detective emmerson cod swoozie kurtz as lilly charles ellen greene as vivian charles and kristin chenoweth as olive snook swoozie kurtz shines performing a so dried character drowned in a impossible dark humor that could frighten a clown for sure she has the best dialogs and her expressions and body languages are mesmerizing but if the best dialogs are given by swoozie and her character the best funny moments are given by kristin chenoweth seems that she s improvising all the time she s so naturally fun that every single scene is a show aside kristin shines so bright in the show that winning the emmy for her supporting role in the show was totally fair and deserved also there s the chemistry between actors and their characters that are also amazing there are no words to express what this tv show really is and what it was meant to be for those ones who think this show is a waste of time or claimed to find no sense in it for sure needs to open their minds and comeback to a time that they probably never had childhood truth be told tv has never been so daring in a tv show as with this amazing one pushing daisies was a huge step forward in terms of great artistic entertainment and its sudden death was a lot disrespectful it s true that tv doesn t respect great tv shows as those ones bryan fuller created except heroes that s still on air and is far from being so amazing as the other ones
when i was a kid of i always watched movies and television that i wasn t supposed to and this was one of them it s one of my favorite movies of all time and it has to be the funniest movie i have ever seen in my life the acting is excellent they don t make comedies like this anymore these days movies that are actually funny and make you laugh without resorting to excrement or some type of vomit inducing body fluid as in those retarded judd apatow movies starring unfunny non actors like seth rogen barf this movie is a classic with actors who can actually act and deserve all the accolades
the tenants began as a short novel by the now deceased bernard malamud writer philosopher examining the conflicts between jews and african americans in the incendiary atmosphere of brooklyn at the time the book was written as a novel the story was gut wrenchingly real as transcribed into a screenplay by novices david diamond and danny green who also directs it is more of a cerebral dissertation that gradually erupts into action in the final moments harry lesser dylan mcdermott is a jewish novelist with one book under his belt but currently attempting to finish his newest book ten years into the writing convinced that he must complete the novel in the same environment where it was started he is the sole tenant in a condemned brooklyn tenement owned by levinspiel seymour cassel who constantly tries to buy out harry s lease so that the filthy dilapidated building can be demolished into this atmosphere enters another black militant quasi anti semitic writer willie spearmint snoop dogg whom harry befriends hides and offers help to the nascent novelist s attempt to write about the death of all white people harry s attempts to help willie lead to conflict not the least of which is harry s meeting willie s girlfriend the white jewish irene bell rose byrne at a less than friendly gathering of willie s militant black brothers and sisters willie and irene are on the skids and harry gradually falls in love with irene and they plan to leave new york as soon as harry finishes his novel when willie hears of the assignation and is further critiqued by harry willie explodes and begins the downward descent of not only a delicate friendship but also a competition between writers the ending reveals the slippery nature of the human condition and the human capacity for violence and undoing the actors do their best with a script that is a bit awkward but despite scripted lines that border on preaching they create believable characters the cinematography enhances the story keeping the mood dank and dense and primarily confined to the condemned building the musical score appropriately makes use of the solo jazz trumpet and blues piano to underline the tension and isolation of each of these groundless characters though it takes some patience to make it through the cerebral ramblings the film in the end is worth watching at least it attempts to recreate malamud s bizarre look at life in the big city grady harp
the only reason i give this movie an out of is because there are few movies in my opinion that are perfect this little b picture is a taut story well told i ve always been intrigued by alexander knox but have seen him very few movies here he plays wilhelm grimm a sad little man who turns into a monster he betrays everything and everybody without an ounce of remorse the performance is one of the most chilling performances i ve ever seen since world war actors who played nazis or other evil types in films have occasionally been nominated for oscars i imagine that since this was made during the war the academy felt like honoring a performance like this would have been like honoring evil but knox puts in that kind of performance a man so bitter and consumed by guilt that he thinks nothing of making others suffer i still can t get over it marsha hunt who usually plays the filbert gibbet or social butterfly is cast against type in probably the best performance i ve ever seen her give too maybe not oscar worthy but the best of her career nothing against her i have enjoyed her in those slight roles she often played but here she proves she up to the task of heavier drama if you like human drama stories or stories about the fates of those who suffered at the hands of the nazis i highly recommend this fine little film
a message movie but a rather good one outstanding cast top to bottom interesting in that bette davis s plot line is essentially back story the extremely negative reviews name throwing at the screenplay playwright associating this somehow with extremely negative comments about angles in america etc etc object to the movie being too preachy about germany in wwii gosh that is just a bit too sophisticated an understanding of morality for me theatrical and movie making and acting styles vary over time and of course years later this particular movie would not be made in this way yes casablanca is a better movie i guess but although made in the same year and both having nazis in them casablanca is primarily a love story the love story in this movie takes second seat to the spy plot more of a thriller both have a rather large number of somewhat cheesy accents and wonderful character actors the children are a bit tedious and could have been edited
gabe ryan frankie thomas gets out of reform school and goes back to the slums his sister ann sheridan does her best to keep him out of trouble but it just seems to follow him aside from his associations with the termite gang gabe is followed by real life gangsters who have a scheme to set fire to random buildings to collect the insurance they need someone to blame for the arson and gabe is it it is up to the termites to work the law in their favor and give the gangsters their just desserts the the scene that introduces the dead end kids is really quite good the boys wander on over to the new resident s furniture on the street and proceed to make it their own they talk to each other in phoney posh accents and talk about drinking tea together bernard punsley takes a nap in a chair the boys then proceed to start a fight with the new boy but after he proves himself a good fighter they ask him to join their club the initiation scene is rather good too filled with mischief that seems dangerous at first but is really rather clever and innocent later when billy halop studies to become the boy mayor he has a dream about schoolwork this is wonderfully staged with tiny holograms of the kids walking on his face and firing questions at him angels wash their faces is a great title because it plays off of the success of angels with dirty faces and really tells what the kids are doing notorious for bad behavior on and off the set these boys make nice in this film but rather than seem disingenuous it makes for some great laughs this is a preview of what many of the boys would become in the bowery boys series we even get a few garbled words from leo gorcey
this recreation of the infamous murders in kansas based on the capote book is starkly filmed by brooks and cinematographer hall in black and white giving it a documentary feel there are good performances from blake and wilson as the killers and forsythe as a cop who pursues them the scenes leading up to the murders filmed at the actual house where the crime occurred with a soundtrack of whistling winds are quite intense and chilling brooks directs with a lot of verve and uses several interesting transitions between scenes the only complaint is that it is a bit overlong with the denouement dragged out and somewhat preachy
having to have someone hold your hand whenever walk up or down stairs having others taste your food before you eat it facing an over bearing mother these are only a few of the obstacles which the young victoria has to deal with in this film there s also the various power struggles going on as well as attempts on her life needless to say it makes for very fascinating and informative viewing i had only previously seen emily blunt in the devil wears prada and little else as she was in that film she is once again the standout here i was extremely impressed with her portrayal of the young victoria and thought she handled the role very well she makes the transition from the young victoria we meet at the start of the film to the queen victoria she becomes later entirely believable blunt is perfectly cast in the role showing all the different sides from the vulnerable to the strong from the young victoria who makes mistakes to the queen who takes control not enough can be said about emily blunt in this role she s quite simply exquisite commanding your attention every second she s on screen she keeps you transfixed up to and including the final shot of the film rupert friend proves to also be well cast as victoria s love interest and eventual husband prince albert the actors have nice chemistry and you absolutely believe in their developing relationship they have their disagreements but you can tell that they are in love blunt and friend are excellent in every scene that they share and keep you interested in what is happening between victoria and albert the other actors in the film are also very good paul bettany as lord melbourne miranda richardson as the duchess of kent mark strong as sir john conroy and jim broadbent as king william there is not a single bad performance in this film the less focused upon people are well portrayed also given what little screen time they have even victoria s dog a cavalier king charles spaniel named dash is memorable and makes an impact in the film although the movie does tend to skip more than a few aspects of victoria s life especially at the end and instead tells us what happened with her and albert on screen what matters the most is what we actually see this is after all a film about the young victoria not the middle aged victoria nor the old victoria while there are some embellishments made on history with this film it remains focused on what it sets out to do which is tell us the story of how the young princess rose to power the movie looks amazing the costumes emily blunt wears are visually stunning and the music only adds to the film never detracts from it it s exceptionally shot and unlike a lot of films these days this movie is actually a good length as it doesn t run on so long that you lose interest or feel that it s needlessly being drawn out it goes without saying that what makes this film so great is emily blunt she s in fine form here turning in another excellent performance and elevating this film above what it might have been had another actress been cast in this rather important historic role this is one finely crafted film with excellent performances that should definitely be seen if you have an appreciation for a fascinating look at a woman who was extremely significant in history this is a must see
i saw this movie with a bunch of friends and although only two of us walked out of the cinema thinking how cool it was the others just laughed and commented on how stupid it was well that was because it isn t supposed to be taken so seriously basically it is a a movie that mocks horror flicks and does a damn good job there seems to be another movie coming out like that too umm scary movie well this is aussie and original jessica napier does a surperb performance and sarah kants has a definate bright future in acting i hope to see more of them molly ringwald was a good move and kylie was an even better move the impossible princess was queen of the screen i recommend seeing this flick as you ll be guessing until the very end the connection with raffy hilary and the movie that never got finished years ago
i find alan jacobs review very accurate concerning the movie however i had the opportunity to rent the dvd from blockbuster with a commentary from byu s curator motion picture archives james d arc the then lds prophet heber j grant approved of the movie understanding the deviations from historic content for dramatic expression and telescoping events for example the movie showed joseph smith on trial despite brigham young s great oratory in defense of joseph smith he was convicted anyway then joseph was killed historically joseph smith was never convicted of anything brigham young was in boston when joseph smith was arrested for this particular trial joseph smith and his brother hyrum where both killed before the trial took place
i love this film the songs and story lines are great fun and the song saying goodbye always moves me what a brilliant thing to do to bring puppets to life in a way that you actually care about these things made of cloth and fabric and whatever great voices and great talent why were all the other muppet films that came after this one so much less interesting moving and funny is it that mr henson is just so very missed
the tv movie of the spirit was a pilot for a possible series however spirit creator will eisner did not like the film and thus no series was produced i thought it was a very entertaining film and captured the spirit sorry of the comic with a modern twist i m sorry it didn t materialize into a series sam flash gordon jones was a perfect spirit nana visitor was a nice ellen dolan and of course would later go on to star trek deep space nine years later maybe with the release of frank miller s big screen version of the spirit more people will be able to see this rare gem of spirit history it seems that when hollywood makes a film from an already established character or idea someone will inevitably seek out previous versions of the property and release it to video in order to make a few dollars when antonio banderas donned the mask of zorro we were able to get earlier versions of the masked hero on dvd such as the great alain delon version of the s although all copies i ever saw were badly edited heres hoping someone will release the tv adventure of the spirit to dvd soon
the father of the who s alcoholic drummer keith moon was named arthur i found so many similarities between dudley moore and keith moon in this movie liza minelli who usually overacts did quite a good job in this one and was able to turn cheek on dudley moore in every turn yes i agree sir john stole absolutely every scene it was a very different movie enabling the viewer to have a glimpse into another life we often try to catch a rerun of this movie on satellite god rest dudley moore this was such an enjoyable movie much satire and thumbs down to the rich and snobby affluent the close friendship between moore and sir john is rather endearing
the great talents of michael powell and emeric pressberger are noticeable in their wonderful a matter of life and death it was part of the recent tribute to mr powell that played at the walter reade in new york this film in particular shows us one of the best british films from that or any other era a matter of life and death has a brilliant cinematography by jack cardiff a man who knew how to work wonders with a camera particularly impressive is the contrast from the monochromatic tones given to the scenes played in heaven and the colored ones when the action comes back to earth this was quite a coup and well ahead of its times the black and white sequence that involves the long staircase where peter and the conductor are chatting has to be one of the most amazing things on any film much has been said in this forum about the film so our comment will be about the great acting powell and pressberger got out of the large distinguished cast who responded magnificently to the directors guidance david niven is peter whose aircraft is hit and his best friend dies as a result of it this film marked one of the highlights in mr niven s career he was an excellent film actor as he shows us in this movie kim hunter is surprisingly good as june the woman who talked to peter as his plane was falling from the skies as fate would have it peter and june fall in love at first sight some of the best british film actors grace this film with their presence robert coote is bob the man who is admitted to heaven but he is surprised his friend peter never made the trip with him an excellent star turn by marius goring who as the conductor steals the film mr goring who had worked with the directors is one of the best things in the movie also roger livesey as dr frank reeves does one of the best appearances of his career as well as raymond massey who is seen as abraham farlan a matter of life and death is a timeless film that will always be seen with gratitude toward its creators
my father grew grew up watching george reeves as superman and when i was a little kid he had episodes on vhs and let me view them including this movie passing them down in the family if you will and i loved it clark kent and lois lane get sent to a small town with and oil mine and from the mine emerge mole men radioactive and targeted by the town assumed to be deadly and it s up to superman to stop this mayhem it s just so wonderful and fun to view the old style special effects and sound the crew pulled off such a beauty with such little technology george reeves was my hero when i was a little kid and i m now it just goes to show how timeless and classic these adventures are
this movie has always been a favorite of mine since first seeing it as a year old kid in when it was shown on a los angeles television station s late show the characters are very engaging from the start of the picture and it is too bad that the movie has never been released for video tape nor is it ever shown on television apparently due to a prohibition by the estate of moss hart the playwright producer director who wrote the story and first presented it on the new york stage during wwii the reason for denying its showing is hard to fathom more than years after it was made i did not see the movie again for over years when someone who had actually been a major cast member of the movie was able to get me a bootlegged copy on vhs poor video quality but good audio my memory of it was correct it was still an engaging and fascinating movie to watch an amazing aspect of this film is just how many of its stars just starting out in their careers at the time went on to became either major motion picture stars or at least well known and fully employed actors e g judy holliday edmond o brien jeanne crain barry nelson don taylor karl malden peter lind hayes george superman reeves red buttons lee j cobb kevin mccarthy and gary merrill the scenes with the b liberators are terrific especially the close up shots where the details of the giant for those times engine bomber then manufactured now nearly extinct can be seen good insight into the different levels of training that a pilot cadet went through on his way to being assigned to a bomber crew of course very gender biased as was the trend of the day only the men became pilots the women just supported them in their roles hardly acceptable in today s world i hope someday it will be released onto video for a new generation to enjoy
in my opinion a guy thing is a hilarious witty sexy romantic and totally beautiful chick flick that guys will also enjoy i thought that jason lee and julia stiles dazzled as a bewildered groom to be and his soon to be sexy cousin in law if you ask me they lit up the screen like magic you can also feel their chemistry between them before i wrap this up i d like to say that the performances were top grade the direction was flawless the production design was nice the casting was perfect and the costumes were perfectly designed in conclusion to anyone who s a fan of jason lee or julia stiles i recommend this movie you re in for lots of laughs and thrills so go to the video store rent it or buy it kick back with a friend and watch it
i am actually outraged at the comment i read stating that this movie was boring and the beautiful scenery was marred by the black and white footage it was made in i think it absolutely incredible for it s time the journey that these people had to go through is utterly remarkable it took them a week just to cross a river the women carried their children in heavy wooden cradles on their backs climbing up a solid sheet of rock sometimes barefoot in the snow i would like to see anybody do that now i thought it was a wonderful film with some truly amazing shots and an incredible story
and anyone who watches this film will agree this film was directed in the days when plot character believability and theme actually mattered jean peters widmark and thelma ritter steal the spotlight ritter is in top form as informer moe she survives in the bowery section of ny acting as a stool pigeon for nyc police the only other film in which i have seen peters is niagara and she certainly proves her acting ability here complete with brooklyn accent widmark is appropriately menacing as the anti hero who must discern what the right thing is despite his need for cash the photography is brilliant the neon the subway station though it looks cleaner than the real thing the harbor shack where widmark lives as a transient excellent use is made of the city with lightning louie in chinatown the many flavors and appetites of the city are addressed here the political climate of the time is a haunting backdrop
my first fassbinder was a wonderful experience film and alternative cinema small hall with uncomfortable seats public had to wait while filmrolls were changed were perfect match there were many cliches used in the film but fassbinder presented them so cleverly that i found them really amusing sound was also brilliant sometimes back being louder than dialogue everything seemed to be in right place and i loved the way how after war time was presented real fun
i saw fever pitch sort of by accident it was playing on the airplane going over to europe it actually wasn t half bad ben jimmy fallon is the world s red sox fan but his relationship with lindsay meeks drew barrymore may strain that the movie is a fairly interesting look at how world events can affect peoples relationships it s especially eye opening now that the red sox have ended their odd year losing streak i guess that these sorts of things happen all the time and we just don t tend to notice them not too bad another movie portraying an unusual relation to baseball is s frequency check them both out
italy produced a lot of really great and original horror films in the s and this is certainly one of them the first thing you will notice about danse macabre is the style of the film shot in beautiful black and white and due to director antonio margheriti s use of lighting the film almost looks like it could be a german expressionistic horror film this coupled with the horror filled plot line ensures that danse macabre is a film that truly captures the essence of horror of course the fact that the beautiful barbara steele appears in the film doesn t harm matters and the good news continues as in this film she gets to flex her acting muscles more than she did in the films that made her famous the plot is very aware of the time in which this was released and so incorporates the great edgar allen poe we follow alan foster a writer who accepts a bet from poe himself and lord blackwood that he can t spend an entire night in the latter s creepy old castle everyone that has spent the night there previously has died and our hero is about to meet the previous wager takers nowadays horror films don t tend to focus so much on each shot and the result is that there isn t much beauty left in the genre it is refreshing therefore to see this film many of the shots here are incredibly beautiful from the female side of the couple wearing just a see through skirt to my personal favourite a shot of smoke creeping in from under a door this my first antonio margheriti film and even after seeing just this one it s obvious that he was one of italy s premier directors also interesting is the fact that screenplay was co written by another of the italian greats django creator sergio corbucci the plot can meander a little too much at times but there s always enough atmosphere on hand to make sure that the film never becomes boring and the fact that it is always intriguing even when the plot slows down ensures the same thing the way that danse macabre utilises the haunted house theme is both well done and original and helps to keep the story as eerie as possible on the whole fans of italian and or cult cinema will not want to miss this little gem
why did it sound like the husband kept calling her appy it ruined a great episode and so i can only give it a proper grammar and pronunciation are essential to a film it was very hellraiser what with all the skin ripping though i dunno how anyone can survive without skin the skin is a vital organ to the body the biggest organ actually and without we would die the more a horror film is true the more creepy it can be and more entertaining i do admit though that the stories from the great horror directors are very disappointing and very mediocre come on yankies get your english up to par
dressed to kill starts off with kate miller angie dickinson having a sexually explicit nightmare later on that day she visits her psychiatrist dr robert elliott michael caine for a session in which she admits to be sexually frustrated unfulfilled in her current marriage kate then visits a museum picks up a stranger they go back to his apartment for casual sex when done kate is set to leave but is attacked killed in the buildings elevator by a razor blade wielding blonde woman prostitute liz blake nancy allen discovers the gruesome scene sees the killer but manages to escape detective marino dennis franz says he suspects liz as being the killer as there are no other witnesses so liz teams up with kate s son peter keith gordon to track down the real killer clear liz s name see that justice is done written directed by brian de palma i thought dressed to kill was a good solid psychological murder mystery the script is measured slow at times but it likes to focus on the character s so you really know them the entire first twenty minutes is just developing kate as a character before she is suddenly killed off then the film switches it s attentions to liz no one else gets a look in this way dressed to kill is quite absorbing engaging unfortunately the character s themselves aren t exactly likable i found some of the dialogue quite funny at times especially the dirty talk that liz spouts occasionally the killers motives are somewhat plausible but i guess you d have to be pretty messed up to do anything suggested in dressed to kill it s a good film but it didn t excite me that much i didn t really find any character to root for or like the film tacks on a needless unnecessary twist ending that i didn t really see the point of director de palma directs with style visual flair from the art museum sequence to a car chase as a whole it s impeccably filmed throughout i d imagine that every shot in dressed to kill had a great deal of thought put into it i felt the film was a bit flat uninspired at times though nothing about it really excited me that much there is a fair bit of nudity some sex rape along with a few bits of gore violence kate s murder by razor blade in the elevator being the highlight if that s the right word however it s by no means as shocking or controversial when viewed today as many would have you believe with a supposed budget of about dressed to kill has that glossy high production value feel of a hollywood film the new york locations are nice the cinematography is good as a whole it s extremely well made i thought the music was inappropriate was far to loud intrusive the acting is ok but despite his top billing i didn t think caine had that much screen time allen was married to director de palma at the time dressed to kill was made interestingly out of the four films she appeared in made by de palma in two of them this blow out he cast her as a prostitute a body double was used for dickinson as she pleasures herself in a shower at the start dressed to kill is a good thriller that is well worth watching but i didn t think it quite lived up to it s lofty reputation good but not brilliant
even though there are no new episodes and it is rarely showed i used to love the magic of sabrina and the teenage witch i never got to see the last episodes but i do want to know what happened to miles or josh and why did the aunts have to disappear out of the show for good i m sure the ending went to be perfect but there are a lot of questions unanswered and i want to see the last episode of s t t w because i heard she decides between erin and harvey on her wedding day i really hope that she picks harvey and may i say nate richart is hott too bad hes too old for me though melissa joan hart has her own sense of cuteness that she adds to the show but there are many little stupid things for the show such as how famous bands come out of nowhere and play songs and all the cast is listening its kind of stupid plus the cat starts to really get lame as the show continued the jokes began just to get stupid and the things that the audio controlled audience would laugh at i would think it was so lame don t get me wrong at some parts it was funny but i think the show just kind of lost its magic so to speak as the show went on i give kudos to all the cast though for trying although that soleil moon frye girl had no taste and she was a horrid actress i wonder what melissa or any of the cast is doing now for that matter now that the show has ended
there seems to be only two types of reviews of this film on the net those who hate it and curse ralph bakshis name and those love it and call it work of genious i m inclined to be in the middle i am forced to agree with most of the criticisms of this film e g the cruel cutting of the story badly rotoscoped charecters over acting etc but dispite this i still love this film the rotoscoping when done properly adds an eerie lifelike dimension to the charecters and the final battle scene at the end of the film is fantastic the surrealistic scenes when the nineriders chase frodo are stylish and well executed and the musical score magic sadly the bad points outweight film but if you can bring yourself to ignore them it is a great film no doubt i ll be lynched by an angry mob of people who hate this film after writing this review ah well such is life
i liked this movie very much because it is a true story set in the amazon a part of the world that always has intrigued me i believe a condensed form of the book was published in reader s digest soon after the actual event occurred because i am a baby boomer the character and the actress are my contemporaries and for this reason i related to the film i also believe the movie is valuable for teaching survival skills if the viewer observes the character s following the streams that lead to the river and to the coastal settlements where she can get help as well as other survival techniques most important was her will to survive and to maintain a positive attitude in conclusion i hope viewers learn something from it in addition seeing it for entertainment i do wish the movie would be released in vhs and dvd soon as i should like to add it to my video collection it also should be shown more often on the satellite movie channels
not on the same level as ring or ring but still a good japanese horror flick nonetheless i wish north american horror producers would take a page out of the japanese horror template and put more spookiness and less cheap shocks in their flicks lots of good examples in this one scenes where a whited out face is scene staring behind a young actress photographs on a wall are suddenly glimpsed smiling just for a second and more worth checking out if you like the genre
unfortunately in cases such as these there are so many conflicting stories as everyone tries to cast blame on to others that it is a near impossibility to get a clear picture of what really happened this movie is a victim of such circumstances the writers too many of them have decided to take all of the stories and give them to the audience to let them decide which version of the truth they like the best as in the real life case there is no clear answer no conclusion and the audience is left with a general felling of being unfulfilled like coffee without the caffeine or sex without the climax whodunnits with no whodunnit are generally frustrating and makes you wonder why someone didn t do research before they put it out there at least tout your movie as a fiction if that is what it amounts to and this does that is not to say there are not some great performances here kilmer as holmes does an outstanding role bringing some humanity to what is otherwise an unsavory character kilmer and the real life lovers and friends who consulted on the film let the audience see a selfish troubled human being who though his faults were many and large was loved and cared for by many people except himself kudrow as holmes s wife only gives a glimmer of the dramatic actress she can be but it is very noticeable and unforgettable glimmer bosworth s character was not as emotionally complex as she could have been and needed to show more inner conflict to give credence to what ultimately happened between dawn and holmes she turned him in months after they fled to florida bosworth s apple cheeked performance is at time annoying at times touching but shows none of the backbone the real schiller must have possessed the other characters fade in to the woodwork which is a pity lucas is a great performer who could have sunk his teeth in to this role had it been fleshed out for him even dylan mcdermott was surprisingly capable in his role of drug dealing biker the fault of this movie does not lie with this cast but with the writing too many cooks spoil the soup and this kettle filled with so much promise ultimately leaves you hungry the story and characters may have been less than sympathetic but in what movie of this ilk are they not so other movies such as s drugstore cowboy starring matt dillon who was reportedly asked to take this role and refused worked with similar subject matter and mastered it to such a degree that you felt a kinship with the main character by the end of the movie despite what he had done van sandt could have given james cox and his crew a few lessons had someone bothered to try and find the truth this would have been an intriguing story as it is you will find the accompanying wadd documentary more palatable in the disc dvd and much more informative you will realize from the dvd that holmes was not a bad guy but not a very good one either as are most people
composed elegant carol marvelously played by the beautiful rebecca brooke her nice husband eddie likable david houseman carol s wacky constantly eating best gal pal anna delightfully essayed with infectious comic zeal by the adorable chris jordan and anna s hunky amorous husband pete a typically fine eric edwards are a quartet of liberated swingers who enjoy having frequent group sex with each other their usual routine gets disrupted when carol s lonely repressed but still alluring widow mother jennifer a superbly moving performance by the lovely jennifer welles drops by for a visit pretty soon jennifer loosens up and becomes a willing participant in the swingers blithely pleasurable and uninhibited carnal lifestyle with everyone except carol eager to seduce her writer director joe sarno concocts a sharp engrossing and perceptive examination of suburban angst and the limitations of the whole wild n easy s sexual revolution sarno turns traditional middle class mores on their heads and further spices things up with a bold and provocative mother daughter incest subplot moreover sarno elicits uniformly first rate acting from the bang up cast welles and brooke are both exceptional with excellent support from edwards jordan houseman arlana blue as flaky new age sex therapist shandara and erica eaton as saucy neighbor mrs fields better still all the women are extremely hot and enticing welles in particular seriously steams up the screen with her exquisitely voluptuous figure and smoldering erotic presence the sex scenes are really sizzling and fairly explicit but never raunchy or tedious stephen colwell s bright polished cinematography and jack justis bouncy melodic acoustic folk score are both on the money solid and effective recommended viewing for sarno fans
so i rented still crazy instead when i described hardcore logo to the guy at the video store he said that sounded kind of like still crazy so i rented it was i disappointed well yes as still crazy focuses on a classic rock band rather than a punk band but that s ok still crazy tells the story of the strange fruit a rock band that broke up in the s at the peak of their popularity at a large rock festival twenty years later the band members are all struggling to make a living and are offered the opportunity to play a concert at the twenty year anniversary of this festival they take up the offer and decide to reform on a permanent basis touring europe in the process some quite funny hijinks ensue and all the characters go through subtle changes watching this movie you feel more like a viewer of a carefully edited documentary than a participant and that s not bad at all
in anne of green gables marilla cuthbert helen westley and matthew cuthbert o p heggie middle aged siblings who live together at green gables a farm in avonlea on prince edward island decide to adopt a boy from distant orphanage to help on their farm but the orphan sent to them is a precocious girl of named anne shirley dawn evelyn paris a veteran of disney s series of alice shorts who later would adopt her character s name anne was only in lucy maude montgomery s source novel but the same actress could not credibly go from to college age during the course of the story the movie suffers somewhat from this concession as many of anne s reactions and much of what she says are more entertaining coming from an eleven year old that from a teenager as in the book anne is bright and quick eager to please but dissatisfied with her name her build her freckles and her long red hair being a child of imagination however anne takes much joy in life and adapts quickly to her new family and the environment of prince edward island in fact anne is the original teenage drama queen and the film s screenwriter elected to focus on this aspect of her character which transformed the basic genre from mildly amusing family drama to comedy a change that delighted audiences and that continues to frustrate reader purists since the comedy is very much in the spirit of the montgomery s story i can see no reason to take issue with the changes but let this serve as fair warning to anyone expecting a totally faithful adaptation the comedy element is the strength of the film as it is one of the earliest self reflexive parodies of hollywood conventions the actress anne shirley was one of hollywood s all time beauties and the film is in black and white so much of the amusement is in seeing the title character s endless laments about her appearance and hair color contradicted by what is appearing on the screen anne regularly regales her no nonsense rural companions with melodramatic lines like if you refuse it will be a lifelong sorrow to me perhaps the funniest moment is when she corrects the spelling of her name on the classroom blackboard tom brown does a nice job as anne s love interest gilbert blythe and sara haden steals all the scenes in which she appears as the cuthbert s pompous neighbor then again what do i know i m only a child

this is a very good spanish movie but i am worried that many out there will feel lost because many around the world have no idea what the spanish civil war was all about or when it was fought being a history teacher i had a big advantage but could easily see how the film could be confusing until you piece together all the pieces i doubt if this would be a big concern in spain where this film was made but for other audiences they may be a bit confused until later in the film the movie begins with year old carol and her mother returning to her mother s home town years have passed and you gather that they are coming to spain from new york city despite the strangeness carol speaks reasonably good spanish and much of the film is about how she adapts as for why her and her mother are alone i ll spill it now for those who don t pick up on the fact that carol s father is fighting in the war on the side of the republicans who eventually lost in this very bloody conflict the movie gets exceptional marks for its lovely camera work and music the rather slow and rambling pace isn t bad provided you are someone who can accept films this way i have seen several other spanish films about this war and this compares pretty well to them not better or worse just a decent slice of life film about those who are left behind as well as a nice coming of age flick ps if you don t know which side is which the republicans were mostly socialists and they were backed by the soviet union and mexico as well as volunteers from many countries including the usa the nationalists were led by franco and were aided by portugal and the fascist states of germany and italy
at the start this one is from england so of course i had chances that it will be intelligent and very good cinema i never heard of this film before from the minute i saw helena bonham carter i said to myself oh here s comes the feminine version of my left foot i was right but i was also wrong wrong because the two movies are very differents my left foot was a john ford alike movie and this one is a chaplin alike movie not because this is funny but chaplin at that great sense of melodrama that brings tears to your eyes i was right because in handsome daniel day lewis turn a little bit ugly by playing an crippled person and he did it with a great sense of reality here very beautiful bonham carter did exactly the same thing but with very feminine emotions the story is well written and it s very intelligent for me miss bonham carter gives one of the greatest woman s part of the s with emily lloyd in breaking the waves gee and look at her eyes she had the most beautiful eyes of cinema since jobyna ralston louise brooks michele morgan and ava gardner she s also a true talent as seen on many other movies see this one you won t regret it and a very fine job by branagh too
very few movies have had the impact on american culture the way urban cowboy has thank god it was temporary but uc is almost in a class by itself as one of those flicks that when you re flipping channels at am you just can t take your eyes off my top three are animal house and walking tall btw but that s beside the point i remember urban cowboy hit the theaters and overnite there were honkytonks being opened on every corner men were sporting cowboy hats with their penny loafers and if you didnt know how to two step you were considered a social moron personally i think it s a great movie travolta really surprised me on the heels of satnitefever who d a thunk he s actually believable too the soundtrack is awesome too bad charlene tilton of tv s dallas fame ruined johnny lee s career cause that guy was just terrific the show stealer here is scott glenn as the greaser ex con redneck cowboy and i ain t got nothing against greaser ex con cowboys semi being one myself but i ve always envied what i feel to be the greatest power line of all time pack at s t sort of like clint s make my day and watching him slap sissy around is the closest thing i ll see to my julia roberts fantasy so like i said beautiful

shirley maclaine in another tailor made role as the aunt to a single mom in a working class chicago neighborhood the veteran character actress gets another work out as a gutsy woman who won t let any set backs defeat her spirit of success the children a pre teen boy and girl are drawn to their spirited aunt zoe although the many magic tricks and practical jokes learned from her and applied at all the wrong opportunities eventually get them expelled from school the plot is cleverly enveloped in the cuban missile crisis with all of the social implications men building bomb shelters people watching news programs on what seemed to be the only tv set at a diner and a general mist of uneasiness and fear in the air when a harmless miracle is blown out of proportions the climactic conclusion nonetheless makes the viewer feel good yes virginia the sun will come up tomorrow clearly a small budget production this is still a sweet little film filled with the magic that sunday matinees were made of with a few choice oldies thrown into an effective sound track the whole family is sure to enjoy this one
jack lemmon and walter matthau began and ending their career together remember best as the grumpiest of old men as well as the oddest couple to have ever made us laugh lemmon and matthau were one of hollywood s best loved comedy teams of the last years not as raunchy as pryor and wilder instead they were the classic comedy team that reflected a more modern marx brothers routine such as the physical comedy as well as the mixed blend of chaos that marx chaplin and keaton were so famous for in the odd couple lemmon and matthau play complete opposites that create the chaos the physical comedy is as unique as chaplins the joke is usually on themselves as oppose to passing the joke onto another not your typical guy film it is in a way a coming of age comedy with two old men as oppose to two young teenagers in their prime the chemistry between lemmon and matthau is entertainment enough although this movie isn t for everyone this is a great comedy
i had the opportunity to see this film twice at the moving picture festival in birmingham alabama i enjoyed it so much that i watched it a second time when they had an encore screening when i think of the films that are shown at festivals i usually expect them to be edgy and offbeat often with the feel of an elaborate student project there s nothing wrong with these types of projects of course and i enjoy the unique styles of independent films but sometimes i want to see a more mainstream approach to independent film making by mainstream i mean more like a film produced for national release in other words a movie that you would see in a regular movie theater the writing directing cinematography casting and acting in this movie are all totally pro there is nothing typically independent about this film as an aspiring director i am always looking for movies that will motivate me to stop procrastinating and push harder to get my career going this is one of those films as i watched the big bad swim my motivation level was incredible i felt like my adrenaline had kicked in the reason i felt this way was because i was so impressed with every aspect of this production i left the theater excited and ready to start writing that long put off project when a movie makes me feel like that i know it s really good this is the first feature length project from ishai setton and i found myself wishing that it had been my project for me that s really rare see this film it s beautifully shot and directed and the casting is excellent paget brewster delivers a very believable and likable performance she has a quality about her a charisma that really draws you in and keeps you focused on her any time she is on screen she makes you feel like you know her personally as a friend that s a gift i think the industry is really missing out by not utilizing her acting abilities more often jeff branson and jess weixler also did top notch jobs i can not say enough nice things about the big bad swim i look forward to future projects from all of those involved in its production
somewhat funny and well paced action thriller that has jamie foxx as a hapless fast talking hoodlum who is chosen by an overly demanding u s treasury agent david morse to be released on the streets of new york to find a picky computer thief hacker doug hutchinson who stole forty two million dollars from the treasury and left two guards shot dead bait marks the sophomore feature for antoine fuqua the replacement killers and he handles the task fairly well even though it doesn t top his first movie what the two films have in common is the action sequences which are flat out excellent foxx is pretty good here although his character is annoying in the beginning but throughout the film i began to catch on hutchinson is marvelous as the mastermind who can be ruthless as john malkovich and patient as the late laurence olivier was in marathon man morse is okay as the agent who comes up with the ingenious plan to get whoever did it at all cost
hollywood north is a satirical look at the time in canadian film history when the canadian government offered huge tax breaks for films made in canada most of the time it was treated as a tax shelter or a cheap way to get american films made for example porky s came out of it anyways matthew modine plays a novice producer who wants to make an adaptation of a beloved canadian novel however in order to get the money he needs a american name star he gets a loose cannon and learns he has to compromise to the point where the film no longer resembles the book it was originally based on it plays well in canada but may not be understood outside of the great white north americans will think we re satirizing ourselves but will miss the point that we re actually satirizing them for canadians for the rest of the world
brown of harvard is a hard movie to pin down we expect a lot more from our movies these days so it helps to remember that audiences in the s were a bit more innocent william haines is charming as the rogue who has to stumble through pain and humiliation to find success and even glory all of the relationships in the movie feel very stilted except for the homoerotic tie between billy and jack pickford the town nerd the movie has everything romance tears love death and even sports it s a great education in how society has changed in the th century
not sure one can call this an anti war film it shows war at an elite level these are elite troops that know what they are doing and take great pride in it even when they are pacifist they still enjoy the skill level and defeating their foes even if it does go against being a pacifist the movies is slow and rather uneventful and in many ways is rather tame as war movies go more so by todays standards no body parts flying off as in modern movies it is brutal in other ways though as you see killing at a personal level this is more of a thinking man s movie once you start to watch you don t want to miss anything the thoughts of the men in the movie and their interactions is what the movie is about not the combat itself or a big exciting storyline this maybe called a war triller if you are into the skill of war if you are into reading or seeing programs about the sas and so on you want to watch this movie comparable movies are the hill with sean connery th parallel with an all star cast the naked and the dead with cliff robertson all are unusual in their way and show war at a personal level enjoy
actually one particular person character isn t right there but my summary line is referring to the power of the movie and this is all achieved without any fancy camera moves and or big production sets but with a great story and very believable and good actors conveying the story arc you could call it a companion piece to great japan movies cinema such as tokyo story etc not so much story wise of course but more mood wise great acting nuances in the performances that are truly gems if you re eager to experience a touching story and want to see a movie touching you emotionally than this is the one to go as you have noticed as with many of my reviews i m not getting into the story there are places here at imdb where you can look those up i m not one to spoiler the story whatsoever
three girls the youngest descendents of the gaylord family one of america s most royal families are orphaned at a young age right before he goes off to france to fight in wwi their father tells the oldest fiona never to sell the land by the time the sisters have become adults they have had to squander most of their money to pay for lawyers to defend their property through certain loopholes in the father s will a man named charles barclay stands to gain possession of the gaylord land on which he wants to build a complex called barclay circle barclay is actually based on john d rockefeller who was buying up land and buildings from affluent families in new york so he could build rockefeller center this film deals mostly with the melodramatic concerns of the three sisters fiona well played by barbara stanwyck although it s certainly not to be counted as one of her best roles seems like a cold domineering woman and it becomes clear that she has some skeletons in her closet susanna played by nancy coleman is a little ditsy and completely in love with a young modern artist named gig young coleman s was my favorite performance in the film evelyn played by geraldine fitzgerald is a rather pretentious seductress with a monocle who married into noble blood in england but that doesn t stop her from trying to steal gig from her sister the three sisters are developed quite well but as is the major trend in the gay sisters never well enough charles barclay is played by george brent he isn t very good well he would be satisfactory if the story had played out the way it should have but he always seems like a scumbag in the film when we re asked to sympathize with him late in the film it s impossible gig young is played by huh gig young no he s not playing himself what happened is that the actor who had acted in several movies previously under his real name byron barr was pressured by warner brothers to change his name to something more catchy i m not sure who made the final choice but he eventually changed his screen name to gig young after the character whom he plays in the gay sisters weird eh young is quite good through most of the film but the script does some unfortunate things with his character late in the film which ultimately harm the audience s sympathy for him in two other supporting roles helen thimig and gene lockhart are quite good the gay sisters had great potential to turn out to be one of the great cinematic family sagas the characters are all interesting as are their situations unfortunately the script never strives for anything more than the simplest melodrama if it had made the interrelationships of all the major characters more complex fleshed out for example the rivalry between evelyn and susanna or made the flashback more intricate the film could have been fantastic it also could have fleshed out the prologue more let us know more about the gaylord family we need to care more about the characters and we need to sympathize with them more and the ending needed some major fixing it basically just gives up at the end fiona s problems are solved so poorly that it hurts whatever sympathy her character had gained as the film progressed falls apart it s also far too happy this story seems moving towards tragedy or maybe just a sense of historical significance or loss and we still hate barclay and the conflict between the two sisters and gig is never solved as bad as fiona s story ends susanna s gig s and evelyn s is even worse i still liked the film it s thoroughly watchable even if it doesn t involve us like other great films of the era mostly for its potential it should have been remade or the novel should have been re adapted at some point during the studio era it is too dated to be remade now the s would have been the best time during the time of films like giant
full house was and still is a great show it s a good show for people of all ages and is also a good family show there really aren t any shows like it anymore the kids are very cute and even though it s a bit cheesy it s still good especially for anyone who watched it when they were a kid i would love to see the cast interviewed now anyone that would like to see interviews of the cast kind of like a where are they now type thing for the special features of the dvd should go to the petition spot website and sign a petition titled full house reunion on dvd as there is a petition for this in hopes that the cast may want to do it yay for full house
this remarkable film can be summed up very easily first of all while the comparisons to princess bride are inevitable it s almost futile to do so while both films combine adult wit and humor with a fairy tale backdrop stardust is so much different than any other fantasy sci fi film i ve ever seen it s such a hybrid of those genres but its plot and script are so unique that along with the performances special effects cinematography and score the finished product is simply not all that comparable to anything that has ever appeared on the silver screen secondly the score is very effective at simultaneously pulling us into the story and the fantasy world in which it takes place and pushing the story along while creating just the right amount of awe and excitement necessary to make the magic believable within the realm where the characters exist thirdly i did not find the film to be even remotely difficult to follow or confusing in any way in fact the interesting interplay between the three main subplots actually made it even that much more compelling to watch wonderfully casted and superbly acted across the board this fantasy adventure with sci fi elements was the best one i ve seen since return of the king not that i am comparing the two at all ok so its not that easy to sum up but don t let any crude and or heartless and cynical review nor the film s pathetic pr prevent you from partaking in the best time you could have at the movies this summer or even possibly in a long time
although i can understand the bad things someone has to say about this movie i still found it to be absolutely amazing it will touch you and unless your a critic searching deep into the flaws and mishaps of every movie or you just simply aren t touched by anything it is worth seeing don t come into the movie expecting anything just have a box of tissues and an open mind it is beautiful and the acting is brilliant i think will smith despite that he s yet again playing another lonely depressed individual is amazing i believe a good actor is someone who can truly portray feelings and emotions we all have at our worst best experiences in such a way that it reaches out to you and makes you feel something and that s exactly what this movie does give it a chance
this has to be one of the most beautiful moving thought provoking films around it s good family entertainment and at the same time makes you think very hard about the issues involved every time i see the ghost of zac riding the bike through the puddle at the end i can t help but cry my eyes out john thaw s performance is so touching and it is a shame he is no longer with us gone but not forgotten a outstanding film full marks
as a low budget enterprise in which the filmmakers themselves are manufacturing and distributing the dvds themselves we perhaps shouldn t expect too much from broken in disc form and yet what s most remarkable about this whole achievement is the fact that this release comes with enough extras to shame a james cameron dvd and a decidedly fine presentation with regards to the latter the only major flaw is that broken comes with a non anamorphic transfer otherwise we get the film in its original ratio demonstrating no technical flaws and looking pretty much as should be expected indeed given ferrari s hands on approach in putting this disc together you can pretty much guarantee such a fact the same is also true of the soundtrack here we are offered both dd and dd mixes and whilst i m uncertain as to which should be deemed the original the fact that ferrari had an involvement in both means neither should be considered as inferior indeed though the dd may offer a more atmosphere viewing experience owing to the manner in which it utilises the score both are equally fine and free of technical flaws as for extras the disc is positively overwhelmed by them take a look at the sidebar on the right of the screen and you ll notice numerous commentaries loads of featurettes and various galleries indeed given the manner in which everything has been broken down into minute chunks rather than compiled into a lengthy documentary there really is little to discuss the anatomy of a stunt featurette for example is exactly what it claims to be and the same goes for the rest of pieces as such we get coverage on pretty much ever aspect of broken s pre production production and post production and whilst it may have been preferable to find them in a more easily digestible overall making of in this manner we do get easy access to whatever special feature we may wish to view of the various pieces then it is perhaps only the commentaries which need any kind of discussion then again there s also a predictable air to each of the chat tracks the one involving the actors is overly jokey and doesn t take the film too seriously ferrari s pieces are incredibly enthusiastic about the whole thing and the technical ones are well extremely technical of course we also get some crossover with what s been covered elsewhere on the discs but at only minutes none of these pieces outstay their welcome indeed all in all a fine extras package
one round jack sander is called that because he s a carnival boxer who fights any man in the audience if they can last one round they win a prize a popular way to draw customers into traveling shows long ago jack is in love with the ticket girl mabel though her head is quickly turned when bob corby enters the ring to try his chances with jack what no one at the fight knows is that bob is the champ so he s able to beat jack though it takes him some work as a result bob asks jack to become his sparring partner and give up the carnival circuit later jack improves so much that he too becomes a legitimate boxer slowly he works his way up the rankings until he s nearly ready to take on the champ in the meantime the champ and mabel start running around behind jack s back even though by now mabel has married jack so when the final fight occurs between jack and bob it s very personal and jack is ready to kill him is he good enough will rise justifiable rage against bob help or hinder his performance tune in and see this film was directed by alfred hitchcock and while today this sort of film seems strange for a director known for mystery suspense films back in the s hitchcock had no fixed genre which he directed or wrote he did both for this film in fact in many ways this film is more indicative of hitchcock s silent style as a somewhat similar plot came up in one of his next silents the manxman also starring carl brisson as the wronged husband so while this seems a lot like a standard boxing film of the day it was not a radical departure for this great director even with its rather formulaic ending overall while a bit predictable and having ian hunter playing a boxing champ seems silly the film works well while far from a perfect silent it s well worth seeing and packs a nice punch
i remember this show from swedish television i was only years of age and it scared me beyond belief i would love to revisit this series and see if it was just as excellent as remember though i suspect my taste and demands have changed although this was released before alien and a plethora of other space thrillers i suspect that it has its root in scary movies from the s and the political climate of the s when i think of it this was a real sci fi a movie trying to discuss scientific and political questions about who we are and what we are the term sci fi has since then become bleak and come to be the term for any movie that has space ships in them
let s get some things straight first zombies don t exist so the filmmaker can have them walk run hell even fly if he wants to that s what makes this original zombie movie so good everything they did was so damn original i hate it when filmmakers do everything like romero or when fan boys expect everything like romero some idiots think that zombies should only growl like a typical romero movie once again zombies don t exist so a filmmaker can make zombies whistle if he wants the zombies in this movie all look very good but obviously they are not decaying corpses since they just freaking died they are pretty messed up though and full of chopped faces and blood one of the coolest scenes was a half eaten cat it looked so damn real my daughter cried when she saw it this movie got really good reviews in fangoria and rue morgue so that made me want to go see it i m glad i listened they are always right when it comes to real horror fan s tastes out of go rent it
harem suare is the best film i saw in the year bravo ferzan ozpetek sensually shot and stunningly portrayed harem suare is a bold film that tackles interracial romance which is such a taboo in hollywood women of all shapes sizes and color populate the film cut off from the outside world the women entertain each other by telling stories about intrigue rivalry and jealousies within their ranks
page is one of those films madhur bhandarkar makes to expose societal filth the film is compelling but like most of bhandarkar s films it is one sided and overly pessimistic this film is all about tabloid journalism gossip celebrities the film exposes the lives of socialites whose lifestyle is disastrously boastful peculiar and repulsive they party they care for nothing but fame they plan parties at funerals they are craving for more money and a higher reputation they will do anything to get due exposure in the media to get their names boldly printed on the daily newspaper s social column known as page with huge photographs which will be the center of people s discussions they are attention seeking salacious and hypocrite the film industry is shown as sleazy with casting couch being a common phenomenon among filmmakers that s where our lovely heroine a young social column reporter madhvi sharma is thrown all these people from mumbai s elite depend on her articles and she is the right person to befriend at these parties if you want her to mention you in her article later in the film we learn that even those who are madhvi s friends are no different from these high society people this was tough viewing for me although the film is unquestionably brave and the issues it deals with are interesting the film s music is average the only passable songs are kitne ajeeb and huzoor e ala sung by the two melody queens lata mangeshkar and asha bhosle respectively otherwise the soundtrack is bad one song which was particularly horrendous is filmy very filmy the film s writing is quite good the second half is far better than the first as it turns more matter of fact and exposes much more important issues such as terrorism and child abuse that s where the film has to be applauded it was sad to know that people prefer to ignore such crimes out of fear and konkona sen sharma s character s disappointment was very easy to relate to she was excellent throughout the film and her acting in the last few scenes was particularly impressive atul kulkarni s part was very small but he did full justice to it boman irani is solid as the newspaper s editor sandhya mridul is lovable as madhvi s sassy roommate pearl who marries an older man for money and is honest enough to admit it the film s ending is really well done and provides a certain sigh of relief after the unimaginably tough proceedings page is a good film it is interesting and at times moving but the level of its interest and its general quality are marred by its exaggerated overly messy and negative portrayal of the rich and famous
well it definitely is unlike anything else directed by lynch no supernatural stuff no violence no profanity nevertheless it is a beautiful flick it s a little slow but perhaps that was intentional because it s the story of an old man s week that s my best guess for its duration journey the characters are everyday people and thus they are believable the performances are good and the final scene was incredibly touching everyone who has a sibling can relate to it lyle and alvin don t even have to say anything for a moment they are back in the old days and all the fighting is forgotten
i think this film has much to recommend it particularly an especially sinister performance by david morse and a more than passable performance by the always worth watching mr foxx although there are a lot of holes in the plot and the motivation is very very hard to follow in some cases all in all it makes for a nice time in front of the tube
chase has created a true phenomenon with the sopranos unfaltering performances rock solid writing and some great music make up what has become quite possibly the best show ever all of the cast are strong but falco and gandolfini earned every inch of those emmy s anyone who doubts this need only sample a few episodes particularly from the first few seasons james gandolfini is absolutely fierce absolutely terrifying and you still find yourself loving him mesmerized by him many people that i ve spoken to about the sopranos who haven t seen it yet will say i m just not a fan of mafia movies shows whatever run don t walk and get it those same people usually love e r but i bet they don t much care for hospitals it s not about the context
i watched this last night on tv hbo i have to admit that the tension in this movie was unsurpassed by most other fn era movies i loved the way chip would be all calm one moment and then violent the very next moment it was classic ahh yes the dames the villians the cigars and thuggish cops it has it all this movie delivered all the goods to me i especially loved the way they mixed communism into the plot very common for this era of movie very daring also since blacklisting was popular in those days i rate this movie one of the best i have seen in the fn genre
the plot had some wretched unbelievable twists however the chemistry between mel brooks and leslie ann warren was excellent the insight that she comes to there are just moments provides a philosophical handle by which anyone could pick up and embrace life that was one of several moments that were wonderfully memorable
hi im scott a k a woody i love the film twisted desire and i love watching melissa joan hart on the t v as i think she is fine i am a real fan of sabrina the teenage witch too so this helped my watch it don t ask i love the way that nicole plans out her parents murder very carfully as she makes sure that someone else pulls the trigger and practices on the bottles so she wont give away her fingerprints a very well planned out idea back i guess it all backfired on nicole as she got caught as her old boyfriend comes along and puts a hidden camera under his shirt i give this film a nine out of ten and put it in my top films list and last but not least if anyone see s this film in the shops please tell me as i seen it on tv and didn t record it bye
i wasn t aware of steve mcqueen in i only knew that i was extremely frightened about going to see this film i d been devastated by the movie trantula at age seven but i was ten now the st scene where the blob crawls up the farmer s probing stick and engulfs his hand was enough to make me want to leave the theater but i stayed and suffered through each of our monster s attacks i felt such horror when steve and his girl barely made it out of the doctor s office poor doc and even more when the blob entered a movie theater and devoured a large portion of the audience so many in fact that it oooooozzzzzzed out of the front doors too huge now to fit through just one it seemed indestructible and unlimited in growth potential and when it trapped poor steve in a sieve like diner he seemed like a sure dinner to be to say that the blob was cold would be a modern day description but in the end better icy than scaring and mentally rupturing little kids i remember walking home that evening with my uncle nick trying to act brave he knew i was in trouble and when i got into bed that night i could not only feel the blob in the room but when i summoned up the courage to look down at the floor there the red pulsating heart like hungry dude sat waiting for me to try and get up and go to the bathroom it took months to recover i m years old now i ve made it of course the blob wasn t destroyed
remember ralph bakshi the guy that was an animator on terrytoons then on paramount cartoon studios after that he was a director on fritz the cat and heavy traffic well this is coonskin and it s actually pretty good racist but good the movie takes place in harlem nights no duh it was a working title but with a twist that becomes a lampoon of a disney movie song of the south it s about sampson barry white and the preacherman charles gordone rush to help their friend randy philip michael thomas escape from prison but are stopped by a roadblock and wind up in a shootout with the police while waiting for them randy unwillingly listens to fellow escapee pappy scatman crothers as he begins to tell randy a story about three guys i used to know just like you and your friends pappy s story is told in animation set against live action background photos and footage brother rabbit voice of thomas brother bear voice of white and preacher fox voice of gordone decide to pack up and leave their southern settings after the bank mortgages their home and sells it to a man who turns it into a brothel arriving in harlem rabbit bear and fox find that it isn t all that it s made out to be they encounter a con man named simple savior a phony revolutionary leader who purports to be the cousin of black jesus and that he gives his followers the strength to kill whites in a flashy stage performance in his church savior acts out being brutalized by symbols of black oppression represented by images of john wayne elvis presley and richard nixon before asking his parishioners for donations rabbit first goes up against madigan a virulently racist and homophobic white police officer and the bag man for the mafia who demonstrates his contempt for african americans in various ways including a refusal to bathe before an anticipated encounter with them he believes they re not worth it when madigan finds out that rabbit has been taking his payoffs he and his cohorts ruby and bobby are led to a nightclub called the cottontail a black stripper distracts him while an lsd sugar cube is dropped into his drink madigan while under the influence of his spiked drink is then maneuvered into a sexual liaison with a stereotypically effeminate gay man and then shoved into clothes that women were representative of the racist archetype adorned in something racist and finally shoved out the back of the club where he discovers that ruby and bobby are dead then while recovering from his delirium of being drugged shoots his gun around randomly and is shot to death by the police after shooting one of them rabbit bear fox and the opponent boxer rush out of the boxing arena as it blows up the live action story ends with randy and pappy escaping while being shot at by various white cops but managing to make it out alive this movie was controversial at that time of release and was re edited by the director several times under the title street fight which is obvious since street fight is a documentary about racism in the streets in fact this movie has the same subject as the documentary that caused bryanston pictures the distributor of this film and the original tobe hopper classic texas chainsaw massacre to go out of business because paramount wanted to produce and distribute this film but due to racism bryanston took over bakshi s production despite the controversy it was worth the entertainment the animation was awesome at that time the plot makes sense and it s actually funny too final verdict
home room really surprised me in comparison to other movies that were written regarding columbine high school this one is the best home room does not show the school shooting but rather the aftermath and the effects of the community and the town the movie focus on two opposite characters alecia busy phillips and deanna erika christensen alecia is an outcast who witnessed the entire shooting she seems to show no emotion about it deanna is a popular girl and the only surviving victim alecia is forced to visit deanna at the hospital in order to graduate meanwhile the police are investigating alecia as she might have known the shooting was going to happen alecia and deanna are very different and do not get along at first eventually they develop a mutual understanding for one another and become friends very much in the style of the breakfast club home room beautifully shows the power of closeness and turmoil after a school shooting i would recommend this film to anyone and everyone
i really enjoyed this film all aspects of the film were top notch including the most important for me anyway the screenplay and the acting this is definitely one of richard widmark s strongest roles he is totally convincing in his performance just out of curiosity imagine how humphrey bogart or robert mitchum might have tackled this role this is my first exposure to jean peter s work that i can remember she impressed so much here that i will definitely be on the lookout for her other work thelma ritter in an unglamourous role deserved the oscar nomination she received for playing the informant this film works on every level the black and white photography is perfectly appropriate and the story hooks the viewer right from the beginning widmark and peters have great chemistry in their difficult romance strongly recommended
big splashy film of the broadway music nathan frank sinatra loves to roll the dice and organize illegal crap games blonde loving adelaide vivian blaine wants to marry him if he gives up craps he decides on one last game when sky masterson marlon brando who bets big is in town he bets sky that he can t get mission worker sarah brown jean simmons to go with him to havana that may sound like a strange plot summary but so is the movie this is a real mixed bag there s some wonderful stuff here the songs are all good and the dancing is incredible the real show stopper is at the crap game at the end also brando is really quite good here it might seem strange to think of him singing and dancing but he pulls it off i have to admit seeing big bulky brando pulling off some difficult dance moves was a lot of fun also sinatra is pretty good and blaine is just wonderful as his long suffering girlfriend her song and dance numbers are definite highlights here now for the bad parts jean simmons is a wonderful actress but she s stuck with a drab colorless role and can t do much with it the movie is far too long at minutes the scenes between brando and simmons really drag and should have been shortened also most of the characters speak in very precise english contractions are never used maybe it s trying to be amusing coming out of the mouths of gangsters but i found it jarring and it kept throwing me out of the movie it s worth catching for the songs and dances but the over length of it does get to you after a while i give it a
the usual cat and mouse antics abound until jerry jumps into a bottle of invisible ink he gets the bright idea of torturing tom without him knowing the cat gets wise and tries to do stuff to make him see jerry even if it s not fool proof of course jerry gets butch aka killer aka spike the dog into the act even if it s late in the short and his contribution is minimal indeed brilliant animated short which kind of reminded me of the one with the white mouse who scares tom so badly most of the gags work and all violent as any good tom and jerry short should truly be this hilarious cartoon can be found on disc one of the spotlight collection dvd of tom jerry my grade b
found this flick in a videostore it cost to buy the whole movie stinks really bad the so called colonel who would the hero here if the cover could have been trusted must be in his eighties and is barely able to walk he nevertheless manages to shoot some of the dumbest ninjas in the world then the story leaves the colonel which makes sense given the old man s inability to do anything worth mentioning a now two terrifyingly eighties looking guys take over in what must have been some sort of story i got lost a hundred times but didn t mind because the movie is so bad it s real fun to watch zero budget trash with actors not deserving that name go check it out
i was when i first saw the movie and it has always been a huge favorite of mine of course you can t deny the appeal of kristofferson in the movie how fine is that man sheesh he still is he s the bad boy every woman secretly wants his acting is flawless he played a drunk druggie only the way someone who really had gone through it could and he had in he finally got on the wagon so it was all very real the music is great and even though in later years i thought streisand was somewhat not the right person for him in a physical beauty sense i think it s more a problem for male viewers than female us gals are just looking at kris and naturally the guys are looking at the female interest my husband cannot watch the movie b c of her he doesn t like her looks but i did make him sit through just the red ferrari scene on the road towards the end just so he could see how well done it was the camera work was so perfect and you were totally in the car with him with the music blasting you should have seen it on my plasma wow and lastly the transfer quality was great anamorphic widescreen and really clear with great color and very low noise except for dark areas which is normal for all film brought back some great memories of my mom and i loving this movie together i bought a copy for her for christmas would have loved to watch it together with her last night i have tried to sit through the original with judy garland but i guess seeing this one first i just can t get into the earlier era watching all the concert footage in the version was so much like what i was living at the time i am working my way through the commentary by streisand but she seems to only talk about herself and the songs so far she has barely even mentioned kris or details about scenes in the movie her voice sounds exactly the same now as then check it out if you grew up in the same era as me born in you will love it wendy
i have seen this film several times and watched it today on tcm solely because of geraldine fitzgerald she is a much underrated actress and i have to admit i have had a crush on her since i first saw her probably in wuthering heights or more years ago the real star in this movie however is paul lukas and he deserved all the accolades he got he makes it clear whether we like it or not that the end justifies the means naziism had to be stopped and anything that helped do it was good he gave his children a line about being bad and that they should not be bad but as he said earlier when conversing with adults he would do this sort of thing again without hesitation lukas did give an excellent portrayal of a man caught in this situation and made it clear that what he did was a very hard thing to do some people think his victim was a nazi but i don t think so i think he was only after the money his nazi associates knew this and that is why they did not have much use for him one interesting point in the film and presumably also in the play is the fact that muller lucas is a german while the anti german hysteria of wwi was not repeated in wwii there was considerable anti german sentiment and some germans were interred similar to what happened in california with people of japanese ancestry it was something of an act of bravery for hellman to write a play about good germans at this time maybe she thought they were the ones who signed the nazi soviet pact after all the us and british air forces were bombing german cities and having no qualms about killing innocent civilians i think however that the dresden bombing and firestorm happened later after watch on the rhine was released the title is something of a play on words as the watch is looking west from germany in fact watch am rhein was a german army marching song used in wwii but the nazis had their own marching song that was used as well but muller is a german and he is engaged in his own wach am rhein all the other actors did an excellent job here although bodo was too much there are children like him i am surprised he did not give his father s secret away in real life he may very well have done so
my brother brought this movie home from the rental store and i remember expecting it to be such a bore i think the title especially put me off i can t ever remember starting a movie with such low expectations and being so completely won over i watched the movie twice before i let my brother take it back to the store it is very infrequent that a movie speaks to me the way this one did i was completely caught up in ruby s situation as she tries to make her way through her life the bad thing about this movie is that it seems to end so quickly i could have kept watching for hours another downside is that i have been unsatisfied with everything ashley judd has done since she is so perfect in this movie this film is easily in my top ten favorites of all time
of all the movies i have seen and that s most of them this is by far the best one made that is primarily about the u s naval airships blimps during the ww ii era yes there are other good lta related movies but most use special effects more than any real time shots this man s navy has considerably more real time footage of blimps etc true lots of corny dialog but that s what makes more interesting hollywood movies even today p s i spent years out of and have over hours in navy airships of all types from through proud member of the naval airship association etc atc la ac usn retired
when i first heard about the show i heard a lot about it and it was getting some good reviews i watched the first episode of this forensic fairy tale as it so proclaims itself and i really got hooked on it i have loved it since this show has a good sense of humour and it s fun to see a good show like this the cast is excellent as their characters and i wouldn t want to change them in any way for those unfamiliar with this show pushing daisies centers around a man named ned aka the pie maker played by lee pace who discovered a special gift when he was a boy he could bring the dead back to life with the touch of a finger he first did so with his dog digby however there is the catch if he keeps a dead person alive for more than one minute someone else dies he learned this when he brought his mother back to life and his childhood crush s father died in ned s mother s place the other catch is if he touches the person again they re dead again but this time for good he learned this when his mother kissed him goodnight his father took him to boarding school and when he left ned never saw his father again almost years later ned owns a pie bakery cleverly titled the pie hole a co worker of ned s olive snook kristin chenoweth has a crush on ned but ned rejects her moves trying not to get close to anyone learning from past experiences private investigator emerson cod chi mcbride discovered the gift that ned has and decides to make him a partner in solving murders ned touches the victim asks who killed them and when the minute is up he touches them again and they solve it that s how they usually solve it throughout the episodes the murders have very interesting plots and be what people least expect one day ned discovers that his next murder to solve is his childhood sweetheart charlotte chuck charles anna friel he brings her back to life and decides to break the rules and keep her alive in her place the funeral director who stole jewelery from the corpses died when emerson finds out and when chuck wants to help with solving the murders he doesn t agree a bit for a while we hear him call chuck dead girl this is all kept in secret from olive chuck s aunts vivian and lily ellen greene and swoosie kurtz respectively and everyone else for that matter in case anyone recognized her from obituaries the news etc vivian and lily formerly synchronized swimmers hadn t left the house in years emerson ned and chuck agree to work together ned and chuck grow to love each other though they can t touch each other ever again this show is funny has terrific characters contains great plot twists and will definitely get your spirits up i hope it doesn t get cancelled at episodes
i ve seen the blob several times and is one of the better low budget alien invasion movies from the s a strange meteor lands just outside a small town and an elderly man goes to investigate this a strange jelly like substance then attaches itself to one of his arms and a young couple who saw the meteor land arrive in time and take him to the local doctor s where the old man then gets completely absorbed by the mass the doctor and his nurse are the next victims and the mass is getting bigger when these incidents are reported to the police they don t believe the young couple and accuse them of making all this up they finally believe them when the mass now huge turns up in the town s cinema and everybody runs into the streets screaming it then attaches itself on a diner with the young couple and some others inside the blob is stopped by spraying a load of fire extinguishers at it and it freezes which is its weakness it is then transported by plane to the frozen wastes of the arctic and disposed of there but it is only frozen not dead this movie has a typical setting for its period teenagers and a small town the blob has a good rock and roll style theme song at the beginning and the movie is atmospheric throughout the sequel beware the blob followed in and a remake came in but this is the best of the blob movies the cast is lead by steve mcqueen the great escape and is the movie that made him a star and aneta corsaut plays his girlfriend i m not familiar with any of the other stars the blob is a must see for all sci fi fans fantastic rating stars out of
this is an incredible film i can t remember the last time i saw a swedish movie this layered it s funny it s tragic it s compelling and most of all it s a slice of swedish small town life it crushes the clich s and dwells deeper it makes you feel connected not only to the main characters but to all the characters big city girl tracing back to her roots her small hometown to celebrate her father s th birthday crossing paths with people she hasn t met in several years although the story itself isn t unique it offers a fresh approach the center of the story is the relationship between three sisters on different stages in life who aren t very close or at least don t realize how close they are one key reason that makes it so easy to connect to the people in this film is the immaculate cast first i m more than pleased about the fact that there are absolutely no so called a list swedish actors in this film usually there is a handful of actors that has the ability to find their way into almost every major production in sweden this time the production company managed to keep it real by casting actors who actually seem to love their profession sofia helin is probably the first swedish actress since eva r se to prove that you don t need words to convey an emotion the writing is also very appealing the dialogue is more than believable and compared with other swedish films from the past year or two it s ahead by miles maria blom controls everything from the beginning and if you didn t know you would never guess that this is her first time writing and directing a feature length film i can t wait for her next one once you start watching this you really want to see it through
i just finished viewing this finely conceived and beautifully acted directed movie it was nip and tuck as to whether i was going to waste my time viewing a movie on the lifetime movie network because of the horribly distracting commercials reading the earlier comments persuaded me to give it a shot after all the worst that could happen would be that i might fall asleep during one of the boring yet lengthy bug spray ads so why did i watch it mainly because when imdb gives a movie a weighted average of who s statistical average was it must be a sure hit i was totally delighted to have taken the time to view this movie commercial pox and all helen hunt continues to amaze me with her ability to take on tough roles adapting her core persona to fit each role the portrait she painted in this film of the tough yet perceptively human police officer was beautifully executed when the scene calls for quick witted timely delivered verbal intercourse she can stand toe to toe with any actor yet she is adept at the delivery of volumes of emotional response without uttering a word relying only on facial expression and body language without the commercials which by design kill the continuity of any good film this would have been a real edge of the seat nail biter i gave it a

as did others in this forum when fobidden planet was offered in i rushed to see it this story is an interesting phenomenon i suggest because young old male female sci fi experts and people who find such fare way out all can follow and enjoy this film s story and plot lines very well this is the first movie set on a planet other than earth in the th century other than serials such as flash gordon leslie nielsen was vocally a bit weak for his role at that time but walter pigeon marvin miller anne francis richard anderson earl holliman and especially warren stevens all acquitted themselves very well there are so many visual splendors in this one it s hard to choose a favorite from the film s scenes the approach to altair the starship itself the landing on the planet s alien surface the descent via extensor stairs the first view of the landscape the approach of the rocket sled dr morbius s house seen from without and from within the underground complex and its wonders the setup of the weaponry the battle with the monster the final approach of the unseen destroyer the escape from the doomed planet all these scenes are etched into the viewer s mind because we discover them along with the participants veteran cyril hume s literate script was filmed intelligently by long time director fred mcleod wilcox with clarity and imagination it is a shock to realize there s no music at all the film is carried by the words the actors and the mystery revelation storyline it can be watched again and again with pleasure i have been doing so for nearly fifty years until this famous and well loved film was created no film had tried to imagine a world beyond earth and for decades afterward ships kept crashing back on the planet as if the writers imaginations were failing and causing the crashes still the best many say that says something negative about this nation s so called intellectual leaders imaginations and something very positive indeed i suggest about those who made this gem
how many of us wish that we could throw away social and cultural obligations and be free most of us i suspect shall we dance is not a movie about dancing it is about learning about ourselves recognising what we are looking for in life and having the courage to go in search of it mr sugiyama is a middle aged member of a japanese society where ballroom dancing is viewed as unsuitable behaviour one day mr sugiyama sees a beautiful girl leaning out of the window of a dancing acadamy he is fascinated by her and eventually signs up for dancing lessons he is ashamed of his dancing and afraid of ridicule he hides the fact that he is attending dancing classes from his colleagues and family there is a hilarious scene in the mensroom at the office when sugiyama and watanabe a workmate who also dances are interrupted practising some dance steps there are many other funny and warm hearted scenes the ending is not a fairytale but it leaves the viewer feeling good this movie helped me to understand the japanese people a little better it is a warm and very worthwhile film to see
this film and it s sequel barry mckenzie holds his own are the two greatest comedies to ever be produced a great story a young aussie bloke travels to england to claim his inheritance and meets up with his mates who are just as loveable and innocent as he is it s chock a block full of great sayings where else could you find someone who needs a drink so bad that he s as dry as a dead dingoes donger great characters top acting and it s got great sheilas and more fosters consumption then any other three films put together top notch and some of the funniest songs you ll ever hear and it s full of great celebrities definitely my two favourite films of all time i watch them at least once a fortnight
la maman et la putain has to be watched as a movie that is both related to the time it was released post and eternal in many respects true the actors don t act true they talk a lot but what they talk about is just what makes life worth living or dying the very long monologue spoken by fran oise lebrun is perhaps the most accurate and moving text that was ever written about womanhood manhood and love not easy to translate accurately though this movie is a statement about the difficulty of being a man and a woman or two women in this case and imho jean pierre l aud is one of the greatest french actors

all the talent mr sooraj barjatya showed in his first movies i thought were all an accident because his th one main prem ki diwani hoon was so bad but i have to say it wasn t an accident this guy is talented and the way he has done vivah is just brilliant right from the first scene it affects you the sequences between shahid and amrita are awesome the chemistry between these two actors gives glimpses of that between srk and kajol as usual alok nath as the good and loving father is fantastic so is anupam kher but its a shahid amrita film amrita looks good in most scenes though shahid does look a little young to get married but he does a good job of a shy but yet morally strong groom this movie will especially be liked by those who has gone through such beautiful moments in their life all in all a brilliant film hats off to mr sooraj barjatya
the running man is one of those films that if overwatched would become boring and depressing even my advice is to watch it maybe once or twice a year with a couple of mates and a few drinks in todays climate of tv media domination and the capitalist mode in society it really does work as a revisionist social commentary post s boom forget that though there are other brilliant and better reasons to watch this film schwarzenegger is on top form as ben the butcher of bakersfield richards and the inclusion of bond belting one liners was completely inspired thety are truly leg end dary with his rant to killian over a camera the main highlight the design of the stalkers is authentically american and mirrors the characterizations seen in the pc gladiators tv show and the wwe as well buzz saw s grisly end will chill any viewer to the core as a foot note why does his death stand out as particularly disturbing in what is ostensibly an upbeat actioner with a bitter sense of humour jesse venturer and sven ole thorssen are great as backing muscle and are arnies buds in real life and its even got mick fleetwood in it too what more could you ask for i highly recommend the running man if you re looking for a great piece of entertaining action with a glossty finish and some great characters just don t expect an education from it at least on surface value quality i bloody love it actually you will too unless you re a thesp
it is first and foremost a chick flick it is a romantic comedy there is a fair balance between the two this particular movie has the addition of some pretty sweet fight scenes i don t think any wires were used or if they were they weren t flat out blatant it isn t a terribly complicated movie so it easy on the brain no need to analyze anything to get the deeper meaning pretty simple good chemistry between the leads and a fun watch i d like it if they made brought out the full potential of the girls looks just once cause she can be amazingly cute but throughout the movie they keep it low key kind of pretty i d watch it again with a girl
one can only hope that there are many times when someone as powerful as morgan freeman can take the time to assist someone who needs help it all comes down to loving people as will rogers said i never met a man i didn t like of course if you meet paz vega what s not to like that smile of hers can melt diamonds she is just so fantastic that i can watch anything she is in the same goes for freeman he is just magic on the screen the two of them gave us a film that was funny from start to finish from the mexican supermarket to lorraine bobby to packy it was tender charming and just plain funny you have to check this out

while listening to an audio book cambpell scott is the reader i was so excited to hear his voice and that brought back my disappointment that six degrees was canceled they never seem to keep the good shows on air long enough to capture an audience that can connect with the shows story what a shame and shame on th network for not giving this show a full seasons chance this was an excellent show to watch with a great cast the network gave men in trees a second chance witch is also a great show but they took invasion off and that also was something totally different to watch not the same old same old themes why can t the networks get it right
as part of the celebration of the release of casino royale this film with the new bond starring in it was shown from director roger michell notting hill i almost turned it off for being a bit boring but i m glad i stuck with it basically may anne reid is a single mother of helen anna wilson jones who hardly sees anyone and has not had a boyfriend in years her daughter says that she might want to get married to her new boyfriend darren daniel craig of course after knowing each other only a few days may and darren have a secret affair and at her age with a something and the new bond anyway they obviously want to keep it a secret but may has regrets and wonders if helen will find out when she does darren gets less hassle than may in fact helen asks her permission to hit her also starring peter vaughan as toots danira govich as au pair harry michell as harry rosie michell as rosie and johnny english s oliver ford davies as bruce very good
i agree with all the accolades i went through a box of tissues watching this film it had a gritty authenticity and rang true in every way the question i m about to raise represents a current sensibility regarding the treatment of animals i had a very difficult time with the beginning slaughter of sheep and goats and the dying deer with its pulsing neck and pooling blood as its life drained away was hideous this is the age of no animals were hurt in the production of this move iphigenia was made in the late s before the advent of computer simulation was it possible to fake these animal deaths or were these animals slaughtered for art
outstanding film of with paul lukas giving an oscar calibrated performance as the head of his family bringing them back to america from europe as the nazi menace deepened the usual terrific bette davis maintains her reputation here and for a change was not nominated for best actress for this or any film of encounting treachery around them lukas successfully deals with the situation he knows he must return to europe on a clandestine mission and return he does davis again pulls out all the stops with a katharine hepburn like shedding of tears when they must part resolute she knows that her older son must follow him on his path to liberty a wonderful film highlighting american positive propaganda against a wicked foe
when i first read armistead maupins story i was taken in by the human drama displayed by gabriel no one and those he cares about and loves that being said we have now been given the film version of an excellent story and are expected to see past the gloss of hollywood writer armistead maupin and director patrick stettner have truly succeeded with just the right amount of restraint robin williams captures the fragile essence of gabriel and lets us see his struggle with issues of trust both in his personnel life jess and the world around him donna as we are introduced to the players in this drama we are reminded that nothing is ever as it seems and that the smallest event can change our lives irrevocably the request to review a book written by a young man turns into a life changing event that helps gabriel find the strength within himself to carry on and move forward it s to bad that most people will avoid this film i only say that because the average american will probably think robin williams in a serious role that didn t work before please give this movie a chance robin williams touches the darkness we all must find and go through in ourselves to be better people like his movie one hour photo he has stepped up as an actor and made another quality piece of art oh and before i forget i believe bobby cannavale as jess steals every scene he is in he has the s leading man looks and screen presence it s this hacks opinion he could carry his own movie right now s
the late dudley moore had the most famous role of his too short career in s arthur a raucously funny and alternately touching tale that generates warm smiles big belly laughs and an occasional tear if you re in the right mood moore received a best actor oscar nomination for his performance as arthur bach a drunken playboy who races cars plays tennis fondles women but he has weekends off and he s his own boss arthur is destined to inherit million dollars when he marries a snooty society girl named susan johnston jill eikenberry who is the spoiled daughter of an undercover gangster things get sticky when arthur meets linda morolla liza minnelli a waitress struggling actress from queens who steals neckties for her father s birthday moore lights up the screen in one of the single funniest performances of the last years the late sir john gielgud won a best supporting actor oscar for his flawless turn as arthur s acid tongued butler and best friend hobson whose outward disdain for arthur s behavior covers more paternal feelings there are other funny contributions by barney martin as linda s father stephen elliott as susan s father and geraldine fitzgerald as arthur s demented grandmother the film was directed with a keen eye for comedy by a first time director named steve gordon who sadly died the following the year there was also a forgettable sequel several years later but this instant classic is not to be missed
farrah fawcett gives an award nominated performance as an attempted rape victim who turns the tables on her attacker this movie not only makes you examine your own morals it proves that fawcett can excel as a serious actress both as a victim and victor
moonwalker is absolutely incredible what else can i say michael jackson is the true king of pop rock and soul moonwalker has everything great story line fantastic music great visual effects and of course it has michael jackson
this movie is a journey through the mind of a screenwriter caught in his own paradoxical philosophy he examines the ever illusive question of who am i and what is i it s a courageous and thought provoking enterprise there is a shipload of beautiful images dream inspired escher like paradoxes reminiscent of the hand drawing itself or rather erasing itself more and more we follow the writer in his agony over what to say and what to film we see him phoning with his wife who left for peru leaving him to take care of their baby a task he performs with less and less attention until he s so absorbed in his dilemma s that he hardly looks at the child anymore his wife comes back and makes a scene destroys his notes and helping him go over the last treshold until he erases him self interspersed with eye pleasing and i destructing images the story is mainly philosophical it s about the veils of maya the world of illusion the paradox of the movie however is that it needs a lot of talking and thinking to prove that thinking should stop during the more than two hours of provocative beauty and rapid philosophising the movie made me long for silence or a shorter movie if that was the purpose of the maker he succeeded quite well
great great great that is all i can say about that movie but imdb want at least four lines of text so i ll elaborate the cast was great jerry o connel is soooo cute the music was great the sixties had the best music ever imho the historical material was interesting and so was the way they made the actors of the s seem like they were actually there in the s and most of all the stories of the main characters brought tears to my eyes and that is the greatness of any drama but in one word great
this movie of minutes was aired by the italian public television during the early seventies it tells you the myth attributed to homer of the journey home of odysseus after the troy war it is an epic story about the ancient minoan and mycenaean civilizations told at list years after those events toke place around bc this is a movie so if you buy the dvd version you would find that the sound is just mono and there is no other language than italian even the close caption is in italian pity many people would enjoy this masterpiece if it had at list the english subtitles but if this is not a problem for you than i would strongly recommend to watch this movie
yes shakespeare would indeed have been proud laurence fishburne was not at his best but certainly not bad kenneth brannagh on the other hand was brilliant his scheming was wonderful as was his toying with the audience very nice work there were at times too little drama where more would have been expected cassio s slaying for instance was a bit clouded by too much happening to far apart causing the spectator to twist his head to grasp it all did i mention michael maloney his madness striken roderigo was unusual annoying even if you haven t seen othello before see this if you haven t read othello see this if you haven t heard othello see this you do on the other hand do yourself a favour by reading it seeing it acted onstage and hearing it sung too
never heard of this movie saw it on dvd great movie perfect example of a movie that took every cast member to make it work no overhyped typical hollywood movie with the same old overhyped actors no current quote a list actor could have pulled off any performance in this movie brought back memories of my own post vietnam war military experiences it concentrated on the people who were sent to fight as was portrayed by the characters who had fears and emotions even if some volunteered for service they were regular people too some just weren t cut out for military life i remember a few in my experience to put it mildly couldn t adapt to military life either but i ll never forget them should have stayed in touch i highly recommend it and then think about those serving present day in afganistan basic training is a trip notice those drill sergeants aren t morning people and maybe they need sensitivity training ha ha ha
watched this french horror film last night and pretty much liked it the whole movie takes place in a prison cell with basically three prisoners who find a hand written journal in a wall from a serial killer that had escaped the prison years earlier somehow without leaving his cell as they look through the diary they discover it delves into the black arts and commands that might be their way out of the cell and to freedom what they find out is something completely different and horrifying to say the least i like low budget horror films that deliver the goods in a fairly quality way and tell a good story this movie does just that despite taking a while to get going the result and the horror they unleash is very interesting to me and i enjoyed the ride not a lot of gore but that wouldn t fit the story although the gore it has is pretty good
items or less was made in two weeks on a shoestring budget by writer director brad silberling just a little film shot in carson ca that feels like the entire story was improvised in the best sense of the word silberling had the good fortune to pair veteran actor morgan freeman in between his big projects with spanish actress paz vega and the result is a dialogue between two people from different vantages who manage to enhance the life of the other morgan freeman plays himself yet part of the comedy is that he is depicted as an actor who has been out of work for four years scouting a location for a little filler film to get back into the flow of things his role is to be that of a market manager and he is dropped off at seedy market in carson where he encounters among others one scarlet the girl at the argumentative items or less checkout line not only is scarlet tired of her static job she is also generally angry about her philandering husband bobby cannavale currently sleeping with scarlet s lazy co worker anne dudek and her lack of ability to get a decent job elsewhere the two pair after a few shared problems and off they go on a road trip that results in each of the characters growing from the presence and life story of the other it is a simple story simply told but because of the tender bonding between freeman and paz it works very well this is one of those little films about human relationships where being vulnerable to change and exchange is the message it is well worth viewing and this is a dvd that has featurettes that are touching informative and comic a pleasure to view grady harp
artemisia gentileschi the daughter of orazio gentileschi showed an early promise as a painter taught by her father artemisia was born in an era that denied talented women the right to have their work seen side by side art created by men her tragic life is chronicled in this biographic film directed and co written by agnes merlik having read the novel the passion of artemisia by susan vreeland made us investigate more into the life of this woman her work and her legacy we also read mary garrard s artemisia gentileschi which should be a must read book by all art lovers artemisia presents the fictionalized facts we have read about showing the early life of the young woman as she starts to paint she was clearly influenced by the work of her father by caravaggio agostino tassi and other florentine painters of that period her relationship and love affair with tassi is the basis of the film artemisia unfortunately couldn t go as far as she could have because of the prejudice against women in the arts it didn t help either she caused a scandal where she is accused of being raped by tassi she had to go to rome in order to distance herself from that unhappy time of her life valentina cervi makes a beautiful artemisia she is a gorgeous creature who awakened passion in men michel serrault plays orazio her father miki maojlovic is seen as tassi the man who wanted artemisia but ended up in jail emmanuelle devos appears for a moment the film has a glossy finish that the camera work of benoit delhomme captures in all its splendor the scenic locales of the film offer an idea of what inspired that school of painting to show in their canvases the music by krishna levy serves well what we see agnes merlik directed with sure hand showing a visual style of her own
it ran seasons but it s first in early and it s last in the autumn of were shorter than seasons cbs chief william paley canceled rawhide s production after watching the st show of season in september because he disliked the series without eric fleming as gil favor who had departed after season the last new episode aired in november the lone cbs broadcast on january was a rerun i have often wondered why rawhide didn t switch to color filming for it s last season most of the big westerns of the s had gone over to color by cbs was broadcasting in color that autumn for many of their sitcoms but westerns like gunsmoke and rawhide remained in black and white gunsmoke was the last western and last prime time network series to switch to color on september for the episode snap decision
i love all dogs go to heaven even though i m a guy this and the land before time are the best animated films that don bluth has made in the movie gharlie barkin burt reynolds is helped by his friend itchy dom deluise freedom out of the pound in new orleans charlie who s in casino business wants to share equal with his partner carface vic tayback carface who is unwilling to share the equal with charlie pushes a car on a bridge onto charlie killing him charlie enters heaven and meets annabelle melba moore who shows charlie that his time is up by showing him a watch that has stopped and she explains that all dogs go to heaven because all dogs are naturally good charlie hides the stop watch behind his back and switches it back and he returns to earth alive with annabelle screaming you can never come back charlie reunites with itchy and they go and explore soon to find out that carface has not only attempted to murder charlie he has also kidnapped a little orphan girl named ann marie judith barsi when carface leaves charlie and itchy help ann marie escape the next day charlie itchy and ann marie go to look for money ann marie sees a couple who she thinks would make great parents for her while ann marie talks to the couple charlie sneaks up behind the man and steals his wallet charlie ann marie and itchy then go to a horse race where they bet the man s money that a horse will win the race the horse they said would win winds up winning and charlie itchy and ann marie are payed for the bet charlie promises ann marie he ll use the money to give to the poor but winds up buying a new casino and gambling and buys pizza for his friend flo loni anderson and her puppies soon ann marie has found out that charlie had stolen the wallet from the man and used his money on the horse race and everything charlie sad about this has a dream about going to hell and the devil soon charlie awakens and finds out that ann marie is gone she has left to give the wallet back to the couple who forgive her about the wallet and invite her to breakfast charlie asks ann marie to leave with him and she does pretending to be sick but are captured by mice who try to feed them to king gator but they manage to escape soon carface shows up and captures ann marie he plans to drown her but charlie comes to the rescue and calls on king gator who eats carface charlie s time is up and he must die again itchy with the help of the other dogs finds the couple who took ann marie in and get them to come with them to where ann marie is they are there in time to save ann marie but are too late to save charlie who s time has ended charlie who is awarded for his heroic effort for saving ann marie is welcomed back to heaven but before he enters he says good bye to ann marie who has been adopted by the couple and asks her to take care of itchy for him she says yes and tells charlie she loves him and good bye charlie enters heaven again as it s said all dogs go to heaven filled with wonderful animation characters and story don bluth has proved to us again that he is a good animator it s too bad this movie was release the same year little mermaid which is my favorite disney movie they both came out in which was the year before i was born i guess i ll have to call them both the best animated features of out of
all i can say about the necromaniac schizophreniac series is if you are even remotely pc or don t have a seriously messed up sense of humor then you probably wont get it as sick and disgusting as this movie is it really is a comedy and not a horror movie at all if you can appreciate somebody who pushes the bounds of good taste and political correctness to the most extreme limits imaginable to the point where is becomes so out of hand that it s comical then you must see this to believe it this movie is so out of control that a major film studio couldn t touch this with a foot pole with a condom on the end in my opinion though the best most extreme pieces of art come from way underground if you don t stick to the same old formula that people are used to seeing then they reject it i have seen stacks of terrible boring z grade indy movies that were just a waste of a perfectly good vhs tape or dvd r i have also seen stacks of stink bombs coming from the big named studios that were a complete waste of millions of dollars when a no budget film like these two from ron atkins john giancaspro come out and blow all of the other shock films completely out of the water you really have to take a second look at the whole indy movie scene after seeing this you can really see how much freedom an indy film maker can have when they work on their own the funny thing is even the other people who saw this movie and hated it admit to the fact that they laughed all the way through it i don t think that is is possible for anybody to get bored watching either of these two so if don t take everything that you seen in the mainstream media too seriously and are able to laugh at a misanthropic puppet wielding psychopath who has finally snapped you have to see this you may just be able to see it for the stand alone cult classic that it is both schizophreniac schizophreniac are among the favorites in my collection of well over dvds
while the kiss of the spider woman cast raul julia as a political prisoner in an unidentified latin american country this time he works for a dictator in a fictional latin american country specifically the dictator suddenly drops dead so julia replaces el presidente with a broadway actor richard dreyfuss shooting a movie in the country from there dreyfuss has to figure out how to be a dictator all the while balancing it with his own life is it appropriate to turn the tense situation in latin america into comedy well moon over parador does a good job with it no matter what they do in this movie they pull it off it just goes to show why richard dreyfuss is one of the greatest actors of our era and what we lost when raul julia died definitely worth seeing also starring sonia braga who co starred with raul julia in tkotsw jonathan winters and sammy davis jr i agree the first lady is hot
put quite simply this film is terrifying it starts off simply looking like a study of a rebellious young girl and goes on to become a beautifully crafted horror film don t expect gore or zombies this is psychological and just as he would also do in candyman bernard rose manages to convey the horror that is not being believed each time you watch this film you realise more about what s happening and about how the two worlds in this film interconnect drawings have never been scarier
i am not a very good writer so i ll keep this short world at war is the best wwii documentary that i ve seen i ve seen different wwii documentaries not only english north american and this documentary seems to be the most complete wwii documentary that i ve seen i think it could talk a bit more about the great depression and why how hitler got to power but it does a very good job at covering the war it seems to be complete and objective fair to everyone it does not exaggerate or diminish roles of different nations it has a lot of original footage including color footage and many eye witnesses it was made in s when a lot more were alive it has great music and narrator all in all i gave this one because it s that good i haven t seen specials in dvd version so i cannot comment on those
i saw this in theaters and absolutely adored it geoffery rush gave the best performance as a super villain that i have ever seen since gene hackman as lex luther kel mitchel and paul rubens were a match maid in heaven this film also introduced me to william h macy who is now one of my favorite actors hank was great as the blue raja and i especially loved that the character wasn t really british the scene with him and telling his mom that he was a superhero almost brought tears to my eyes i loved the fact that the bowler talked to the ball some of the funniest stuff involved stiller and his character mr furious s false rage and the fact that his threats and one liners were all gibberish and that they never made any sense i could barely stop myself from applauding when he said fraculater freinken puss was said but one of the things i most enjoyed was that captain amazing actually dies in the movie i highly recommend this film for any occasion and i give it my own personal two thumbs up
those who only remember the late sir peter ustinov as hercule poirot or a professional raconteur would do well to seek out this charming piece of late s satire ustinov stars as a convicted embezzler we first see him during his last day in gaol where he is preparing the prison governor s tax return who sensing that the future is in computers poses by means of a deft piece of identity theft as a computer expert and sets out to infiltrate an american multinational ustinov who co wrote the script is on top form as is the delightful maggie smith here unusually cast as an accident prone cockney sparrow dolly bird bob newhart also puts in an amusing performance as a suspicious executive who has designs on maggie smith in addition karl malden is satisfyingly sleazy as ustinov and newhart s womanising boss what do i particularly like about this film not only is it a well thought out caper movie but it s also a touching little love story ustinov and smith are very convincing as the two misfits stumbling into love the whole scene involving the deck of cards is particularly effective so what is there not to like well the script is no more computer literate than most films that is hardly at all even though it captures the feel of late s big iron business computing quite well also there are a couple of small plot glitches that you re not likely to notice until the second or third viewing but i consider these to be minor niggles as i said this is a film which is well worth seeking out and after you ve seen it once you ll want to see it again at regular intervals
adam jones has a brilliant sense of humor there is nothing i didn t like about this film cross eyed was beautifully shot adam does a great job of not only developing the main characters but also the minor characters cross eyed gives hope to every low budget film out there that you don t have to spend a lot to create something worth watching there is something to like for everyone if you ve had a terrible roommate if you ve ever picked on a dork in high school if you ve ever parked anywhere in the city if you have any type of sense of humor at all you will love this film this is the type of film that will be around for a long time and ends up resurfacing again once adam makes a bigger name for himself i look forward to adam s future projects
i ll be honest i got this movie so i could make fun of it i mean come on hood of the living dead what other reaction could i have the thing is though the movie and its makers decided that it wasn t going to be made fun of instead it was going to try its best to be a good movie and you know what it came awfully close a little less cheese in the incidental music a little more professionalism in the photography the acting the incidentals like the props love the best buy bag well it s not a classic of the zombie movie genre but it s still a pretty neat little movie on its own and the acting writing and pacing are all surprisingly better than i would have expected there s even some decent humor as two of our leads debate how to decide if a dead zombie is really dead if you can overlook the low budget which leaves its fingerprints in everything alas and the almost constant profanity this can be a pretty fun time at the movies no it ain t great yes it could have been better but the makers the actors the crew they all tried to make a good film instead of a camp classic and that counts for a lot the line of campy zombie films is a mile long and thank you guys for not adding to it kudos to the quiroz brothers i d love to see what they do next and hey somebody give them a budget
despite its budget limitations this is a great film proof that effort and imagination can overcome lack of cash the opening in which cave paintings seem to show how some dinosaurs at least survived into the age of human beings is a nice red herring after that a meteor comes down into a lake and causes heat which in turn causes the hatching of a frozen dinosaur egg maybe the cave paintings suggest instead that this isn t the first time such a thing has happened when the prehistoric beast appears it s a well animated plesiosaur which is soon causing disappearances in the local area alright so it s not jurassic park but it s still genuine entertainment for fans of monster movies
this movie is difficult to watch in our fast paced culture of the st century but it is worth it for the messages that it conveys chiefly the consequences and ramifications of technology upon society specifically when that technology is used for warfare this movie presents a full circle cycle of dehumanization and rehumanization as influenced by the advent of technology and the subsequent deconstruction of civilization and therefore serves as a cautionary tale against the misuse of technology but as the circle completes itself familiar themes and sentiments pop up again to present self serving rather than self destructive ways that humanity may utilize technology brilliant for it s time the picture and sound quality may pose a challenge for some but as a landmark in the history development and evolution of the sci fi genre it is a must in the end free will and free choice are once again posed to humanity as a means for controlling our own destiny rather than having it served to us by someone else or indeed the state ofsociety itself as shaped by world events those who are downtrodden by what life throws their way sometimes tend to remain so but yet there is always a glimmer of hope and continuity that remains as this film posits as far as qualifying as sci fi one of the biggest common demoninators of that genre is it s speculative nature it asks us the questions what if these events happened this way and what effect would it have on society or the individuals within it how would we react as far as influence this film projects those speculative sciences that make sci fi as unique as it is and keeps us asking those important questions
it s hard to say anything about a movie like this because there isn t enough words to give this magnificent stylish and unique film the veneration it unquestionably deserves they should make this the official and only true real hamlet movie because all the previous films out of the same immortal spectacle are being overshadowed by kenneth branagh s hamlet it s a perfect complete version of the play potent massive earthshaking first class masterpiece shakespeare would have been proud of they ve packed over a dozen of world famous top actors in the same film and everyone of them is having one of the greatest performances of their career every moving and charming sequence leaves behind a comprehensive sense of satisfaction the cameras embrace gracefully the enchanting coulisses branagh is phenomenal in the leading role his sharp irresistible performance is the only one of it s kind and will be permanently part of the glorious movie history every second in this presentation is feast for the movie lover from beginning to the very end branagh s version of hamlet is among the ten best motion pictures ever
i don t doubt that victor mclaglen won his best actor oscar for this film by dint of a three way split among the mutiny on the bounty leads of clark gable charles laughton and franchot tone who were all in the same race but the informer is still a fine film because john ford wouldn t have gotten his first best director oscar if it wasn t no split involved in his award the movie and the story by liam o flaherty that it is based on involves a poor simpleton of a man named gypo nolan who was once a member of the irish republican army he was cashiered out of it for some imbecilic stunt he pulled and wants back in he s down to his last pence and if he can t get back in wants enough for passage to america there s a twenty pound reward for information leading to the arrest of a former comrade named frankie mcphillip played by wallace ford in a moment of weakness he goes to the black and tan constabulary and informs on mcphillip the ira is pretty anxious to find out who ratted mcphillip out and they re pretty certain it was mclaglen he hasn t the wit to really cover his own tracks he does make a feeble effort to implicate another man named peter mulligan played by donald meek he also picks up a hanger on played by j m kerrigan the whole action of the informer takes place in in dublin from about six in the evening to early the following morning of a necessity it is shot in darkness and shadows making it possibly the first noir thriller had it been done post world war ii the informer would have ranked as a great noir classic like odd man out or the the third man which it bares a lot of resemblance to john ford knew this world very well he took some time off during the rebellion and was in ireland at the time and had a brother who was in the ira his real name before having it anglicized was sean o fiernan preston foster plays the ira commandant dan gallagher in the book gallagher is a harder and meaner man than foster has him here my guess is that john ford wanted him as a sympathetic character to give movie fans some rooting interest he makes it clear that foster has to eliminate the informer because the black and tans will grab him and get quite a bit more out of him and put the whole organization in peril the ira trial scene is the highlight of the film when foster asks donald meek whether he recognizes the authority of their court meek ain t in a position to say no the king s justice and writ does not run here it graphically illustrates at that point despite occupation by army troops and constabulary the british are indeed losing their grip on the population of course the informer a rather grim story has its john ford touches but rather fewer than you would expect even as mclaglen is spending his money on a drunken spree the ira is constantly in the shadows watching him and counting every farthing the informer is a tale well told about ireland in a grim and dismal time
those who love the book jane eyre as i do it s my all time favorite and i re read it at least once a year will love this version timothy dalton is just a tad too good looking to be mr rochester but other than that he does a marvelous job portraying the brooding master of thornfield zelah clarke may have been just a little too old to play the year old jane but when i watch this movie i don t think about the ages of the characters the dialog from the film is taken almost verbatim from the book which was very smart sure this film might seem a little long but it s the only version i ve seen that includes part of the story i wish the people who made this film had been involved in the newer zeferelli version as it would have helped that mess of a film i also realized the last time i watched this video that judy cornwell plays aunt reed she is so versatile that i didn t recognize her she plays daisy in keeping up appearances and also played mrs musgrove in s persuasion another wonderful adaption update got the dvd this week and it s marvelous to see the original unedited version there s lots more at the beginning young jane at gateshead and at lowood and at the end they ve restored lots of things i always wondered why st john had a slip of paper when he reveals that he knows who jane is because the part where he tears it from her painting was edited out of the us vhs version rosamund oliver is in it she was completely cut out of the vhs as far as i could tell they hadn t edited out any of timothy dalton s parts so nothing new there but it is great to see the whole miniseries in its entirety after all these years of enjoying the vhs thanks bbc ps i would have paid more for a special edition dvd with maybe some interviews with the stars or a making of show
this film was on last week and although at that time of the day around pm the quality of the movies is almost never good at least here on mexican tv i couldn t switch the tv off the story about madelene moore really touches you she doesn t come across as a very sympathetic character at first but seeing the whole film you just want her so succeed this film really leaves you thinking and i think that basically due to the great acting of brooke johnson i had never heard of her before nor knowingly seen her in another film but this was great great acting compliments to brooke i hope to see her in another film soon
why did this movie fail commercially it s got a sharp script by ron shelton and great performances by kurt russell and especially robin williams in a brilliant manic nerd turn that s different from any of his other work a great renter
it s not quite the timeless masterpiece you would hope it would be based on the acclaim it garnered but s midnight cowboy is still a powerhouse showcase for two young actors just bursting into view at the time directed by john schlesinger and written by waldo salt the movie seems to be a product of its time the late s when american films were especially expressionistic but it still casts a spell because the story comes down to themes of loneliness and bonding that resonate no matter what period the film s cinematic influence can still be felt in the unspoken emotionalism found in ang lee s brokeback mountain the meandering plot follows joe buck a naive young texan who decides to move to manhattan to become a stud for hire for rich women full of energy but lacking any savvy he fails miserably but is unwilling to concede defeat despite his dwindling finances he meets a cynical sickly petty thief named ratso rizzo who first sees joe as an easy pawn the two become dependent on one another and rizzo begins to manage joe things come to a head at a psychedelic drug infested party where joe finally lands a paying client meanwhile rizzo becomes sicker and the two set off for florida to seek a better life this is not a story that will appeal to everyone in fact some may still find it repellent that a hustler and a thief are turned into sympathetic figures yet their predicaments feel achingly authentic in his first major role jon voight is ideally cast as he brings out joe s paper thin bravado and deepening sexual insecurities as rizzo dustin hoffman successfully upends his clean post college image from the graduate and immerses himself in the personal degradation and glimmering hope that act as an oddly compatible counterpoint to joe the honesty of their portrayals is complemented by schlesinger s film treatment which vividly captures the squalor of the times square district at the time the director also effectively inserts montages of flashbacks and fantasy sequences to fill in the character s fragile psyches credit also needs to go to salt for not letting the pervasive cynicism overwhelm the pathos of the story the other performances are merely incidental to the journeys of the main characters including brenda vaccaro as the woman joe meets at the party sylvia miles as a blowsy matron john mcgiver as a religious zealot and barnard hughes as a lonely out of towner the two disc dvd package contains a pristine print transfer of the restoration and informative commentary from producer jerome hellman since unfortunately neither schlesinger nor salt are still living there are three terrific featurettes on the second disc a look back documentary after midnight reflections on a classic years later which features comments from hellman hoffman voight and others as well as clips and related archive footage such as voight s screen test controversy and acclaim which examines the genesis of the movie s initial x rating and public response to the film and a tribute to the director celebrating schlesinger
this cute animated short features two comic icons betty boop and henry henry is the bald slightly portly boy from the comics who never speaks well here he does speak he wants to get a puppy from betty boop s pet store and when he is left to mind the store some hilarious hijinks ensue betty sings a song about pets henry gets in a battle with birds and a monkey but everything works out in the end
easily one of the ten best movies of the th century in cold blood is brilliant in the simplicity and realism of its storytelling and absolutely riveting robert blake walks away with the film the story seems to be presented almost entirely from perry s viewpoint despite dick being the leader and planner of the pair the viewer will invariable perceive dick as being more unstable immature and generally feel like perry would not have been pulled into this nightmare but for dick and his need to be somebody and pull off a big score based on a true story with particular attention to accuracy in cold blood depicts the story behind the brutal and senseless murder of a rural kansas family one cold windy night because dick has bought into an age old rural myth about prosperous farmers having a safe full of cash in their home as prosecutor a character that isn t given a name in the script played by will geer so astutely points out their lives are bought for only a head director richard brooks wisely chooses not to share with us the gruesome details of the murders until the end of the film prior to this we only know it has happened and watch the lives of dick and perry slowly unravel as they attempt to escape not only being apprehended by law enforcement but also perry s own ever escalating sense of impending doom he repeatedly makes remarks no one ever gets away with a thing like that and i can t help thinking we left something behind that belongs to us dick is neither mature nor moral enough to feel any compelling sense of guilt over their crime only irritation at perry s indeed after they are caught it is dick who breaks first and suddenly faints when finally confronted with irrefutable proof that places the two men at the scene of the crime i felt somewhat sorry for perry from the very beginning of the film and more so as events progressed but i only loathed dick the genius of the film is the engaging manner in which the story is played we do not for a moment think we are watching actors portray characters but that we are watching the actual participants and events as they occurred the story is unrelenting taunt the run time slightly in excess of two hours feels more like just a few minutes for those of you who are interested in such things i noticed a couple of the goofs listed here on the imdb page for in cold blood are incorrect or exaggerated such as the reversed process shot at the beginning of the film as dick and perry are driving across the bridge into kansas to begin with this isn t even a process shot the camera is actually positioned in the backseat and the image you see beyond the windshield of the car is real a large cargo truck located to the left front of dick s pontiac creates the optical illusion that they are going backward because it is traveling at a greater rate of speed but closer examination will reveal that they are indeed going forward and it is an actual shot filmed from a moving vehicle as i previously stated this is one of the ten best works of th century cinema not recommended for the very young due to some course language and implied and inferred violence no actual in your face gore as a modern film would resort to but a thoroughly excellent film
personally i disdain the jerry springer show however i found ringmaster to be the funniest movie i ve seen this year the never ending satire of jerry springer guests starting in the opening scene keeps you laughing throughout the movie despite a brief scene in which jerry springer makes a feeble attempt at justifying his existence i definitely recommend this movie for sheer entertainment value
this movie is essentially shot on a hand held camera by the actors in it in some ways a mockumentary in other ways a video diary from killers it is full on account of a columbine style attack while this movie does not answer all the big questions it does give you an insight into how easy it would be to get away with through the movie you are shown how the actors illegally shortened shot guns made pipe bombs and came up with an action plan for zero day the actors if you can call them that were brilliant they obviously borrowed heavily from there own lives but at no stage did i detect them really acting something tom cruise should try the use of the cctv and the operator at the end was genius but i m not sure if we needed the very last scene overall though a really good movie on a very tough topic
riveting drama scripted by william mastrosimone based on his stage play in which farrah fawcett plays marjorie attacked in her car by rapist joe james russo she manages to get away but the cops inform her that there is nothing they can do she realizes however that joe did get her wallet and knows where she lives when her housemates pat alfre woodard and terry diana scarwid are off at work joe pays her a visit to finish what he started after joe humiliates and degrades her in a variety of ways she gets a chance to strike back at him and imprisons him knowing full well she s in another his word against yours situation and that no rape technically took place she has no intention of taking it easy on him until he confesses to pat and terry what his intentions were the movie ultimately amounts to a showdown between its two opponents as it goes on marjorie displays such ruthlessness that one has to wonder if she hasn t become as unhinged as her nemesis fawcett does a creditable enough job while russo is truly excellent as the depraved creep who does his best to manipulate the situation with only two characters on screen for much of the running time the film has an intimate nature that does suggest that it would work even better on stage director robert m young doesn t shy away from the uglier and more exploitative elements of the situation the film does become uncomfortable to watch at times and by the time marjorie has the upper hand things change enough so that it no longer becomes quite so easy to encourage her to go for blood and one hopes that pat can make her see reason extremities i felt was a pretty good movie that at least maintained interest and a fairly high level of intensity woodard and scarwid are both fine in support scarwid has a great moment where terry reveals herself to be a rape victim and the pace is consistent granted the dialog isn t always very sharp but the material is compelling every step of the way
the story of cinderella is one of my favorites from charles perrault with sleeping beauty which was also made into a disney film in this film is a sweet enchanting masterpiece from disney the film has a great soundtrack that s one i like in a movie is a very good soundtrack and i love the songs too my favorite song is the romantic so this is love i love the mice from the film too they are cute my favorite scene is the scene after the narration the little birds tried to wake cinderella up in the morning i also love it when cinderella s animal friends the mice and birds fix up cinderella s birth mother s dress so she could go to the ball until drizella anastasia tore it to bits the b es
with a minimal budget a running time of eight minutes and a great amount of imagination nacho vigalondo has achieved one of the most moving shorts i ve ever seen the subtlety of the screenplay is really remarkable since it doesn t give the ending away until the very last moment don t let anybody tell you what the short is about since you ll be able to enjoy it a lot more nacho vigalondo is the discovery of the year for his one man show directing writing and acting in this formidable short is the most remarkable effort i ve seen in years also pay attention to the performance of marta belenguer her reaction shots are incredible overall rating

hey now i can t claim to have seen all of the films of jesse jesus franco and there sure seem to be a lot of them but this is one of the better and weirder of the lot that i have seen i d say most likely he was in his prime back in the late sixties early seventies and anything lately has been a bit too strange for me and it takes a lot for me to declare that anyway this is like one big bad dream where parts of it seem to come true at various points this woman is an actress or something performs in some theater in berlin where acts of fake torture are performed for an appreciative audience and she seems to have this problem with dreaming the catch to what s real and what s not in this movie is apparently the real stuff is in sharp focus and the dream stuff isn t she seems to exist in a state of deja vu i won t say this makes a whole lot of sense but it is pretty wild and weird and entertaining shots of berlin make it seem like a lonely and creepy place so that adds to the atmosphere the ending is extremely abrupt though the film just ends and the tape went black i guess no need to let you know it was over at that point my copy was from the anchor bay euro trash collection and i say give me more euro trash i can t get enough of that crap but it s good crap
arms and the man is one of shaw s funniest plays if handled correctly and this production does a good enough job helena bonham carter pre film stardom is raina the daughter of a military family who has a peacock of a fianc patrick ryecart and who shelters a soldier from the enemy pip torrens during a raid on the town full of colour and energy this production rips along at a good pace and if bonham carter and patsy kensit as the maid are outshone a bit by the rest of the cast they still hold their ground kika markham and dinsdale landen as the parents are delightful and the whole play is generally a happy one highly recommended
when this movie so well proves that they indeed are unnecessary although few lines it was kind of weird to see this movie no subs in a language unknown a friend of mine sent a vhs included a few pieces of papers with all lines translated to english with her translation next to me i began watching this tale it is indeed a tale and from the very first tunes of the whistling melody during opening credits i was stuck the colours that minimal acting well in most cases absurd comedy slapstick thoughtful beautiful along with a few other movies paris texas and nenette et boni this one is able to speak to anyone s heart without words whenever you get the chance see it whatever you do don t miss it it s a once in a lifetime experience oh acting is great the soundtrack is brilliant the story is simple and told a thousand times before but rarely never like this
hatred of a minute is arguably one of the better films to come out of michigan in recent years not to say that it s a brilliant film by any means but it s definitely worth a watch hatred chronicles the sordid adventures of eric seaver played by director kallio a formerly abused child now grown up and starting to listen to his evil side hatred is very nice visually the shots are creative and the lighting is approporiately moody and interesting to look at this film actually has an element of production value to it unlike other recent michigan releases like dark tomorrow and biker zombies subtle dolly shots and stylized shot composition show good use of this film s budget however hatred stumbles in the same places that so many other local films do and that s in the story and character department essentially things just kind of happen eric seaver doesn t evolve at all basically he s always been crazy it s just that people are starting to notice the film just wanders along its merry way with very little development also the ending is very abrupt however since this is a horror film since when do we care about plot we just want to see people die and hatred certainly delivers as the body count mounted people in the theater started cheering kill her kill em all when people scream back at the screen it s always fun that s the place where hatred succeeds it s fun and in the end that s all that really matters
for all of you that don t speak swedish the swedish original title of this film r narna translates into something in the line of the robbers this fact is the main problem i have with the film cause it s not really about the robbers at all it s about a young woman working for the swedish police researching robberies a regular desk job one would think but this girl is soon out on the field taking matters into her own hands as the story goes even shooting one of the robbers exactly we ve seen this before the fact that there s a rather interesting twist to the plot halfway through doesn t really help as the ending is just as clich as the first two thirds of the film what saves it from being just another mainstream film is the fact that it s masterfully executed in all ways that the actors are as great as they are and don t overact and that the director really manages to keep it as thrillingly exciting as it is for the most of the story one thing that i really loved about this film is the fact that it s music sets the right mood when it s needed but is absent for the rest of the time which gives a nice sense of reality to the shootouts and car chases spread throughout the film a nice touch the fact that michael persbrandt is one of the few swedish actors that often tend to get typecasted sadly hurts the film as you know that he s not going to just play the boyfriend of the heroine and be a supporting character in the background but that s something you have to neglect all in all it s an entertaining film that steals more money in it s plot than time from you
i wouldn t call we re back a dinosaur s story simply a kiddie version of jurassic park i found it more interesting than that like the former it calls into question the security of bringing beings from one era into ours but it really opens my eyes when i see who provided the voices john goodman rhea perlman jay leno walter cronkite julia child kenneth mars yeardley smith martin short and larry king to paraphrase that a given actor the cheers woman the tonight show host the most trusted name in news a famous chef the young frankenstein police chief lisa simpson one of the three amigos and the cnn guy but i guess that i shouldn t focus only on the cast i thought that this movie had something for both children purely fun and adults natural history true it s escapism but the perceptive kind i would actually say that john goodman doing rex s voice here is sort of a precursor to his voice work in monsters inc worth seeing
we watched this in my women s health issues class to point out how women are treated inferior to men in many societies and i absolutely loved this movie i plan on trying to get a copy of it myself to watch the story is very touching and i would recommend it to anyone i am a fan of different cultures and this movie was just what i needed this is a movie for the whole family despite its rating this is a movie i will show to my children the professor of our class meant for the movie to primarily be a too to educate about women but this movie was more than that it is one of those movies that will forever stick out in my mind and will be a favorite
you can survive surviving christmas i thought the television version was a bit edited way down i like ben afleck he plays drew johnson a family less adult who is willing to pay complete strangers the valcos starring james gandolfini and catherine o hara as the parents and christina applegate as lisa valco the daughter drew is lonely around the holidays because he doesn t have a family of his own so he rents out a family in the chicago suburbs for a quarter million dollars bill macy who i best remember for playing maude s husband arthur is hired to play duda the grandfather when the whole situation comes crashing down the truth can be painful the valcos household is crumbling apart from the drew situation drew s rich girlfriend and her parents make a surprising visit you can t buy what you wish for the acting and writing is mediocre but the first rate cast pulls it through to the final scene
iq is a wonderfully original romantic comedy that pits the greatest and deepest thinking scientific minds of the th century as cupid s helpers the juxtaposition of heart and mind is the central theme of this light hearted yet thoughtful movie you don t quite know how to react because part of the time you are seeing great scientists do silly things to nurture budding love but at other times you hear them discuss some of the deepest puzzles of space time of our age the end result is a fun movie with surprises throughout walter matthau is a perfect einstein meg ryan creates a quirky scatter brained mathematician and tim robbins brings to life the contradictions of a poorly educated working man who is fascinated by science all together they create a farcical trip through love and science mind and heart
musically speaking irving berlin gave fred astaire and ginger rogers another pluperfect musical after top hat if that was possible although in this case like that jerome kern confection roberta that they were in follow the fleet retained randolph scott with another singer this time harriet hilliard randolph scott is a career navy cpo and fred astaire is an ex vaudevillian who enlisted in the navy to forget ginger rogers his former partner but now the two are on shore leave fred and ginger take up right where they left off and randy accidentally meets ginger s dowdy sister harriet who blossoms into a real beauty but randy s a typical love em and leave em sailor again irving berlin wrote a hit filled score with him tightly supervising the production ginger gets to do some really outstanding vocalizing with let yourself go which she and fred later dance to but the real hit of the show is let s face the music and dance which is a number done at a navy show sung first by astaire and later danced to by the pair let s face the music and dance is one of the great romantic numbers ever written for the screen their dancing on this one is absolute magic i m sure that when i mention harriet hilliard a few younger people might ask who that was but they will know immediately when i mention her in conjunction with her famous husband ozzie nelson that s right ozzie and harriet it s something of a mystery to me why harriet stopped singing when she just became david and ricky s mom on television then again she didn t even keep her own name neither ozzie or harriet sang on television ozzie was a pale imitation of rudy vallee as a singer but harriet could really carry a tune she sings get thee behind me satan and the moon and i are here but where are you both with real feeling and class i recommend you see follow the fleet if for no other reason than to hear a dimension of harriet hilliard incredibly forgotten today
yesterday i went alone to the cinema because here in mexico most of the times movies from other countries are part of the so called cam ra alternativa alternative camera but after i saw this movie i realized that not all the foreign movies are alternative afortunately this is a good a example but i have to said that i enjoyed so much this movie that at the end i was happy this movie is a little spoon of hope in these days and the main lesson for me is that at the end of the day the love is main force behind us this is a good option to see a good movie in spanish and i have to mention the good music specially the main song of the movie cosas que hacen que la vida valga la pena excellent song
the straight story is the tale of an old man who decides to visit his sick brother who lives across the state line he decides to make the trip on his lawnmower as he can t drive and he wants to make the rip by himself the film beautifully depicts his journey and the lives he touches along the way richard farnsworth turns in a beautiful performance as do the rest of the cast most notably sissy spacek in an endearing performance as his daughter and harry dean stanton in a small but infinitely crucial role at first i felt that a story of an old geezer trip across the country side would be dull but i soon discovered that lynch with all the insights in to the man life makes this a movie i would recommend to anyone
this film is an hour or so of good entertainment and has some genuinely funny moments i loved the character of matt and also tiny they seemed the most engaging and funny characters and certainly the most interesting matt is very good as is his no good cousin and the police woman and the blonde biker woman provide some welcome eye candy i must say i saw striking similarities between matt and another aussie actor eric bana my personal favourite part was the brothel scene loved that overall i liked the film and it ll get about an rating the penalty however i was disappointed in it was a side foot curl rather than the appropriate laces blast i am of course kidding
in paris avalon a computer generated system controls the city and when a young woman is kidnapped detective karas craig must go against avalon to find her renaissance is a splendid blend of film making mixed with a conceptual futuristic narrative that lights up the screen in a shocking manor with a noir themed ideology and conceptual montages that should delight many pixar are the animation masters their numerous oscar winning films are endless from the charming toy story to the mystifying wall e and so any company or director has a real challenge to knock them of their perch renaissance isn t a film aimed for the young audience though and like s persepolis brings a strong and mature approach to the genre of animation to make an older and more challenging film to its targeted older generation in robert rodriguez released a shockingly brilliant noir sin city that shook up the whole usage of green screen with a splendid balance of filming in black and white with the odd spurts of colour and a year later christian volckman took up a similar approach with this equally visually masterful stroke of film making volckman s picture however is a full on animation but it doesn t half look realistic for the majority of it s strong hour and minutes of running time the faces of the character s are well portrayed and in particular this film has got to be the finest ever for the usage of shadow the fact we never know if its night or day is irrelevant when simply gazing into the stony faces as the shadows blend across their expressions it is almost a clever use of pathetic fallacy and is finely directed also for anyone who has seen persepolis you will have come to the conclusion it is one of the finest directed animations ever screened for the simple but highly conceptual artistic style by marjane satrapirenaissance is equally on terms with that picture and in many instances rivals it with stronger graphics and a darker tone to reflect the mood one scene in particular when karas appears out of darkness is beautifully shot the narrative revolves around a stubborn and nosey political government who keeps tabs on every citizen the running of paris is down to the mysterious avalon which we don t see nearly enough to get an essence of its true dominance renaissance is controlling the narrative around a tired cop s attempts to rescue the mysterious woman and then we see craig s tired and boring cop attempt a rescue whilst battling with other elements there are many things wrong with the scripting not to mention the tired exasperated cop routine is now old but there is plenty of dashing adrenaline and springy banter between characters to keep it alive right till a wonderfully shot shocking last couple of stages
of all the movies of the seventies none captured to truest essence of the good versus evil battle as did the sentinel i mean yes there were movies like the exorcist and other ones but none of them captured the human element of the protagonist like this one if you have time check this one out you may not be able to get past the dated devices as such but this is a story worth getting into then there are all the stars and soon to be stars my absolute favorites were eli wallach sylvia miles and burgess meredith then there are the subtle clues that lead to what s going on too pay close attention i had to watch it four times to catch on to all the smaller weird statements like black and white cat black and white cake plus the books are really good as well i m just sorry that they re not going to turn the second book into a film it s so scary that it would outdo this movie
one thing i always liked about robert ludlum thrillers is just when you think you have it figured out it goes in a completely different direction there are so many twists and turns in this film that i have a sore neck from watching one thing i also like about director john dahl kill me again rounders unforgettable is that he can be depended upon to direct and in this case write with his brother rick a good story now add nick cage dennis hopper lara flynn boyle and j t walsh to the cast and you have a story that will keep your interest even if they are playing characters that all of them have perfected dahl seems to bring out the best in folks and this will keep you interested and guessing until the very end
i really liked the movie i remember reading it several times as a kid and was glad to see a movie had been made about the book i was kid sitting for a boy and a girl ages and and had to talk the girl in to seeing the movie but happily at the end she was glad she saw it and even said that she wanted to buy it on dvd as soon as it came out there were some great laugh out loud moments and the movie was not as gross as i expected it would be tho it did rank pretty high up there on the gross o meter the only thing i cannot figure out is why they had to have the dilly line in there that was done by woody in reference to his private part that to me was the only shocker moment and you could hear the adults in the audience audibly gasp at that moment in the movie i have no clue why that was put in the movie it added nothing to the actual movie except for that shock gasp factor other than that a pretty good movie nice to see the pepsi girl all grown up
this movie is simply awesome it was a very sensitive issue and movie was superb this movie did not create any controversy in india as far as i know and its publicity was also kept low initially i thought that this movie would simply be a waste of time since most of the indian directors and producers used to change the theme even though its very sensitive and adds a love story in original story and spoils the whole thing most of the indian viewers would agree on this topic if they remember ashoka mangal pandey loc etc there have been so many movies in india which would have become milestone or mega hits if the love story part would not be unnecessarily added but its treatment is pretty similar to pinjar movie also a must watch if it counts then i would like to thank anil kapoor producer and firoz abbas khan the director for making such a great movie
beyond the excellent direction production acting the predictable drama lies an essential message in the script listening leads all the way in order for the voice to flourish listen to harmonise with other in voice listen in order to approach yourself listen to discover the needs of any situation or others listen it appears that the script writers are conveying a life s secret listening leads to an awareness of one s self it awakens the other senses especially vision expands the horizon one s soul too can be discovered the artistry of this movie as it is in heaven magnificently displayed the unfolding of life not only its joy sadness but ultimately the hope of life all this by the leading character s first instruction to the choir just listen it leads all the way
this movie is ok if you like mindless action corny acting and a very small plot the special effects are decent considering this movie is from the director of event horizon the costumes are like something from a mad max movie none of the soldiers talk so others tell them what to do it eventually end up as a big shoot em up movie with explosions all the place i personally liked russell better in tango and cash escape from la new york and executive decision it must see this movie leave your mind at the door for a no brainer action science fiction movie

all definite selling points for sea hunt just what was the reason for producing a sort of sea going gun for hire series let s look closely now there must be a some clues around if we were to look back just a little we see the rko radio pictures production of underwater it starred jane russell gilbert roland richard egan and lori nelson as a quartet of very attractive scuba diving adventurers working on salvage in the carribbean including a pre fidel cuba the film was moderately successful and was memorable not necessarily for its story as for the looks of the principals in swimming suits fine shapely women folk in some really keen piece bathing suits woo woo woo woo are always a plus for the guys and the presence of rugged athletic men folk displaying their best beefcake poses is equally pleasing to the gals and there is one element that is a true legacy of this old rko feature it is on the soundtrack contained in between the musical queues and themes it is the recording of it s cherry pink and apple blossom white written by louiguy and jacques larue and performed by damaso perez prado and his orchestra anyone who hears this insturmental or song with lyrics will not soon forget it its carribbean beat is so very lively and its rich use of the brass section of the orchestra is powerful and instantly renders instant impression and memory the rpm record of this song made it to the top most popular songs of the week for many saturday evenings on nbc tv s your hit parade we can t remember just how many weeks nor just how high it got maybe some one can fill us in on that one item please so we got back to sea hunt and its own odyssey in getting on the tube the public had taken to underwater all right but would they go for a tv series ziv tv productions was getting a reputation for putting out a type of product that for the most part didn t get signed on by the networks for the multi station hook up treatment but they had been having some great successes with television syndication by that we mean offering a series for stations for showings on a one to a tv station per each market area much like the various newspaper syndicates sell comic strips to various papers around the country and world even so we got mike nelson himself in the physical presence of lloyd bridges mr bridges had been around for approximately years or so and had turned in some very memorable performances in mostly supporting and highly varying roles in a couple of boston blackie movies with chester morris to they stooge to conga stooges sahara also home of the brave and the whistle at eaton falls lloyd brought a very convincing manner to his characterization along with a fine convincingly athletic physique having the look of a guy who makes his living with his physical abilities he took very well as the diver s diver whether it s performing duties on board ship or fathoms beneath the sea and lloyd did take to the role quickly but contrary to a lot of misinformation out there he was not familiar with s c u b a prior to landing this mike nelson gig but the athletic mr bridges proved to be a quick learner as so many of the close up shots underwater revealed that there was no doubt about it that it was lloyd with the mask the bubbler air tank and the flipper fins stories almost always involved the helping out some client for pay much like a private detective would so what if the client was a lovely lady who looked good in the bathing suit all the better like so many of the other ziv united artists tv productions sea hunt possessed a fine haunting opening theme and closing along with some original incidental music and queues at one time i believe that sea hunt was the top syndicated tv series a success that ziv series had known before with the likes of science fiction theatre and highway patrol as far as the showing venue for this underwater saga here in chicago it was shown late night after p m on wnbq tv channel our nbc affiliate now known as wmaq tv and i can remember just who was the original sponsor in this particular market was and there were even on scene commercials done by the star how well we can remember and visualize lloyd as mike nelson riding on his power boat and as we were being invited to return the next week and watch another adventure of sea hunt sponsored by the g heileman brewing company of lacrosse wisconsin the makers of old style lager beer all while mike was toasting us raising an old style bottle shame on you mike drinking beer on your moving boat we re tellin the coast guard then the boat would leave the dock accompanied by the sea hunt theme and rolling the credits note more figuratively than literal mike was for hire and things ran very much like a deterctive story note ziv s syndicated successes included science fiction theatre west point and its clone men of annapolis sea hunt and highway patrol note and of course scuba is a acronym for self contained underwater breathing apparatus
the house of the spirits is a gripping tale of family intrigue south american politics and super natural powers meryl streep glenn close and jeremy irons bring isabel allende s novel to life with all its passion and suspense this in my view is one of the best films of the s jeremy irons as esteban trueba ages and mellows very believably while meryl streep in the role of clara maintains her gentle loving warmth throughout her relatively short life winona ryder and antonio banderas make a handsome couple struggling for family acceptance in a racist culture glenn close as esteban s sister gives a very moving performance the countryside of portugal is a reasonable substitute for a non tropical latin american country settings of clara s home and esteban s ranch are effective and the period us cars add nicely to the post war atmosphere
my year old loved it i loved it my wife loved it so out of from our family as for violence level not really that violent mostly of the slap stick variety nobody truly dies no gore no blood no torture so it certainly is appropriate for children much more so than many saturday morning cartoons this movie really takes the idea of cg movies where it should go first of all beautiful graphics textures wonderfully done with true depth not trying to be realistic but forming an artistic whole the moss on the stones the rust on metal the reliefs on the wood and the stone everything adds to the whole character modeling unlike many contemporary cg movies is quirky not cute again within an artistic whole the faces may look less malleable than in some other movies but the characters are more puppet like than human like i think that is a good thing it lends veracity how strangely it may sound it is easier to suspend your disbelief hair fur clothing on par at least with the likes of pixar just note in the opening scenes when lian chu is fighting the giant slug gwizdo is in front of some farmers and all of them have detailed clothing which caused me to pause the movie just to admire it the setting far beyond the likes of cars and even wall e space has been done many times but the fantasy environs of dragon hunters are only comparable with some scenes in never ending story and lord of the rings but again it is an artistic whole and with lots of good ideas thrown about effortlessly magnificent vistas like the scene in monsters inc where they ride all the doorways through its storage facility or wall e where we see the immense trash towers he made abound in this movie everything is grand yet never dwelt upon it is just the background the whole way the interlude where they walk through the area with the fantastic falls the chinese wall the islands floating in the sky the broccoli in the sky that is truly where i believe cg should go make something which takes your breath away and do it again and again the sound is good the music is varied and not only epic and thankfully without any vocals and purely original for the movie animation is quite good lending its inspiration to cartoons especially some good use of stretch and squeeze sometimes not that realistic but the d models are not realistic either characterization is well done too lian chu the gentle and uncertain giant is gradually growing in confidence basking in the attention of little zo gwizdo the wily manager of lian chu redeems himself in the end while zo isn t really changed at all but who wants that cute child to change anyway i at least loved lian chu more than any other recent character since sulley in monsters inc the internal strife in the group gets ironed out by the external pressures just as it should in a proper fantasy story the story is mostly reminiscent of the never ending story especially how the world brakes apart the monsters are pretty standard fare except the flocking one it lacks the emotional impact of wall e which is the really strong point of that movie but it is a much more fun ride and lacks the annoying musical scene replaying in the former one and has action from the first scene this movie is what you want to watch for a fun and exciting time the whole movie has as i ve mentioned a whole vision which seems to have been followed rigorously throughout it seems that the setting is ready for more adventures and i for one would hope so one side note the french actor doing lian chu sounded a bit like jean reno at first but i m happy it wasn t him though he is one of my favorites nice to hear a new to me voice i give it a max rating a bit surprised at the mediocre and low ratings by some i have tried to address some of the concerns made by two of the reviews with the lowest vote approach this movie as an adventure and as a european movie not opposed to hollywood but different
this is one of the greatest child pet movies ever created i cry every time i see shadow yelling wait wait for me peter as the family car is pulling away this is a must see if you love animals best movie ever the lines in the movie are sometimes stupid like when sassy says to chance cat s rule and dogs drool lines like this i could do without but when i was six i bet i loved that line the storyline may seem hooky to some but i like it shadow as the older dog who s preparing chance to take over for him when he s gone is really moving when you think about it it reminded me of my childhood dog i think everyone can find a piece of themselves in homeward bound
a series of vignettes most of them spoofing television of the s but also with some digs at the government and corporate america one of the longest segments the dealers is not that funny to me and i don t know what it is parodying some of the others though are absolutely side splitting i particularly enjoy the cooking show segment most of the foul words i know are used in the movie and if you object to full frontal nudity stay away
hickory dickory dock was a good poirot mystery i confess i have not read the book despite being an avid agatha christie fan the adaptation isn t without its problems there were times when the humour and there were valiant attempts to get it right was a little overdone and the events leading up to the final solution were rather rushed i also thought there were some slow moments so some of the mystery felt padded however i loved how hickory dickory dock was filmed it had a very similar visual style to the brilliant abc murders and it really set the atmosphere what with the dark camera work and dark lighting the darker moments were somewhat creepy this was helped by one of the most haunting music scores in a poirot adaptation maybe not as disturbing as the one in one two buckle my shoe which gave me nightmares the plot is complex with all the essential ingredients though not as convoluted as buckle my shoe and in some way that is a good thing the acting was very good david suchet is impeccable i know i can t use this word forever but i can t think of a better word to describe his performance in the series as poirot and phillip jackson and pauline moran do justice to their integral characters brilliantly and the students had great personalities and well developed on the whole particularly damian lewis as leonard all in all solid mystery but doesn t rank along the best bethany cox
i think that this movie is very fun and horror i love elvira and i like this movie it s very pity that second part of this wonderful movie had no success because it very funny like a first part i also regret that besides of this movie i have no seen cassandra peterson in other films i think that she is amazing actress with big potential i hope that ii ll see her in future in the third part of elvira s adventures cassandra peterson is one of my favorite comedy actresses cassandra if you read this know that you are the best and my heart will be with you you can rely on me what can i more add this is cool and classical movie
if you want to learn something about the spanish civil war and about all the political details and intrigues let me tell you you ve chosen the wrong film this is a vision of the war as it happened in majorca a small island off the coast of spain when a war like this happens in a small island that takes position for the traitor almost at once there is no war in the open the soldiers are sent to the front to fight in the mainland while another kind of war happens at home on the small island there neighbours tell on other neighbours sometimes because their political views are contrary to the new regime but many people are told on because of old family fights or maybe the silent introvert who has no friends is told on by someone who wants to earn some points and these things don t happen in the open there were some trials true but many other times people would just be woken up in the middle of the night taken out of their homes to the closest cemetery where they would be killed and the next morning the bodies would be found and people would have an idea of what had happened but nobody would dare to speak or to do anything we re not talking about soldiers killing someone they had never seen in their life we re talking about people killing their neighbours and probably saying hello to their widow the next day and even attending the funeral for the guy they had killed we re talking about villages with one or two thousand inhabitants where everybody knew everybody i am from that small island and i ve heard the stories my grandparents told me and i must say that this film upset me oh yes it did but i also found it remarkably beautiful and moving the initial violence is not something the director or the writer made up that s how things happened during that war a kid knowing that his mate s dad is in the fascist squad that killed his dad completely possible all that happened later on possible too tb was real too at that time my island was not the holiday resort it has become people were poor illiterate and worked in small farms after the war there were times of hardship so you won t find a war story in this film or at least not the kind of war story you expect there are no battlefields no soldiers no political intrigues this is the meanest kind of war which happens when the space is limited just check the size of the island when neighbours fight with their neighbours when members of the same family fight each other and they live in a place where everybody knows everybody you ll find a story about the damage that this particular kind of war can cause to people and the story of how they survive that damage or maybe they don t i must mention the excellent work done by the writers who adapted the novel and by all the actors who managed to sound really majorcan that was remarkable
this is one of the best of the genre i saw it twice about yrs ago and have not had another opportunity to see it again since then it rivals the zatoichi series also starring katsu in exciting swordplay
this is one of the greatest sports movies ever made by hollywood what a wonderful story about one of the great sports figures of american history what makes the story of james j corbett especially interesting is that mr corbett introduced the style of boxing that continues to this day in that respect james j corbett was truly innovated but getting back to the movie all the performances were excellent alexis smith was beautiful indeed she looked like nicole kidman and although it s a period piece the story withstands the test of time it has not gone stale ward bond s portrayal of john l sullivan has to be one of the great portrayals of an actual sports figure in the history of movies and the boxing scenes are realistic well staged and highly effective that coupled with a great script makes this movie a must
if the redundancy of getting off the boat on the boat off the bus on the bus is a way to waste time then you should go back to the hollywood films that wrap this part up in one montage in order to get to the money shots and in doing so leave you unconnected and in the cinematic limbo that results from not really showing the realities of life the long drawn out travel sequences actually allow the viewer the same frustration and wait in line feeling the characters must endure frustrating yes vital indeed the limbo of that travel is the key to the rootlessness of this turkish family beautiful film with great acting sad but worth it
the unlikely duo of zero mostel and harry belafonte team up to give us some interesting performances and subject matter in the angel levine it s one interesting twist on the themes from it s a wonderful life zero is married to ida kaminsky and the two of them belong to a special class of elderly jewish poor in new york mostel used to be a tailor and proud of his trade but his back and arthritis have prevented him from working kaminsky is mostly bedridden he s reduced to applying for welfare in desperation like jimmy stewart he cries out to god for some help now maybe if he had gotten someone like henry travers things might have worked out differently but even stewart had trouble accepting travers but travers had one thing going for him he was over years off this mortal coil and all his ties to earthly things were gone god sent mostel something quite different the recently deceased harry belafonte who should have at least been given some basic training for angels before being given an assignment belafonte hasn t accepted he s moved on from life he s still got a lot of issues he also has a wife gloria foster who doesn t know he s passed on hit by a car right at the beginning of the film you put his issues and mostel s issues and you ve got a good conflict starting with the fact that mostel can t believe in a black jew named levine this was the farewell performance for polish jewish actress ida kaminsky who got a nomination for best actress in the shop on main street a few years back the other prominent role here is that of irish actor milo o shea playing a nice jewish doctor remembering o shea s brogue from the verdict i was really surprised to see and hear him carry off the part of the doctor the angel levine raises some interesting and disturbing questions about faith and race in this society it s brought to you by a stellar cast and of course created by acclaimed writer bernard malamud make sure to catch it when broadcast
from the upper shelf of great classic books comes this masterful story written by pearl buck the book like the movie is called the good earth it relates the story of wang lung paul muni a simple chinese farmer who begins his day with a trip to the great house where he has taken a slave woman called o lan luise rainer and made her his wife almost from the beginning she begins to adapt to his kindness by saving a small peach seed and planting it near her new home during the following years o lan proves her worth by steadfastly sharing her husband s toil troubles and changing fortunes through the passing years they raise a family and watch their simple household weather both feast and famine indeed it s at the lowest point in their lives that each discovers the value of companionship loyalty and love with the changing times their growing family is both aided and threatened with friends and relatives like their uncle walter connolly who is a scoundrel and charlatan but is compassionately tolerated wang has his old father charley grapewin to advise and remind him of life s fragile and fickle nature two notable actors who make impressive appearances in this film are keye luke who plays wang s elder son and phillip ahn who plays a nationalist soldier the film is in black and white and is wonderfully adapted from the novel highly recommended for all audiences
i had no expectations i d never heard of jamie foxx all i knew was that the film has some strong character actors in it i thought it was highly entertaining it was fun the plot was different and unpredictable enough to hold my interest to me foxx is an original david morse is terrific true this is not his finest role i thought the chases and pyrotechnics contributed to the film and were well done i didn t expect a lot and i was happily surprised
this version of the dickens classic a christmas carol directed by clive donner stars george c scott as ebenezer scrooge by this time around the challenge for the filmmaker was to take such familiar material and make it seem fresh and new again and happily to say with this film donner not only met the challenge but surpassed any expectations anyone might have had for it he tells the story with precision and an eye to detail and extracts performances from his actors that are nothing less than superlative especially scott one could argue that the definitive portrayal of scrooge one of the best known characters in literary fiction ever was created by alastair sim in the film but i think with his performance here scott has now achieved that distinction there is such a purity and honesty in his scrooge that it becomes difficult to even consider anyone else in the role once you ve seen scott do it simply put he is scrooge and what a tribute it is to such a gifted actor to be able to take such a well known figure and make it so uniquely his own is quite miraculous it is truly a joy to see an actor ply his trade so well to be able to make a character so real from every word he utters down to the finest expression of his face and to make it all ring so true it s a study in perfection the other members of the cast are splendid as well but then again they have to be in order to maintain the integrity of scott s performance and they do frank finlay is the ghost of jacob marley a notable turn though not as memorable perhaps as the one by alec guinness as marley in the film scrooge angela pleasence is a welcome visage as the spirit of christmas past edward woodward grand and boisterous and altogether convincing as the spirit of christmas present and michael carter grim and menacing as the spirit of christmas yet to come david warner hits just the right mark with his bob cratchit bringing a sincerity to the role that measures up well to the standard of quality set by scott s scrooge and susannah york fares just as well as mrs cratchit the real gem to be found here though is the performance of young anthony walters as tiny tim it s heartfelt without ever becoming maudlin and simply one of the best interpretations and the most real ever presented on film the excellent supporting cast includes roger rees fred holywell and also the narrator of the film caroline langrishe janet holywell lucy gutteridge belle michael gough mr poole and joanne whalley fan a flawless presentation this version of a christmas carol sets the standard against which all others must be gauged no matter how many versions you may have seen watching this one is like seeing it for the first time ever and forever after whenever you think of scrooge the image your mind will conjure up will be that of george c scott a thoroughly entertaining and satisfying experience this film demands a place in the annual schedule of the holiday festivities of every home i rate this one
the movie starts off in a classroom setting where not surprisingly our main actress orked was seen in a chinese language class later in the film she was asked on why by mukhsin that she was sent to learn mandarin her answer was simple for a child she is coz she s already known the malay language well it s a bit of a romance one may thought of it but once you ve stopped yourself from reading too much critics and go for it you ll notice the typical elements of malaysia the movie basically focuses on year old orked who met year old mukhsin in a game of which many would think of it as a boy s game running out of players mukhsin who was new in that village was forced to allow orked into the game in which she eagerly showed the male side of her orked is no such ordinary girl as she depicts more of the male behavior as you will see in the movie defending mukhsin from much violent encounter with her school bullies throwing one of the bully s bag out from the school bus window throwing punches and kicks on mukhsin s brother where after he teased mukhsin and so on and so forth both were awesome buddies and stick closer than that but with a slightest of misunderstanding in which most of us would all respond to in the same way parted the both of them until the day when mukhsin left town now the movie depicts the first love between orked and mukhsin they started out as friends but slowly evolving into somewhat more of a closer relationship and then towards bgr you would notice the changes yasmin made in the movies for each of the main actor and the actress when they go through love the different character was portrayed with eagerness and mild humor the scenes were all in random but it depicted so much reality in it that you d be stuck on the screen for a long time you will love the movie for what it is and not because that you want to be patriotic to the local scenes coz it means much more as the movie envelopes around the two love birds it also manages to find its lens towards orked s parents her mother who was educated in england speaks very good english and in which her husband and the caretaker in the house with very much attempt tries to speak back their own kind of english which was humor all the way indeed let me just explain to you why humor can be such a prominent thing in this movie and that explanation or description that you may portray can be given in only one word and that is randomness often more than not we don t learn to laugh at ourselves and when we do we do it at the expense of others it is just like what the movie just follow law by jack neo would have mentioned often when we are ourselves we don t see the person in us we are but when only when we are in another person s body then only would we learn to see who we really are and that is how humor applies as well more so than just dignity the movie was filled with such randomness that the typical facts of our routine lives as we carried it out could be all the way filled with laughter if we want it to be the other focus of this movie was on how orked s neighbor a couple in which the husband is no longer loving to his wife and wanted to find another pak koboi as what he s nicked after was seen polishing his motorbike daily and would take it out for a ride with his newly found girlfriend the producer did not fail to show you perhaps why the husband wanted to find another wife the wife was a real hurler or kpc as we chinese would call it having interrupting on other people s business and sending her own daughter to tease orked in words only adults would use after all what goes around comes around and that s probably why bad things kinda want to happen to her in every time being nice to people around you won t hurt at all unless you have an ego to protect but then again what s it worth the movie also centers around mukhsin s brother hussein who would go out to town everyday until very late at night smoking drinking and also finding girls he s the total opposite of mukhsin but that s all perhaps because of family problems both the brothers were staying with their aunt and the parents were far away from them i will not reveal more of the story line as it would spoil much of the interest in wanting to find it out for yourself but the slightest of all elements in which the producer wanted to send a message across to the viewers is the life of us all she wanted us me at least to view life from our own perspective when we are not ourselves movies in a way take us out from our own body places us in the character s position and use our empty mind then to view on the happenings of it depending on the type and genre of the movie you will be mesmerized by how a good movie such as this would portray and imply a significant impact on you
rudy does it again with this hot off the streets follow up to dolemite this entry is filled with the requisite rudy ray moore raunch humor and martial arts rudy eludes a crazy red neck sheriff in this movie that also features an infamous scene where rudy dives down a steep hill see it for laughs and for a brain blasting hit of blaxploitation magic
spoilers within it appears that von trotta was a lot more at ease with what the balance of personal story versus history of the events than she was in her earlier film versprechen das the direction seemed carefully controlled and visually i felt it was highly appealing especially where the visual narrative was concerned the title sequence blend and the lighting of a new candle in modern times commemorating the deaths of various characters in the past to clarify two points that many people have been confused by firstly lena did not sleep with goebbels although this may have seemed implied it was not the intent von trotta told me so herself and she is a very nice lady by the way secondly the time frame of events was in fact historically accurate the actual dates are shown on the close up of the memorial and the prisoners were released as suddenly as in the film there is evidence showing that goebbels was annoyed about having done this and had planned to eventually recapture those he had set free overall what most impressed me most was that it was an original story from a much over movied era it seems a shame that it has taken such a long time for various reasons for this film to hit our screens more of the same please margarethe
i watched the first series avidly but wondered whether i d go back again after a lengthy break from it however i tuned into episode one of series and was hooked all over again this really is excellent telly ground breaking stuff like mission impossible back in the s the characters are well rounded and expand as the series goes on they change as they adapt some more readily than others to their new surroundings but they cleverly remain strictly in character and yet it is more than possible to have sympathy for someone whom you wouldn t have thought you could ever feel sorry for when something really crushing happens to them i hope there will be many years of lost to look forward to and i don t actually mind all that much if i never get answers to all the mysteries
the young victoria is a elegantly costumed and reproduced bit of history that benefits from some fine settings solid direction by jean marc vall e of stalwart julian fellowes version of the youthful lass who was to become england s longest reigning monarch victoria much of the early portion of the film that part when victoria is a child whose ascent to the throne is contested by her mother miranda richardson and sir john conroy mark strong seems to drag and get lost in the multiple costumes and scenery variations but once victoria emily blunt comes of age and is courted by prince albert rupert friend the film blooms blunt is a strong actress and finds that delicate line between girlish infatuation and royal dignity that makes her a fine foil for those at court who would seek to control the child queen including her secretary lord melbourne paul bettany but as she matures into her role as queen her eye dwells on the dashing german prince albert and a love affair that has lasted in the memories of everyone is matched by the concept of joining royalty with concern for the care of her subjects much due to the sensitivity of albert the film takes us to the birth of their first of nine children and then ends with some statements about the influence of queen victoria and prince albert s effect on the various royalties throughout europe it makes for an evening of beautiful costume drama and allows us to appreciate the growth of two young stars in emily blunt and rupert friend a solid if not transporting epic grady harp
and laugh out loud funny in many scenes the movie s basic plot is well chronicled a story of opposites trying to find a way to survive each other in close proximity this is unquestionably lemmon and matheau s best film as co stars and the interaction between the sloppy oscar and the ocd felix are classic the scene where oscar lines up a double date leaves the room briefly and comes back to find felix and the two girls all crying is pricelessly funny for any fan of intelligent comedies the odd couple is a go out of your way to see it film
here s an oddity a modern day film about a serial killer that has no fight scenes nobody seen dying no car chases and no loud noises and it takes place in russia there are only two short action scenes but they are horrific the rest of the story is detective work and how much red tape the poor detective had to go through to solve the murders this is a very somber movie and somber best describes the personality of the hero stephen rea as well yet the story is not depressing and it s very interesting all the way through rea is outstanding as the determined harried looked detective jeffrey demunn is downright scary as the killer donald sutherland s russian accent is suspect but he plays the only character in this film that has some warmth once again the story is dotted with liberal agendas here and there with not one but two references to bias against gays the total validity of secular psychology police and government officials being boorish crude bigoted yadda yadda yadda otherwise it s an intelligent and refreshingly low key crime film this is a somewhat unique film that probably is not well known but is well liked by the people who have seen it since it s based on a true life account of this killer it s all the more chilling don t pass this by just because you haven t anything about it
batman mystery of the batwoman is the latest animated batman straight to video dvd movie to be released minor spoilers ahead the plot revolves around a new crimefighter the batwoman who seems to be personally involved for whatever reason in stopping a major arms shipment although the movie is interesting enough it s not as good as mask of the phantasm sub zero or return of the joker the main reason being is that it doesn t give off the emotional appeal the other movies did at the end of this movie we don t really feel sorry for anyone as we did in the others especially sub zero there is no real tragedy that made the other animated movies special for us even the batwoman is not really a tragic character as mr freeze or phantasm were not only that but batwoman s alter ego seems so incredibly stiff and dull that the viewer doesn t really care what happened to her that caused her to put on the mask or what happens to her at the end and therein lies the main reason we don t get this special emotional appeal don t get me wrong i did find the movie enjoyable it does have its moments such as when the audience finds out who batwoman really is and seeing an old villain return who was last seen in the original batman the animated series the action is also very enjoyable with some very suspenseful moments if the batwoman s background was more interesting this movie would have been better than return of the joker in my book but as it is now it s in th out of as for the animation it s the same as the new batman adventures cartoon from the mid to late s the score is not as memorable as the previous animated batman films but it s still good nonetheless i do recommend buying this dvd because despite its flaws it is enjoyable but just remember it s not as good as the other batman animated movies
spoilers while the historical accuracy might be questionable and with the mass appeal of the inaccurate lotr such things are more easily excused now i liked the art ness of it though not really an art house film it does provide a little emotionally charged scenes from time to time i have two complaints it s too short and the voice you hear whispering from time to time is not explained quality entertainment replayable
sandra bernhard s without you i m nothing the movie released in followed on the heels of her off broadway stage production what she and others refer to in the movie as her smash hit one woman show there were several changes in monologues and one liners and the movie version visually re vamps the story taking sandra from a fabulous existence as a successful stage performer in new york during what she calls her superstar summer to an illusory almost desperate existence back in her home in los angeles her fictional manager in the film refers to it as getting sandra back to her roots to upscale supper clubs like the parisian room there s a point to be made here sandra tries to appeal her liberal worldview and her sometimes harsh critique of american pop culture to an audience that doesn t completely see it in l a she s playing to a predominantly black audience trying to relate her ideas when all these people seem to want is shashonna a madonna look alike stripper and even then with shashonna dancing to drum beats that resemble those from like a virgin there s not much to be said for the audience s enjoyment of the show the scene in the club throughout the movie is dryer than a bone a funny scene to catch is of a rotund man from the audience helping shashonna out of her pants but if she s going down sandra s doing so with style and force conveying everything from foul confidence to punctured vulnerability right to the point at which she s naked literally pleading for acceptance and yet somehow still swimming in the pool of her own transparent stardom her depictions of interactions with the likes of calvin klein jerry lewis bianca jagger ralph lauren and what we re lead to believe is warren beatty are fictional and hilarious sandra begins her show in her most awkward moment performing a quiet but mystifying rendition of nina simone s song four women while dressed in a mufti and other african garb singing lines such as my skin is black my hair is wooly and they call me sweet thing she resurrects and celebrates the ghosts of underworld art in a tremendously funny description of the frenzied estate auction for andy warhol leave it to andy to have the wisdom and sensitivity into the hours and hours of toil and labor that went into the indian product that they ve been so lucky to cash in on this whole santa fe thing happening she expounds on the excessiveness of hollywood consoling a distraught friend then admonishing him saying mister if this is about ishtar i m getting up right now and walking out of your life forever because that s too self indulgent even for me sandra illustrates the expectations of women in the age of feminism dressed as a cosmo girl sandra retells her young girl fantasy to become an executive secretary and marry her boss she eventually concludes in relief i ll never be a statistic not me i m under and i m going to be married sandra extols the opening of sexuality in society when he touches you in the night does it feel all right or does it feel real i say it feels real mighty real finally she cries for change in progressive american society by channeling disco greats patrick cowley and sylvester and proclaiming eventually everyone will funk all this comes in the form of glitzy schmaltzy but wonderful cabaret performances of songs written and originated by billy paul burt bacharach hank williams and laura nyro to name a few at the same time the idealized fictional incarnation of sandra her self generated mirror image floats around town a beautiful black model with flowing gowns and tight bustiers reading the kabala studying chemistry and listening to nwa rap music in without you i m nothing sandra bernhard explores emotions and existences that up until then she d only toyed with as a regular guest on late night with david letterman her almost child like enthusiasm for shock exhibited throughout the s is thrown aside in the face of a subtler allure and her confidence in the face of materialism and american celebrity proves refreshing this approach to comedy would change sandra s direction forever and mark the more mature more personable entertainer to come if you like subtle humor to the point of engaging in inside jokes about glamour celebrity sex loneliness despair and shallow expressions of love and kinship this movie will keep you in stitches it may not be meant to be funny across the board perhaps it s a bit unsettling or even maudlin for some but consider the emptiness of the world sandra paints for you and you ll understand just how funny and brilliant she really is but see without you i m nothing with a friend in the know because it s definitely funnier that way before you know it the two of you will be trading sandra barbs and confusing the hell out of everyone else
for those of you who are not aware with the theme that kusturica continues to explore intermittently in his films the western assault on traditional serbian values it will be impossible for you to understand his narratives this continuous theme expressed through fantasy and outrageous comedy as its vehicle is one that kusturica has elected to mandate since his fantastic work and magnum opus underground kusturica s films black cat white cat life is a miracle and recently with promise me this his slapstick carnivalistic style underscores the westernization of balkan culture its ambivalent arrival and assault on the traditional idiom in the case of promise me this the paradoxical world of city urban space and village traditional idiom space are contrasted the world of the city reflects western attributes that have ensconced the spatial and temporal setting organized crime sexual exploitation a ruptured sense of identity and vehement disregard for traditional values as expressed toward the young kid villager the end of the film further exemplifies this notion as we observe a funeral mass and wedding on a one way dirt road they are on a collision coarse appropriately the wedding which represents the lifeline and pulse of the village i e traditional values are about to collide with the funeral mourners exemplifying the death of tradition within this context yet kusturica brilliantly examines this theme through his own unique stylistic singularity with his outrageous and flamboyant style serving as a vehicle in its portrayal
for animation buffs it s a must but even general audiences will enjoy the cameraman s revenge a very early example of pixilation by the hard working pioneer wladyslaw starewicz starewicz and his helpers painstakingly manipulated a cast of flexible insect figures to tell this story paving the way for the likes of willis o brien george pal ray harryhausen and legions of modern digital effect creators the cameraman s revenge is only about minutes long but packs in lots of amusing detail as the story follows the amorous adventures of two beetles from their home to a nightclub a hotel a cinema and eventually a prison cell there are two brief dance numbers at the nightclub performed by a frog and a dragonfly a scuffle between a beetle and a grasshopper and a large scale donnybrook at the cinema which ends with the projector bursting into flames pretty elaborate goings on for when even john bray and winsor maccay were just getting started and walt disney was still in grade school it s interesting to note too what an impact the alteration of a silent movie s title cards can have on the story being told i ve seen two versions of this film offered by two video companies and watched them back to back and although the image content itself is almost identical two different sets of intertitles tell two very different stories and the plot outline someone provided above tells yet a third story which suggests that there s another version out there somewhere the british film institute s print which has rhyming intertitles tells the story of two sibling beetles each secretly married who hide this information from one another in order to inherit their late father s fortune the other russian print tells a simpler story of married beetles who are each guilty of infidelity in the russian version mr beetle visits his girlfriend at the gay dragonfly nightclub while in the english version brother bill beetle visits his wife at the music hall personally i prefer the straightforward and spicier russian story the bfi version tries to cram too much plot into what should be a simple tale and some of the rhymes are a bit awkward still in any rendition the cameraman s revenge is a delightful film and would make an ideal lead in to that other great animated work which features beetles yellow submarine
in an era of such awful cartoons i am rather in shock to see a movie with such good morals make it to the imdb bottom list for animated movies this movie does contradict the first i won t deny that however when i was in the target age group for this movie i didn t even notice nor would it have mattered if i did the people who made it may have used new generation to note that this is another way the care bear family could have began perhaps we are meant to decide for ourselves how the care bear family truly began this was my favorite movie at age and it did not scare me or confuse me at all
hilarious hardly begins to describe this one of a kind genuine tour de star wars force luke how strong vader the strength of a small pony in which being the master he is he doesn t even break a sweat ingeniously sparing himself mascara leakage and that s with almost hours of whirling his way thru history its birthplace europe and more from heimlich s middle of the night i ve invented a maneuver to the british empire s do you have a flag and ancient deadbeat gods jeff the god of biscuits and many more this is fish flop on the floor to jumpstart your lungs funny and i confess to having passed on this video dozens of times over the years seeing as a british transvestite standup vogueing on a chair is one longshot of a rental after all especially one going back years now and yet the material is not only timeless but almost oracular turning present day into nothing more than an amplified funnier sadder version of where we were at a decade ago although come to think about it that may just be a coincidence
a fine effort for an australian show which is probably not surprising seeing as there seems to be somewhat of a resurgence in quality aussie drama dare i compare this show to the brilliance of love my way no but it is reminiscent of early secret life of us the cast is great gibney works her magic in the first two episodes i have seen the british cast is strong also especially the callum and lizzie characters but abe forsythe may be the saving light not that it needs saving if this show is to get another season i wasn t a fan of his performance in the awesomely awesome marking time mini series a few years back but he was great as hal in always greener its also good to see brooke satchwell again lets hope the show keeps improving with each episode
only a from me a perfect ten would have been if there was more of a plot to the movie but nevertheless moonwalker to this day remains a fun fest of music dance and entertainment beginning with the montage of video clips from jackson s long career it reminds the viewer of just why he is often regarded as the king of pop from his hit i want you back to we are the world the multi award winning charity record for the benefit of africa following this a short movie of sorts although lacklustre in an oscar winning script nonetheless provides a fantastic and entertaining drama for the audience ending with a perfect sexy rendition of come together something the whole family can watch and enjoy
jean harlow and clark gable were a great on screen team and this may be their best movie together yes hold your man can be cheesy and predictable but that s not what i love about the movie i love seeing harlow and gable together and in this film they are simply wonderful it is obvious that they really enjoyed working together and that is part of what makes this such a wonderful film the witty dialogue great script and attention to detail are the other things that make this such a good movie i loved this movie the first time i saw it and on each subsequent viewing i always notice at least one new detail to me that is a mark of a great film the dialogue and script are better than most movies from this time period early s i adore classic movies but i admit that most of them are just average and at times don t hold my interest hold your man is one of the exceptions this has a lot to do with the fact that hold your man is a pre code movie the hays code was not enforced until a year after hold your man this movie could not have been made under the code well it could have been made but it would have been an entirely different story thank goodness the code was not enforced until otherwise we would have missed out on this gem
actually this movie has silly moments both in the claymation part and in the joe pesci and children part and it s much worse than other mj movies like the wiz captain eo and ghosts but as a die hard michael jackson fan since almost eleven years yeah that s half my life you guys i can t complain too much about it just seeing this lovely guy and hearing his wonderful music is a trip to heaven for me but as a movie it s not good at all and i m afraid that it would get a much lower grade for me if my darling mike hadn t been the one starring in it but since no one but mike is the moonwalker it has to get a out of from me
okay there are a ton of reviews here what can i possibly add i will try anyway the reason this is my favorite scrooge is because of everything the sets outdoor locations costumes are so beautiful and authentic the music is sweet the supporting cast is very well done one of my favorites is the narrator nephew played by roger rees his understated sincerity is touching and his voice is the sound of christmas to me david warner is also a totally believable bob cratchit his is a difficult life but he remains positive and dignified the best part of course is george c scott as ebenezer scrooge some have said his portrayal too gruff i couldn t disagree more his exchanges at the beginning while cold or harsh weren t out of character he is a terribly disillusioned man who s heart has been hardened by the vicissitudes of life and his own lust for wealth during the flashbacks it s obvious that he isn t all gruff this is where we see that there is hope for him if he was totally gone his partner marley would never have come for his sake in the first place and after all we are none of us past hoping i think that is a huge part of what dickens was trying to say when scrooge looks in on his dance at his employer s with belle you see him smile regretfully as he tells belle in the flashback that he will go through life with a grin on my face clive donner was smart enough as the director to allow these moments on film sometimes they get left on the editing room floor and finally his conversion is so absolutely full of joy that it makes me cry tears of joy every time i see it his apology to his nephew fred so sincere so moving it is the spirit not only of christmas but of humanity itself the joy he brings to fred to his wife are so apparent and the line that gets me every time god forgive me for the time i ve wasted bravi tutti
after realizing what is going on around us in the news in our homes the whole new world i remembered this show and how obsessed i was watching it every week in my town i started looking for this series days ago didn t have luck till this moment and i was shocked when i read about it and about cbs people i believe they stopped the show because it s talking about something way ahead of our understanding of the new world it was trying to deliver a hidden message about something terrifying the people who stopped it are the same who are controlling the world now i remember in one of the episodes it was talking about the one dollar and the pyramid with the one eye
the secret of kells is an independent animated feature that gives us one of the fabled stories surrounding the book of kells an illuminated manuscript from the middle ages featuring the four gospels of the new testament i didn t know that this book actually exists but knowing it now makes my interpretation and analysis much a lot easier there are a few stories and ideas floating around about how the book came to be who wrote it and how it has survived over years this is one of them we are introduced to brendan an orphan who lives at the abbey of kells in ireland with his uncle abbot cellach voiced by brendan gleeson abbot cellach is constructing a massive wall around the abbey to protect the villagers and monks brendan is not fond of the wall and neither are the other monks they are more focused on reading and writing something abbot cellach does not have time for anymore he fears the northmen those who plunder and leave towns and villages empty and burnt to the ground one day a traveler comes from the island of iona near scotland it is brother aidan a very wise man who carries with him a special book that is not yet finished abbot cellach grants him permission to stay and brendan buddies up with him aidan has special plans for brendan first he needs ink for the book but he requires specific berries the only way to get them is to venture outside the walls and into the forest an area off limits to brendan seeing that he is the only chance for aidan to continue his work he decides to sneak out and return with the berries before his uncle notices his absence in the forest brendan meets ashley the protector of the forest she allows brendan passage to the berries and along the way becomes akin to his company she warns him of the looming danger in the dark and not to foil with it there are things worse than vikings out there from there brendan is met with more challenges with the book and the looming certainty of invasion i like the story a lot more now that i know what it is about knowing now what the book of kells is and what it contains the animation makes perfect sense i m sure you have seen pictures or copies of old texts from hundreds of years ago with frilly borders colorful pictures and extravagant patterns creatures and writings adorning the pages much like the opening frames of disney s the sword in the stone the animation here contains a lot of similar designs and patterns it creates a very unique viewing experience where the story and the animation almost try to outdo each other i couldn t take my eyes off of the incredible detail this is some of the finest d animation i have seen in years it s vibrant stimulating and full of life the characters are constantly surrounded by designs doodles and patterns in trees on the walls and in the air just floating around it enhances the film the story is satisfactory although i think the ending could have been strung out a little more with a runtime of only minutes i think there could have been something special in the final act it doesn t give a lot of information nor does it allude to the significance of the book we are reminded of it s importance but never fully understand we are told that it gives hope but never why or how that was really the only lacking portion of the film otherwise i thought the story was interesting though completely outdone by the animation i guess that s okay to a certain degree the animation can carry a film so far before it falls short the story lacks a few parts but it is an interesting take on a fascinating piece of history i would recommend looking up briefly the book of kells just to get an idea of what myself and this film are talking about i think it will help your viewing experience a lot more this a very impressive and beautifully illustrated film that should definitely not be missed
an american in paris is an integrated musical meaning that the songs and dances blend perfectly with the story the film was inspired by the orchestral composition by george gershwin the story of the film is interspersed with show stopping dance numbers choreographed by gene kelly and set to popular gershwin tunes songs and music include i got rhythm s wonderful and our love is here to stay it set a new standard for the subgenre known as the songbook musical with dozens of gershwin tunes buried in the underscore the climax is the american in paris ballet an minute dance featuring kelly and caron set to gershwin s an american in paris featuring an impressionistic period daydream in the style of various painters is one of the longest uninterrupted dance sequences of any hollywood film the ballet alone cost more than half a million dollars a staggering sum at the time it s funny to think of such a work of art being born over a pool game between film producer arthur freed singin in the rain wizard of oz on the town meet me in st louis and the band wagon and ira gershwin it was freed s idea to buy the title so he could use if in a film about paris and gershwin s idea that it would only use gershwin music original cast was to have cyd charisse but she discovered she was pregnant before shooting began a major reason gene kelly suggested leslie caron as the female lead was because he felt this movie needed a real french girl playing lise not just an american actress playing one gene kelly discovered leslie caron while vacationing in paris where he saw her perform in a ballet when she got the call to audition she said who s gene kelly according to leslie caron her introductory dance sequence which included a seductive dance with a chair was considered too suggestive by some censors gene kelly directed the brief fantasy dance sequences shown as lise is introduced vincente minnelli first wanted maurice chevalier in the georges gu tary part and celeste holm in the nina foch part minnelli was a groundbreaking director of musicals with meet me in st louis an american in paris and the band wagon he used color and songs in ways they hadn t been used before he used space and time imaginatively best of all though he allowed himself to cut loose for the long ballet sequences that end all his movies the ballet in an american in paris may be his best work even though vincente minnelli is credited as the sole director he was sometimes tied up with his divorce from judy garland and other directing projects leaving gene kelly to take over the directing duties other highlights include guetary s rendition of stairway to paradise oscar levant s fantasy of conducting and performing gershwin s concerto in f see why it was oscar levant s favorite the ballet sequence now that we know it was successful everybody now wants to take credit for it freed minnelli kelly but before the film was completed the new york office of mgm said no to spending a half million dollars on a ballet so freed went to studio head louis b mayer himself and got him to agree new york said no finally gene kelly showed the new york office how a british film the red shoes used a long ballet sequence and that film became a world wide hit and is still considered today the premium example of a successful art film well the financial guys finally gave in and signed the checks there was a break in production after november at which point gene kelly began rehearsing the ballet choreography by the time production for that final sequence resumed on december vincente minnelli had finished directing another film father s little dividend irene sharaff designed a style for each of the ballet sequence sets reflecting various french impressionist painters raoul dufy the place de la concorde edouard manet the flower market maurice utrillo a paris street henri rousseau the fair vincent van gogh the place de l opera and henri de toulouse lautrec the moulin rouge the backgrounds took six weeks to build with painters working nonstop roger ebert said after viewing the recent restoration an american in paris has many qualities not least its famous ballet production number with kelly and leslie caron symbolizing the entire story of their courtship in dance an american in paris is often compared to singin in the rain as to which it the greatest musical ever made and one critic put it best when he said singin in the rain makes me happy and an american in paris makes me feel good the ballet represents kelly s fantasies as depicted by the great french artists renoir rousseau lautrec dufy he admires arranging a screening for the then ailing raoul dufy the actor and producer ducked out until the end credits there relieved they found the artist moved to tears requesting a second helping of the sumptuous finale the film was also the first to win a golden globe award for best motion picture comedy or musical gene kelly received an honorary academy award that year for his versatility as an actor singer director and dancer and specifically for his brilliant achievements in the art of choreography on film it was his only oscar
this is an entertaining look at the gospel as presented by johnny cash adorned in black of course who sings a lot and narrates a bit also if you like johnny cash this film is quite enjoyable also note the blonde depiction of jesus in this work just for fun try to think of five jewish men who have blonde hair anyway its a fun presentation of the greatest and most important story of all
i had never seen richard thomas play a bad guy i wasn t sure i would like him this way and i wasn t sure he could pull it off but this astounded me he sent shivers up my spine and caused me to take a closer look at street people the movie is engrossing and fast paced bruce davison is convincing but all he can really play is a nice guy the real talent here is thomas the ending was a little clumsy but perhaps that s the way real people would fight if you are a thomas fan you must see him here at his best being bad
i quite enjoyed this movie for two reasons the first is that it gives an insight into the world of loyalism in northern ireland which is very rarely treated in movies most of which tell us about the republican struggle the second reason is the performances of the actors i thought they gave very honest and convincing portrayals of a very seedy underworld that not many people hear about outside my native shores all in all it is an entertaining ganster movie with stellar performances from a who s who in northern irish actors cast it wont move the earth although it may slightly open some peoples eyes to the murky world of loyalist paramilitaries
in watching how the two brothers interact and feed off of each other through the whole movie makes me personally happy to live in the rural area much like they did in the movie i have watched this movie countless times and have the book right beside my bible after watching the movie i agree that this is one of the few movies that does a book justice i strongly recommend anyone that has the chance to go to montana to fish or be outdoors to do so it is amazing i can not think of anyone else that could play the role better than brad pitt do yourself justice and watch one of the better movies in the modern movie era strongly recommend and as a guide for fishing trips in both montana and wyoming do not try to learn how to fly fish from the scenes of the movie because although it looks great on the film you have no idea how much practice and skill fishing like that actually takes thank you for listening watch this movie please if you would like a long sad movie
simple rules for dating my teenage daughter had an auspicious start the supremely talented tom shadyac was involved in the project this meant that the comedy would be nothing less of spectacular and that s exactly what happened the show remains one of the freshest funniest wittiest shows made in a very long time every line facial expression casting choice scene all wreaked of perfection there was not one episode after which i thought man that wasn t as good as the rest each one was a standout again this is the kind of perfectionism that we ve come to expect from tom for those who don t know tom shadyac is the director of ace ventura first movie the nutty professor first one and liar liar quite a r sum he s a producer here not a director but his magic touch is felt in every episode the family consists of the father paul hennessy john ritter nice slightly neurotic can be a pushover from time to time works as a sports writer john unfortunately passed away in leaving a fond memory and near sure cancellation contemplations by the suits the mother cate katey sagal come on who didn t fall in love with katey when she played peg on married with children al bundy was our hero we viewers gave him the respect and love he never had but without peg s nonchalant parasitic lazy lifestyle al would ve probably been just another chicago dad instead of the mess that peg life actually caused him to be katey was a milf back then and still is a brune now instead of a redhead and just as buxom as ever cate is the conservative mom and loving wife i know it sounds boring but comedically she fits perfectly the ditzy blonde daughter bridget played to perfection by kaley cuoco almost never has an idiot been played so well aside of gob on arrested development bridget may well be a shoe in for any awards given to this archetype bridget is shallow self centered not very bright and a tad slutty in his look she plays the dumb blonde role better than absolutely anyone imo perfection one of the high points of the show the overlooked geeky daughter kerry amy davidson a brune and a geek she gets no love from life or circumstances feels overlooked under appreciated and neglected most of the time she s bridget s younger sister in reality she s older than her and the two s extremely opposite personalities and brains cause endless clashes to much of our amusement the son rory martin spanjers was the second funniest character imo before the passing of ritter then john passes new characters come and rory is not the wise cracking verbal trouble maker that he used to that went mostly to david spade s character those characters were the main ones at the time of john ritter unfortunately enough the insanely hilarious larry miller one of my favorites did not get lots of screen time he played paul s co worker competitor after an aortic dissection cost ritter his life in september th the show was on hiatus for a while no one thought it could come back but it did later on with a couple of new additions this began the second phase of the show and the new characters were the strict confident school principal ed adam arkin i saw adam here and there on talk shows this was the first time that i saw him do anything impressed is the word i use his performance was very impressive sad he wasn t brought in earlier he also plays cate s potential love interest after paul passes the gradual progress towards this point which would ve sounded crazy at the beginning earns the creators lots of praise it was done slowly carefully and excellently with constant respect paid to the paul ritter the attitude grandpa jim egan james garner a surprisingly welcome addition to the series he was cannon fodder for endless old jokes mainly by the year old unemployed wise cracking half brother of the mom cj played to insanely funny heights by david spade i knew spade was funny i just didn t know he was this funny somehow spade s very familiar presence is sensed inside his character as opposed to a separable character which is understandable since he s a comic and he s on a comedy show this eerie feeling is kinda like seeing someone borrow lots of material from david spade s appearances in movies talk shows and functions award shows etc and delivering a superb impersonation of spade s voice and comedy style except that it is spade by that i mean you realize he s not trying to play someone else or a whole new character he s being the goofy funny spade we ve come to know and he takes this pleasantly humorous formula to the absolute top every line he uttered every sarcasm he begot all classics literally spade was crazy funny so so funny the show s humor and drama were both upped after the show was back but audiences thought john passed it ain t gonna be the same anymore this is understandable considering we are talking about a group of people american viewers who gave yes dear a free ride but caused andy richter controls the universe to be cancelled in no time as the show s quality increased its ratings declined soon it was no more sadly and i saved the best for last fans of married with children are in for a treat and boy what a treat it was i still shiver just remembering it it s a surprise so good that it would be crazy for me to spoil it even if i legitimately do it under the spoiler pretext suffice it to say that it s something you ll never forget i know i won t
the season finale sent mix messages i felt feelings of joy and also feelings of being lied to and deceived roseanne tells all her viewers that the entire season nine was a lie because her husband dan had died she also admits the family never won the lottery and what season was a lie just being how she wished or wanted it to be i m still confused about when she said becky ended up with david and darlene with mark because becky and mark admit to being pregnant so i believe that is just how she wanted it to be but it wasn t so the season finale was good but sent mixed feelings i will always be a fan of the show

i did not like chandni bar from the same director i did not watch his other movies they came and went but page is nicely made seems real like satya from rgv did the mental sickness of the so called high society is the summary of the movie in the midst of all the sickness its difficult to lead a normal life which the protagonist konkana sen does serious movie not to be watched with children or expecting wives page of newspapers is the usual place for reporting the activities going on in the parties of the rich and elite who indulge in much more filth then what is reported how this page is also a business prospect is shown in the movie event management firms get paid to arrange parties and make a rich but not famous people famous overnight by clicking photographs with the celebrities invited to the party the western culture has crept into the high society of mumabi quite deeply the movie shows it boldly no holds barred madhur bhandarkar starts a new journey from here
the only other film besides soylent green that has such an air of hopelessness is on the beach both films deal with the consequences for the species and the planet from man made cataclysms on the beach with nuclear war and soylent green with the environmental poisoning of the planet maybe there s cause for some optimism because as of we haven t reached either of the worlds described in those films and we were supposed to by now new york city still has about million people not the million by the turn of the millenia as described in soylent green environmentalists always hail this film as showing the consequence of global warming for myself it also shows the right to life ethic run amuck obviously there s no family planning in this world either charlton heston is an nypd detective who lives with room mate edward g robinson who s old enough to remember the earth before catastrophe struck there s been a murder committed joseph cotten an executive with the soylent corporation a multi national concern that has come up with a food product some kind of wafer in many colors to feed the world s population it s latest product is soylent green the investigation finds charlton heston getting his man but also it leads to some horrifying truths about the soylent corporation and the future of mankind as heston shouts in the end that soylent green is made of people that we ve become a race of cannibals the horrifying thing is that there is no alternative we ve exhausted the planet and we have to eat our dead to survive this was the farewell performance of edward g robinson and in his memoirs heston spoke movingly of robinson even though they had differing political views a few weeks after robinson wrapped that final scene of his screen demise by consented euthanasia he passed away in real life not many did but heston knew that robinson was terminally and there was no acting involved in that final death scene between the two of them though the timetable was off it doesn t mean that the world envisioned by soylent green may not come to pass hopefully we ll have not just the intelligence but the sense of shared responsibility to keep that from happening
this movie is one of the most provocative jesus movies i have ever seen it does not seek to tell the whole story but only to portray an interpretive expression of the last day of jesus christ it is darkly witty playful and seriously faithful to elements of the jewish tradition and to modern scriptural interpretation judas is much more ordinary than other portrayals not the dark and sinister evil that we sometimes imagine but a grossly mistaken man horribly misguided in his zeal chris saranden s jesus is playful and serious faithful and committed very human while also divine the final dialog is thoughtfully done and serves as the kind of small talk that two powerful men might do when they have just committed an atrocity i would watch this movie again and recommend it to others
it s a strange thing to see a film where some scenes work rather weakly if only in comparison to other films in its legacy and others in a sub plot or supporting story are surprisingly provocative and strong sudden impact is one of those cases where clint eastwood as star producer director shows when he can be at his best or at his lessor of times when dealing with a crime mystery detective story in his dirty harry fame we get that make my day line and un like in the first film where his do i feel lucky speech was playful and cool the first time and the second time at the end tough as nails here it s switched around he gets into another shamble with the department as usual when he tries to fight crime his way in particular with a diner robbery inspiration for pulp fiction and with a high speed pursuit with a senior citizen bus he s told to take a vacation and that s the last thing on his mind this whole main plot isn t very convincing aside from the expectancy of the story and lines which just adds to the frustration but soon his story merges with the sub plot that eastwood develops from the start enter sandra locke s character jennifer spencer whom we soon learn after some appropriately mysterious scenes that she and her shy sister were victims of a cruel unjust sexual assault err outright rape and is sleekly undercover like getting revenge her scenes and story are the strongest parts of the film the most intense and finally when it goes into callahan s storyline he s getting facts in the same small town she s in on a murder the film finally finds a focus between eastwood s classic form of clearly defined good vs evil though sometimes blurred to be sure eastwood films the flashbacks not to say too much about them expertly in a fresh experimental style the trademark lalo schifrin score is totally atmospheric in these scenes and in others it almost seems like a couple of times an art house sensibility has crept into eastwood s firmly straightforward storytelling style which helps make the film watchable it s a shame though that in the end it goes more for the expectable or maybe not expectable points and until the third act callahan doesn t have much to do except his usual it s smith wesson and me shtick however with locke he gets out of her a very good performance more subtle and touching than the one in the gauntlet and an exciting climax at an amusement park in a way i do and don t agree with ebert s remark that it s like a music video in eastwood s style here i admit there is comparisons with the simplicity of both the directness but the scenes where eastwood does break form are superior to those of any music video it s cheesy it s hard edged it s not up to par with the first two harry pictures but hey there could be worse ways to spend a couple hours with the master of the
although this was not without its faults this drama was a fitting one to be shown around easter time it reminded us of our spiritual selves and showed that behind our facades we often hide our deepest sufferings and experiences there was so much to enjoy in the drama not least the rapping teenagers who provided a better musical accompaniment to the drama than the rather poor sound score in the background the acting was excellent and timothy spall was once again superb the climax was very satisfying if rather simplistic timothy spall s letting go of his long dead wife s suicide was credible and mirrored well the feelings of despair that were present in the teenage girl who self harmed the resolution between the graffiti boy and the muslim was gratifying but less believable a wonderful drama which left myself and my husband felling that the evening had been well spent congratulations
first of all let me comment that the audience loved it from the first moment perhaps current events in the middle east led people to take the attitude i came for a comedy and by george i m going to enjoy it but for whatever reason everybody seemed really into the comedy of it the last few times woody has tried to do a straight comedy small time crooks curse of the jade scorpion hollywood ending i ve felt like the one liners felt strained and a bit antiquated i remember thinking at one point that would have been funny in the early sixties so going in to this movie i was afraid woody was becoming tone deaf however in this one his comic sensibilities were in perfect tune admittedly there were plenty of my fellow aarp card carrying folks in the screening but there were also plenty of somethings and somethings as well and they all seemed to get it and give up the occasional belly laugh in addition to numerous guffaws chuckles and the like in many instances the throw aways had people laughing so loud you missed the next line thematically woody was traipsing familiar ground as i suspected from the trailer this film had a lot of manhattan murder mystery in it but then again there was more than a smidgen of oedipus wrecks new york stories alice and even a little tribute to broadway danny rose at the very beginning even with woody in the movie scarlett as sondra was at times the woody proxy but her character was far from the nebbish that say will ferrell gave us in melinda and melinda or kenneth branaugh attempted in celebrity instead of archetypal ticks and quirks sondra s nerdishness comes directly from the family history which she shares early on on numerous occasions the family business leads her to malapropisms that we get as an audience while the characters on the screen can only perceive them as strange non sequiturs since we are all in on the joke we can t help but laugh but the laughs don t come from recognizing the woody nebbish but truly from the character to a great extent unlike farrell branaugh cusack or even mia farrow before her scarlett is not required to use the woody voice to evoke the woody role thus we don t find ourselves ripped out of the narrative as a woody s voice suddenly emerges from someone else face as my friend commented on the way out sid the character played by woody is a supporting role but more center stage than i was hoping going in however this time woody seems to have written a character that truly fits his current persona unlike his ed dobel sage character in anything else or his blind director in hollywood ending this time the character is a comfortable fit perhaps more importantly this time the character works in the story within the elevated circles they find themselves in he is even more fish out of water than scarlett which is used to great comedic effect throughout sid is a declining itinerant magician playing to small audiences but the fact that he is from another era is placed front and center for our enjoyment but what about jackman what about ian swearengen mcshane i liked both of them to the extent that they are used in the piece i particularly liked mcshane s short but effective turns jackman is charming with the ease of old money that was so often portrayed in films from years ago class echoes from purple rose of cairo so what did i think short answer maybe his best straight comedy since s bullets over broadway less stylized than mighty aphrodite less caustic than deconstructing harry less forced than small time crooks or hollywood ending woody has finally found a comic voice that works in the st century
philo vance had many affinities with bulldog drummond he was a gentleman with the kind of polish and elegance only usually associated with the british upper classes and he was also independently wealthy but there were vital differences drummond was an adventurer charming gallant lively vance could be pompous slight y dull and self righteous there was a hint of fundamental cruelty in his manner the kennel murder case is the most impressive of the vance films made between and the story of a murdered collector of chinoiserie it has all the ingredients of the classic private eye mystery exotic setting in the blue nose long island kennel club three killings for vance to solve including a baffling locked room murder the key to the whole affair and plenty of suspects usually a detective story setting have proved too static and talkative to make convincing movies even though they work well enough on the printed page but here michael curtiz s direction and the fine editing give the film a pace and urgency that make it altogether different from similar films of its type william powell s elegance and suavity made him the perfect vance and although a year later he switched studios he stayed in the same genre with the enormously successful and popular the thin man at mgm
i already loved how the grinch stole christmas when it was released and i m still loving it now years later still lots of people seem to disagree with my opinion and this movie never really had received much love at the time it came out sure the movie is over the top and campy but that at the very same is also the reason why this movie is so charming and fun to watch all of the sets costumes and characters are done perfectly over the top in a fun way without ever becoming truly ridicules it s a visually spectacular movie to watch it s a campy movie making at its very best director ron howard really surprises with this fun little christmas movie main reason why the movie works and why it s so much fun to watch is jim carrey as the grinch he truly carries the movie with his good and fun role he is of course helped by the convincing make up which also received an academy award of course if you re a jim carrey hater you shouldn t even think about watching this movie this movie is really his movie and he makes it all work and so much fun to watch other fun and memorable roles are being played by jeffrey tambor clint howard and josh ryan evans as the young grinch the movie has a good morale but it is all a bit sappy to me perhaps it s because i m dutch and we don t really celebrate christmas that enthusiastic and big here as in the united states or england for me the movie was simply fun and entertaining and the morale just left me quite cold to be honest the musical score by james horner is good and fun even though it s your average every day horner stuff it still all works perfectly for the movie and helps to make some of the scene s work perfect christmas entertainment
william powell s final outing as philo vance occurs in the kennel murder case where the murder of a championship show dog leads to two more murders and one attempt of the human kind it s all in the figuring out of how that leads to the who and why the philo vance murders by s s van dine were most popular at the time and the clever mr van dine figured out a way to sell his books one at a time to the highest studio bidder this is why you see so many philo vances and so many studios putting them out had bill powell not gone on to greater fame with mgm as nick charles of the thin man series he would have been known as the greatest of philo vances it turns out that powell had entered his little terrier captain in the same contest where the murdered dog was entered and then another rival owner became the first murder victim as usual powell shows up eugene palette as sergeant heath whose biggest contribution to the proceedings was using his bulk to break down the locked from the inside door where the first murder victim was found i did say locked from the inside and it was an upper story so it was in figuring out the how powell has a lovely group of suspects as extensive as what normally is in a thin man mystery people like paul cavanaugh helen vinson ralph morgan mary astor fill their cast roles well warner brothers liked this version so much that in fact they remade it again in the thirties with james stephenson in his one and only outing as philo vance it doesn t hold a candle to this one as this is the only powell philo vance that is out on vhs or dvd by all means see this one or acquire it if you can
this wonderful little film has all of the elements that made the spaghetti western so exciting and fun great music by one of the few if not the only female composer to work in the genre nora orlandi exciting action sequences and very vicious ones for the day and beautiful scenery and sets all in almeria spain of course it also has a very good story with a nice tragic romance edge to it the actors do marvelous jobs with truly standout performances from lawrence dobkin and rosalba neri in the most vital role for a female in a spaghetti western outside of cardinale in leone s once upon a time in the west without posting any spoilers let me just say that this movie contains one of the best endings of any film i have ever seen
it s hard to say sometimes why exactly a film is so effective from the moment i first came across the stone boy something told me it would be a great film in spite of that it seemed very unlikely that i d ever have the opportunity to actually see it for myself then one day while looking through the online catalogue of my local library i saw that they had recently purchased the dvd release of this film which i m extremely glad for because the cinematography is of a stunning depth and quality that an old vhs copy could never replicate and speaking of the cinematography i must single it out as far and above the most stunning aspect of this film as a photographer who pursues very nearly the exact visual style portrayed in the stone boy i m a firm believer in the fact that a great cinematographer can almost single handedly carry a film here he has a lot of help from an extremely talented cast and a director who understands perfectly what the story needs but to have juan ruiz anch a behind the camera makes virtually every scene something of beauty and you can almost never say that most films would never even expect such a thing of you scene after scene captures some detail some little bit of visual magic that takes your breath away the director christopher cain has had a long and interesting career as far as i can gather this film is not very representative of it but sometimes to catch a director near the beginnings of his career before all the big budgets and loss of focus there s a real subtle magic to be found cain steps back in this film lets things happen with a life of their own and then ever further much like early john sayles films characters are given space to breathe time to talk side stories happen because they do and that s how life is cain displays a remarkable raw even outright painful understanding of human nature in this film the acting ties much of this story together when people talk when they exist in this film they do so as actual people not held back by the fact that they are playing characters gina berriault s script allows immensely talented and respected actors like wilford brimley robert duvall glenn close and frederic forrest to spend time simply existing whether the things they have to say are minor or of deep significance it all comes down with the weight of pure reality when you look at the actors involved or the great soundtrack by james horner it seems strange that such a film be very nearly forgotten maybe much of what makes the stone boy what it is was the time period it was made in there s this s hangover feeling to this picture that reminds me deeply of my own childhood people talk of the s in terms of modern styles and music but that s not the s i lived in or remember the look of the images the understated and dark knowing quality of the acting and the overall result should get under the skin of any person who grew up in or near this era of time in north america i see myself in this i see how i saw the world and a film like the stone boy sees the world for how it truly is for more of this feeling please see the black stallion never cry wolf tender mercies testament places in the heart matewan high tide driving miss daisy the secret garden the secret of roan inish wendy and lucy
this movie is one of the best ever produced by disney the plot is very original and entertaining the animated sequence is also very well done with the live actors for the time perhaps one of my favorite sequences is contained in this movie with the march of the suits of armor
i decided to watch this because of the recommendations from this site i would have to say it was worth the effort however you should take heed that this film will go on for minutes if you don t have the staying power get it on tape and watch it over a couple of nights now to the film what i say will contain spoilers and if you don t mind here goes alexandre is a promiscuous bum a womanizer and a gigolo he lives with an older woman called marie marie owns a retail shop and she provides for alex alex spends his days at caf s and restaurants the story reveals that alex had previously impregnated gilberte whom he used to live with gilberte dumped him for a less attractive man that she did not love because alex had abused and battered her at this point alex was willing to get a job and and help raise their child before he found out gilberte had aborted it and planned to marry someone else by chance alexandre meets a nurse nymph called veronika and they striked up a relationship veronika fell in love with alex for the first time after all the sordid sex she had with men in the past marie and veronika struggles for alex s affection and had a m nage trois to boot finally at the end it s revealed veronika is pregnant with alex s child and alex asked her to marry him we assume as aforesaid with gilberte s situation alexandre will even get a job and be the provider for his new found love and family there is hope with the title of la maman et la putain i deduce jean eustache was relating to fran oise lebrun s character of veronika she was a whore and then she became the mother hence the mother and whore is the same person anyway what do i know french films are mostly not all very chatty aimlessly political preaching theatrical insipid lamenting and full of quotes lebrun and l aud played their obdurate characters well and held the film together as some part of the script became a little lost and disjointed not a bad effort
after seeing jeremy brett as sherlock holmes no actor should ever display such conceit as to imagine that he could ever come close to mr brett s portrayal of one of the most interesting characters in literature jeremy brett is sherlock holmes and in my opinion there can be no other the great actor basil rathbone is i must admit a close second but is still second one might make the argument that mr rathbone s screenplays were inferior to the absolutely top notch productions afforded mr brett and to this i would agree however when all is said and done jeremy brett will always and forever be the only actor to truly become sherlock holmes the book should be closed on this subject and we the public left to enjoy mr brett s unique performances bill rogers sonarman yahoo com
one of the first ova s original video animation i ever bought this still has to be one of my favourite anime titles a cyberpunk sci fi action comedy set against an unlikely for a comedy that is background of near future pollution in a dystopian society the heroes of dominion are the tank police formed with a if we can t beat crime we ll get bigger guns philosophy and who are like the name suggests patrolling the city in tanks instead of patrol cars and who are actually far more dangerous than any criminals they are trying to catch most if not all of these cops are borderline psychopaths and neurotics giving new meaning to the phrase loose cannons equally colourful and amusing are their adversaries terrorist buaku and his hench wo men the twin cat sisters whose existence always seems to involve giving the tank police a hard time the animation is not state of the art but it s very nice otherwise the colourful palette and cartoonish look of the characters and mecha fit nicely with the comedic atmosphere of dominion the english dubbing is again lots of fun the soundtrack of the english version is also very good i wonder if they ever made a soundtrack album of that anyway dominion tank police is great it s japanese cyberpunk sf with lots of comedy filled with completely over the top characters and situations making sure that it never takes itself seriously highly recommended
hint number one read the title as the time of the mad dog or perhaps dogs this is a pretty good ensemble piece look at the cast and rent it you know you re curious already and first time director bishop gives them their chance taking his time letting the characters interact and chew the scenery as they wait not enthusiastically for the return of the big boss and whatever revenge ensues for some of us the highlight is seeing christopher jones after his self imposed exile from films he remains a commanding film presence and yes with christopher jones larry bishop and richard pryor involved this is the wild in the streets reunion party
i picked up the movie with no cover and not even knowing what it was but when i watched it i laughed so hard it is now one of my favorite movies of all time rusty and the guys created a masterpiece i would highly recommend this movie to any one with a sense of humor thank you rusty for giving us something to laugh at
a classy offering from amicus producer milton subotsky and director peter duffell the far pavillions etc turn in a classy intelligent four hander with a strong cast peter cushing christopher lee jon pertwee ingrid pitt etc all giving stylish performances despite a low budget which results in a few un special effects the most outstanding contribution however is that of the year old chloe franks who turns in chillingly effective account of her part which makes one s blood run cold only spoilt by the lurid title wished on the film by its distributors this underrated release a cut above the run of the mill blood n guts shocker movie is for those who appreciate a little thought with their horror
the sweet is never as sweet without the sour this quote was essentially the theme for the movie in my opinion tom cruise plays a young man who was handed everything in his life he takes things for granted and it comes around full swing in this great movie with a superb twist this film will keep you engaged in the plot and unable to pause it to take a bathroom break its a movie that really makes you step back and look at your life and how you live it you cannot really appreciate the better things in life the sweet like love until you have experienced the bad the sour the theme will really get you to open your eyes only complaint is that the movie gets very twisted at points and is hard to really understand i think the end is perfect though i recommend you watch it and see for yourself
richard brooks the last hunt was a film star stewart granger couldn t even stand to hear mentioned he even tore up a vintage poster for the film when presented it for signing in his later years but then the director did run off with his wife so it s understandable for anyone else this is one of the best of the adult westerns of the s and years ahead of its time in its attitude to the environment in many ways it plays almost like a sequel to one of anthony mann s westerns that see their heroes dragged to their redemption kicking and screaming against it every step in the way here granger s legendary buffalo hunter has already seen the light but after a buffalo stampede costs him his herd of cattle in a fit of poetic justice he s dragged back into the darkness by robert taylor s callous and proudly racist gunslinger justifying it on the grounds that i ve already got the guilty conscience i might as well have the money as well raised by indians he s fully aware of the damage he s doing as the disappearing buffalo heads for extinction and he gradually becomes almost as consumed with self loathing as taylor is with hate when the two men fall out over debra paget s squaw the sole survivor of a band of indians taylor kills and a white buffalo hide that s priceless to the hunters and the indians for very different reasons a showdown becomes inevitable though the outcome certainly isn t taylor s is certainly ironic casting it was granger turning down many of the epic roles mgm developed for him in films like quo vadis and ivanhoe that gave taylor his s comeback after years of steady decline his hair color may not convince but his performance does a shallow and violent man so consumed with hate that he doesn t wear a gun the gun wears him granger s accent isn t always convincing but he makes a good quiet hero in the jimmy stewart mold trying to keep hold of his newfound decency and reconcile his actions with his beliefs before finally getting a chance to make amends russ tamblyn s halfbreed skinner and lloyd nolan s one legged old timer also give as good as they get but the real star is the script tightly plotted with an excellent eye and ear for character not to mention an ending stanley kubrick borrowed for the shining it balances historical revisionism with entertaining drama without ever selling either short the new french dvd is extras free but does boast a transfer with an english soundtrack
purple rain is a great film if you are a something music lover who partied to prince music in the s the story is a much used formula rising musical talent must overcome personal and professional hurdles to find his audience and self respect prince is a bad actor but his performance especially of purple rain i would die u make it worth sitting through the film he is himself and as a showman as powerful on stage as mick jagger or michael jackson circa thriller apollonia kotero a former prince prot g is beautiful and shows some acting talent and chemistry with prince but her script doesn t let her far morris day and other supporting actors provide comedic elements
this is right up at the top of my list of the most hysterically funny shows i ve ever seen i laughed so hard i m sure i missed half the jokes this showcases izzard as the brilliantly gifted comedian he is what i particularly like is that he seems never to be dumbing down the material for his audience his timing is impeccable and the routine is tied together as a performance piece rather than just a series of gags thumbs way up
i watched this movie after seeing it on broadway i love the broadway musical and i love the movie i watched the movie like it was not related to the broadway show i am an avid reader and have seen what happens to most books when they are turned into movies so i developed a philosophy really early assume that the movie is going to be based on the book or musical in this case but that while the story line may be similar it will not be the same it will be different so watch it for what it is i danced for years before i had to make a choice i was a good dancer picking up chorus work in local productions as a child etc but i wasn t super talented i was however super talented as a show rider i was told by my dance instructor and my trainer who i spent several months a year at his farm out of state that i had to make a choice when i turned that i needed to move up from dancing two hours four five days a week and riding hours a day days a week and dedicate to one or the other so i dearly love dancing and i love this movie and a lot of the other ballet and dance movies i just chose to watch this movie for what it is it is a great movie about raw emotion and human interaction it is about the power of anticipation and heartbreak when you work really hard to get something you want and you just do not get it i love the movie i love the broadway musical
today if someone mentions the name victor mclaglen the response most likely will be who or perhaps why well believe it or not victor mclaglen won the academy award for best actor in this film which is about a poor desperate man who is willing to sell out his best friend for carfare to the united states it s an interesting movie which shows how low even the most well meaning shnooks will go just for a few bucks the movie takes place in british dominated ireland and while all the other characters are either directly or indirectly fighting for the political independence of ireland all mr mclaglen s character is concerned about is getting money and getting drunk the movie makes one wonder whether political activism is worth all the trouble because while the activist is struggling to make a point many others not only do not care they don t even know what the fuss is all about the morale of this movie is look out for the friend he may sell you out for a dime
homicide the movie proved to be a good wrap up to a well written well directed and well acted series loose ends were tied up that weren t properly addressed at the end of the final season the entire series and especially the movie provided a life like look at life and death in baltimore a culturally unique city with an extremely high murder rate my attraction to the series began long before i moved to baltimore but once i experienced life here for myself i realized how realistic it was and the movie certainly retained that spirit i will certainly miss new original episodes of the series but am very grateful to nbc and the producers and cast for giving us one last glimpse at the dark side of charm city
this is a great movie it has a captivating story an awesome main character very good acting and killer action this takes place mostly in the year but shows scenes that take place in past years to explain the story the story is very well done and there are no holes kurt russell is a solider named todd who is trained from birth to kill and like all of the other soldiers have never had normal lives eventually the military introduces newer younger faster and stronger soldiers jason scott lee being one of them as a result they don t have any need for the old soldiers like todd they test out the new soldiers by having them fight some of the old soldiers in the battle russell is injured and assumed to be dead the military dumps his body as well as a fewer others assuming they are all dead but what they don t realize is that russell is alive todd finds a camp filled with civilization on this planet that the military dumped him on for a while he lives there but can t adjust to normal life he rarely says a word and he is at times very aggressive towards the other people when they feel he is a danger to them they send him off to the desert just as russell s leaving the planet is attacked by the new soldiers what the military forgot was to train the soldiers to be smart like todd and the other old soldiers so while these new soldiers are faster and stronger than todd todd easily outsmarts them the military starts realizing this and todd kills all of their men but one that one is jason scott lee and in the end you see a classic fight scene between russell and scott lee russell obviously comes out on top this is one of the best action films i ve ever seen and i ve seen a lot this has everything you could ask for in a film including some great lines the writer also didn t forget that russell had never seen a woman before as he calls even women sir there are no holes in this film every minute has a purpose and it s very entertaining an awesome one man army action film for fans of rambo commando and missing in action this is highly recommended for all kurt russell fans and action sci fi fans
in the aftermath of watergate a number of conspiracy movies appeared such as this one written by the late adam kennedy based on his novel gene hackman plays ex vietnam veteran roy tucker a loser who has wound up in prison he receives visits from marvin tagge richard widmark who claims to represent an organisation designed to assist the wrongly convicted they offer him freedom and despite distrusting tagge he accepts but he brings along a fellow cell mate by the name of spiventa mickey rooney exactly why is hard to see as spiventa is an irritating little man who drives tucker mad with persistent talk of sex not what you want to hear when you are behind bars tagge s benefactors kill spiventa before tucker s astonished eyes reunited with wife ellie candice bergen and given a new identity strangely he does not attempt to change his appearance shaving off that cheesy moustache would have been a start he settles down but finds there is a catch tagge wants tucker to do no less than assassinate the president of the united states he refuses so tagge has ellie abducted i will leave the synopsis here but i am sure you can guess the rest for yourself the script has enough plot holes to make you want to read the book neat trick that the people tagge represents are never revealed the allusions to j f k s killing are unmistakable despite the findings of the warren commission the doubt as to whether lee harvey oswald acted alone persists to this day this was stanley kramer s first movie in years and while no turkey it lacks the grip of say john frankenheimer s the manchurian candidate or alan j pakula s the parallax view being a left wing conspiracy movie it tends to skirt around its subject matter instead of getting to grips with it i prefer right wing ones myself they are funnier domino has the look and feel of a made for t v movie and boasts what must be the easiest prison escape in movie history not to mention an ending copped from the michael caine classic get carter what makes it watchable are gene hackman and richard widmark the latter who sadly passed away earlier this year is superb as the mysterious tagge who initially appears to be behind the operation until he too is ruthlessly eliminated beginning a chain of deaths designed to remove all trace of evidence as one by one the perpetrators of this evil plot fall just like dominoes as tucker the innocent pawn hackman is marvellous you have to wonder though why he chose to hide out in such an obvious place in his shoes i d have fled to the other side of the world anywhere to get away from these fanatics hackman s love scenes with bergen slow the plot down and it is almost a relief when she gets snatched presumably the producers thought so too which explains why it opens with a bizarre prologue setting out the film s entire premise voiced by british actor patrick allen warning the audience that they are out there and that they are out to get us comedian les dawson later spoofed this opening in his b b c show the dawson watch mickey rooney had earlier worked with kramer on its a mad mad mad mad mad world his death scene here resembles like an outtake from that picture with the actor looking as though he has been stung by a wasp rather than shot dead conspiracy movies used to be only made by the left but now the right are getting in on the act too last year taking liberties an absurd concoction of lies and half truths about tony blair s government turned out to be britain s answer to reefer madness at least domino had lovely candice bergen the best chris atkins film could offer was anne widdecombe surprisingly the domino principle was made by sir lew grade the legendary british television mogul behind the saint jesus of nazareth and the muppet show he worked with adam kennedy again in on raise the titanic whose failure was so great it sank grade s ambitions of being the new louis b meyer being somewhat open minded i would not rule out the possibility of a conspiracy
while there aren t any talking animals big lavish song production numbers or villians with half white half black hair it does have thing realistic people acting normally in a strange circumstance and walt roy did in their eras with the studio if you thought think the castaways or the island at the top of the world weren t identical or you hold them to a higher authority than atlantis then your idealism is just as whacked as keeping your kids up till midnight to watch a friggin cartoon
the thief of bagdad is impressive in the shape of the evil magician jaffar conrad veidt he plots with lies and magic spells to obtain the kingdom from its rightful ruler the young king ahmad and a gorgeous princess from her father he falls victim in the end as all tyrants do in books and legends to love and of the common man whom he ignored here embodied by the little thief sabu the armies of good and evil black and white are superbly realized in both visual and literary terms the script is poetic simply and very beautiful the costumes of the magician and his men rising and falling like the wings of black birds attacking suddenly in the night to inflict destruction and create terror the radiant hero wears white turbans and robes and his princess is dressed in pinks and pale blues for spectacular scenes it matched all that had gone before while through its use of color it brought to life a world such as had not seemed possible before with flying carpet and flying white horse with a giant genie excellently played by rex ingram with evil wizards and with the good acting of sabu and veidt the thief of bagdad captures the quality and true atmosphere of the arabian nights the version remains the screen s finest fairy tale
while the title before the devil knows you re dead comes from an irish proverb the film plays out like a greek tragedy it all starts with a botched robbery and continues to spiral out of control as two brothers attempt to escape the mess they ve gotten themselves into the cast is well assembled with philip seymour hoffman ethan hawke playing the aforementioned brothers notable support includes albert finney as their father and marisa tomei as the wife of one brother and lover of the other beyond these principals the acting is unremarkable the story is compelling and is told with a certain degree of verve the narrative structure keeps things interesting by providing different points of view and frequent time shifts that being said the film s unpredictability is somewhat muted since it becomes apparent early on that this story is a tragedy through and through all in all a pretty impressive debut for first time screenwriter kelly masterson sidney lumet s direction is well handled but i m more impressed by the fact that he s still directing at over eighty years old i was less impressed by the score by carter burwell but it isn t a major distraction in the end the film proves to be compelling viewing and while the story presentation may have superficial similarities to other films this one remains a unique experience
i am and was very entertained by the movie it was my all time favorite movie of being raised in the s i was so in love with kris kristoffersons look and demeanor of course i am no movie critic but for the time era i think it was very good i very much like the combo of streisand and kristofferson i thought they worked very well together i have seen the movie many times and still love the two of them as esther and john norman i am a very huge fan of kris and see him in concert when i can what a talented singer song writer not to mention actor i have seen him in many movies but still think back to a star is born
i waited a while to post a review of this documentary because when i first saw it over years ago i wanted to think carefully about what i wanted to write i found from a documentary standpoint that this is a darned good documentary it did what it set out to do show me something i had no idea about and kept me interested in this world it explored i knew nothing of the drag world and finding out about them and the balls was just spectacular to me these folks were just so talented with what they do and how they do it for competition the catty folks the complainers even i was angry when someone told the judge that the coat the drag queen was wearing wasn t a man s coat the jealous it s all there like in every other competition like every other competition like it which i felt was a point you had the older drag queen talking about how the balls used to be compared to the newer drag queens who have changed the balls and made more competition categories and even those who looked on knowing that the future of balls would change even more when they were ready to walk the runway it was interesting to hear that some of the contestants were living out on the street two minutes before the ball but came to compete it was that important to them then there was sad stories stories of who s house and house mother brought out the best and the brightest in competition it was interesting now to add after years of seeing this film i lived through the so called madonna craze i spotted a few familiar faces from this documentary who ended up with madonna during her vogue phase and rightfully so if not for those individuals madonna wouldn t have had a vogue phase i know that now credit should be given where credit is due makes me wonder if anyone else from mainstream america would watch this documentary they ll learn they re not as mainstream as they think
the music of albeniz pervades this film once and a while it is played with original instrumentation e g piano but never full orchestra but often it is re worked with various contemporary ensembles e g guitar and treatments e g jazz piano only occasionally is the music the sole focus of the film the vast majority of the time the music is set to various dances often flamenco but not always i would guess that there are scenes which are not united by a plot not all scenes will reach the heights for an individual viewer in my case about half reached the pinnacle though all the rest were in their own way very fine those that worked for me moved me to goose flesh aesthetic delight indeed the final scene left me weepy with joy and in some very magical way it brings you deep into spanish culture if you don t like subtitles don t worry the film is virtually wordless though each scene carries a title of an albeniz piece seeing this very beautiful film sharpens my complaint that virtually none of the films of saura are available on dvd in the usa i am thinking here particularly of his flamenco version of carmen a spectacular work of art that is available in europe but not here european dvd s won t play on american dvd players this is a scandal
having never seen the original dirty harry i judged this movie on a clean slate and i must say i quite enjoyed it sure some of the acting by sondre locke made me a little squeemish but hey it was the s but even if you can t get past her and i almost couldn t or her revenge killings which seemed a little overdone p it s worth it just for dirty harry or at the very least the bull dog he affectionately names meathead p
cute idea salesgirl linda smith yolande donlan inherits a teeny tiny little county of lampidorra that country which wasn t even in north america was made the th state of course there were only states at the time since this was made in linda travels to the country she has inherited and we follow her along as she tries to figure out what to do with this strange country and its even quirkier people at one point she sings a song that she claims is from her people the navajo and it gets ever more sillier from there although yolande donlan s heavy lipstick and omni present smile never get ruffled or shmeared there are other songs scattered through out as the citizens sing to welcome their new princess filmed in a glorious british version of technicolor or some such equivalent about the only big name here is dirk bogarde as british subject tony craig cheese vendor bogarde made a big splash in the uk film industry after serving in the war and was even knighted by qe ii craig and the new princess keep bumping into each other and their adventures become more intertwined as lampidorra s financial problems worsen fun little farce along the lines of marx brothers film also note that donlan later married val guest the writer and director of our little project and stayed married for years guest was better known for writing and directing his sci fi flicks in both the uk the us
after having seen a lot of greek movies i feel very suspicious against most of them but after watching this i felt astonished the movies is great without a big try you cannot claim that the screenplay is so great or the photography is perfect or something technical it s a real story and it is happening in greek rural areas in places forgotten from god the movie is like a punch in the stomach and i would really wish that things are not like this it obviously talks about the xenophobia of the greek people the ignorance to anything different the problem of this guy is not that he is an ex convicted the problem is that he is not one of these people he is different and they do not want them that s why all the good things he is doing turn boomerang to him and also speaks about the apathy of the people because there are some people who are against the hunting of the king but they do not dare to say their opinion in the end you can clearly see the hypocrisy of the society being religious and trying to act like god says but at the same time acting so unfairly to the king this shows how easily people rationalize their feelings or their beliefs according to the established system in the end you can have a positive lesson from this very bad story meaning that you can understand and be part of this society only if you want to become one of them if you want to remain different and even alone you are lost and it is not far from reality i think it is tragic that the story is real and this should be a bell for everybody no comment for the main actor because he is already given an award and i believe that his play was great small comment for hatzisavvas plays the policeman he is like a dinosaur he has played a lot of roles and i m sure that this role for him was very easy but he plays it so great that you cannot deny him a big bravo i definitely recommend this movie to anybody who wants to see a good greek movie
when i first heard about this movie i thought it would be like the duchess but when i saw the first minutes of the young victoria i knew this wouldn t just be a solid movie almost everything in this movie is great the costumes are really amazing and the settings are also beautifully shot the only thing that really let me down are the performances emily blunt the devil wears prada is the star of the film bringing victoria to life and with this movie she shows that she is a great actress and maybe picking a first oscar nomination for her performance rupert friend is almost bland as prince albert but he has great chemistry with emily blunt paul bettany is also solid as lord melbourne although i expected more of him jim broadbent and miranda richardson both have supporting roles but are forgettable to me the film feels like unfinished maybe that the screenwriters changed too many things in the script i don t know but that s how i feel about the movie but overall it s a great movie about the early years of victoria with a great performance from emily blunt
originally conceived as a solo vehicle for dudley moore not only but also saw his ex beyond the fringe collaborator peter cook guest on the first show and so well received was it the controller of b b c insisted that he be on it every week from then on they were a classic comedy team cook was tall handsome and witty while dudley was short charismatic and musically gifted the sketch that brought the house down had them in a pub wearing flat caps and mufflers fantasising about movie stars such as jane russell and greta garbo it remains one of the most hilarious skits of all time and even when cook corpses it still holds together well those characters idiot pete and even bigger idiot dud found their way into every episode of the show proper seen in a different setting such as a zoo or an art gallery in the latter they munched sandwiches while discussing works of art that leonardo davinci cartoon i don t see the joke says dud pete points out that when it was first unveiled it probably had people in fits dud nearly chokes on his repast you really are enjoying those sandwiches ad libs cook the pair bounced their humour off each other in a way that was joyous to behold the sketches themselves set new standards for comedy standards that would not be matched until the arrival of monty python as the show s popularity increased so did the quality of the guest stars peter sellers for instance and john lennon the latter presenting a filmed item based on his poem deaf ted danoota me one leg too few had dud as george spigott a name later re used in the film bedazzled a one legged man who hops into the office of film producer cook to audition for the role of tarzan cook tries to let him down as best as he can i ve nothing against your right leg he says the trouble is neither have you dud would on occasion interview the eccentric sir arthur streeb greebling cook who when he was not teaching ravens to fly underwater was planning on opening a restaurant called the frog the peach another classic was the leaping nuns also reused in bedazzled but my all time favourite has to be superthunderstingcar a wickedly funny and accurate parody of gerry and sylvia anderson s thunderbirds pete and dud played all the roles with the latter making a fetching lady penelope ludwig had ludwig van beethoven as the star of a this is tom jones style variety show the immortal bargo was a spoof documentary on the life of reclusive movie star emma bargo in an unforgettable moment she drove through london bellowing through a loudhailer i want to be alone a season feature was poets cornered with the likes of ronnie barker spike milligan barry humphries willie rushton and others suspended over a gunge tank they each had to improvise the line of a poem and anyone failing to make it rhyme wound up in the nasty stuff three seasons were made in all produced at different times by joe mcgrath dick clement and jimmy gilbert sadly very few editions survive to make matters worse the scripts were destroyed as well it beggars belief that this situation was allowed to happen the show ended in the comics then hit broadway made the infamous derek clive tapes but cook s ever increasing alcoholism broke them apart eight years later cook announced that a new series was in the offing but it turned out to be wishful thinking on his part his ex partner was making films in america and had no intention of working with cook again not at that time anyway enough footage was scraped together for a season of b b c repeats in the early s as expected some items had not held up as well as others cook died in and by way of a tribute the b b c put together a programme compiled from various parkinson interviews and not only but also shows it ended rather appropriately with pete and dud finding themselves in heaven bloody hell exclaimed the latter moore passed on in
putting the ufo thing aside this was the best documentary i ve seen factual reporting by neil and buzz a must see the interviews and reporting are a revelation since most of the information was stamped confidential in and only released in no documentary to date has the detail or accuracy for such a brief minutes the facts will blow you away and you will be left in awe of the risks taken to be the first on the moon neil and buzz are probably the biggest hero s of our time ever see a man save his own life bet not neil saves his life when only mili seconds separated him from death amazing to watch it is a travesty people have not known all the details assosiated with landing on the moon and the courage those men had when facing certain death from a failing computer stars
a must for any punk rocker this is the movie that made the ramones a household name back in the early s when it first appeared on premium cable stations this was one of the first and best of the american punk rock movies with a cult classic status up there with the rocky horror picture show originally the producers wanted cheap trick as the stars but the release of the live at budakon album had just made them superstars and too hot an item to be in a low budget movie very good luck for the ramones who were looking to break out of the underground punk rock world and into the mainstream market which sadly never happened until after the bands demise the band dee dee especially always disliked the movie through the s but the fans always loved and could recite most of the movie while waiting to get into ramones shows this movie like most classics is stupid fun with some classic ramones footage in their heyday don t expect more you won t find it it s great fun so enjoy it another allan arkush classic movie in a similar vein is get crazy featuring lee ving from the legendary hardcore punk band fear
a sweet funny story of people crossing paths as they prepare for their weddings the ex cop writer and the public school teacher fall for each other in this great new york setting even though they are marrying other people maybe a little trite in that the partners are both type a personalities while our protagonists are much more relaxed not anything heavy but it made me smile and hey for the guys sell the natasha henstridge angle and the gals sell them the sappy romance everyone wins

yes this movie is predictable and definitely not award material but then it doesn t try to be anything it is not a fun filled romp with real funny one liners a stellar and very funny performance by peter o toole a grounding and down to earth performance from joan plowright the band s performance was on the spot each one playing their role in a deft comical manner the music was good though not great but filled out the movie nicely from some of the negative comments i deduced that the subtlety of some of the humour went over their heads a good example is the comment about the strange baseball like game well my dear american that was cricket from which baseball is derived and the explaining of it to the ignorant us band was very funny for those that do know cricket also no you were not supposed to wince when carl broke a window it was funny how lord foxley said oh yes to get more money for breakage and the manager said at the same time oh no also referring to the money jeez it seems that every joke must be explained to some people all in all i enjoyed it and had some great laughs well worth seeing
i thought this was an excellent and very honest portrayal of paralysis and racism this movie never panders to the audience and never gets predictable the acting was top notch and the movie reminded me of one flew over the cuckoo s nest
this comedy still sparkles thanks to the combined efforts of writer director steve gordon and stars dudley moore and john gielgud sadly gordon only in his early forties died soon after completing this his only feature film it s an especially unfortunate loss since he shows a truly deft hand at character driven farce that makes the whole film irresistible it plays almost like a s style screwball comedy revamped for contemporary tastes the plot centers on arthur bach a drunken diminutive millionaire playboy who is at risk of losing his million inheritance if he doesn t marry the dowdy and boring susan johnson an heiress handpicked by his old money father and dotty grandmother of course he doesn t love her and by chance runs into linda marolla a working class waitress and of course aspiring actress after she pilfers a bergdorf goodman tie for her father the standard complications ensue but in a most endearing way with loads of alcohol fueled slapstick executed with classic lan by moore that he makes such a spoiled character likable is a credit not only to his comic talents but to gielgud s feisty acidic turn as hobson arthur s devoted but reality grounded valet it s the type of role he could play in his sleep but gielgud makes hobson such a truly memorable character that his fate in the film brings a welcome injection of poignancy in the proceedings in probably her most likable film role liza minnelli hands the picture to her male co stars by toning down her usual razzle dazzle personality and making linda quite genuine in motivation a pre la law jill eikenberry plays susan just at the right passive aggressive note while barney martin jerry s dad on seinfeld steals all his scenes as linda s slovenly father ralph the one fly in the ointment is veteran actress geraldine fitzgerald who overdoes the eccentricities of the grandmother and i have to admit that i still can t stand the very dated overplayed christopher cross song that inevitably won the oscar for that year s best song unfortunately the dvd certainly in need of remastering has no extras worth noting except some photos and production notes
this movie was an impressive one my first experience with a foreign film it was neither too long nor too complex i myself enjoyed the subtitles and the plot was surprisingly fresh the story of an adult son visiting his elderly father and retarded brother after a long separation appeared cliched at first but it proved to be very touching and realistic there was also some subtle humor so as not to depress or bore the audience
titanic is a classic i was really surprised that this movie didn t have a solid ten overall in the imdb user rankings maybe it s just cool to not give titanic credit nowadays but when it was first made it was really something when the movie came out people flocked to the theaters when it came out on video my sister and i would watch it twice a day for a month it was safe to say we were obsessed and for good reason some of the disaster scenes were hard to forgot like the frozen baby or the guy who committed suicide after killing someone in the unruly crowd many people died on that ship and to convey that on film with the immediacy and emotion it needed is a hard challenge that james cameron stepped up to and let s not forget the amazing romance between jack and rose whether or not their relationship was a figment of someone s imagination it was lovely they barely knew each other but they would die for each other they trusted each other they sure as hell are giving romeo and juliet a run for their money i ll never let go jack titanic is a great film down to it s very core it is a powerful story told through brilliant acting excellent cinematography beautiful music and a crew full of hard and dedicated workers it really blows my mind when someone says they hate this movie
the first side story in the universal century gundam universe presents a refreshing new look at the war between earth and the space colonies the focus is no longer on a small group of individuals who would go on to play pivotal roles in the conflict but on the everyday civilian population and how the war is seen through their eyes the story does contain some gundam staples its premise being the attempts by a zeon squad to capture an experimental gundam but it the execution of the plot that made this show so interesting to watch this series focuses on the experiences of a young boy named alfred and the relationship between his neighbor christina mckenzie who is secretly a federation pilot and a newbie zeon pilot named bernie wiseman alfred develops a sort of brotherly love for bernie while our young zeon pilot also falls for christina war in the pocket proves that you do not need a sweeping epic tale about special individuals to make for a good war story there are no uber ace pilots or large scale fleet battles to be seen here this short episode ova focuses a lot more on character emotional drama over other themes like politics or philosophy and i love how realistically portrayed the characters are alfred is your typical everyday kid who plays violent computer games and thinks the armed forces is cool he is then given a crash course in the horrible realities of war the unlikely friendship and bonding between bernie and christina each not knowing the fact that they are soldiers on different sides of the war is played very real without going overboard with the romance drama stuff same goes for the endearing relationship between alfred and bernie that being said i would not want to spoil much of the story here but it makes it a whole lot more heart wrenching to watch the tragedies that unfold as the show moves along all the way to its emotionally devastating twist ending despite its lack of action this show never falls into the category of boring the characters are just that engaging enough to carry the whole show not to worry as there are a number of mobile suit action scenes scattered here and there each are beautifully animated on a level that surpasses that of an ova and are sure to satisfy the craving for some mandatory mobile suit battles in a gundam series normally watching anime in japanese or english i would leave up to personal preference but in this case i strongly recommend the english voice track over the japanese one not only do the characters whom all except alfred are caucasian sound more believable in english but the performances of the english voice cast are on par and even surpass the japanese one instilling each character with such realistic emotions and intonations that they sound just the acting in some live action tv dramas in short this show does not try to impress the audience what it does is conveys numerous heartwarming themes that hit closest to home especially the death of innocence on the battlefield and the horrors of war through the eyes of a child a truly moving little story that deserves more credit than it is being given
but just as entertaining and random love it or hate it but don t expect a sophisticated plot or nail biting cliffhanger think of it like seinfeld but without the follow through and repeat performances of wacky characters well so far i have a feeling i will develop favourites as the season continues creature comforts is not for the faint of humour it s meant to be enjoyed with the least amount of effort on your brain s part which is why this show embodies everything i need in a program when i get home from work in the evening superficial conversation in the background with just the right amount of cute to the characters for me to enjoy when i eventually look up from the computer to see what i m missing funnier than most of today s sitcoms calmer than an evening at nascar just the right mix of dead air and comebacks can t wait for the next one
ok this one s a weirdy honestly i can t tell you all the inner plot points of the beast cuz i started losing interest when nothing happened during the first or more minutes but just wait it definitely does pick up the plot involves something about a monster in the woods that some french aristocrat chick screwed back in the day eventually you see the beast which looks like a guy dressed in a giant rat bear costume with a horse cock attached to it the scene takes place with the aristocrat woman running around the forest looking for a lost sheep the sheep ends up dead and the woman gets scared the beast pops up rapes the chick and shoots gallons of spunk all over her eventually the chick starts to enjoy the beast s attention which results in some pretty novel simulated sex scenes including an unnervingly erotic foot masturbation scene where the woman jerks the beast off with her feet while the monster shoots more huge loads everywhere yeah i ve got a twisted foot fetish so sue me the whole film is told in flashbacks and long winded dialog scenes that tended to be a bit tedious a shocking but predictable ending concludes this extremely strange film the beast is a film that i find kind of hard to rate the cinematography itself is quite eye catching and the sets costumes and locations are elaborate the plot is a little convoluted and seems to take it self awfully seriously for what ends up being such an unintentionally hilarious film about a chick boning a rat bear a good bit of tits ass and hairy s french bushes to help make up for the dull first half of the film i have to honestly say that if it weren t for the graphic scenes of the beast spackling all over the willing maiden this film would have been a real bore that is unless you like dull dialog and some graphic horse sex the beginning has a very up close and personal scene of two horses boning including a pulsating and spunk covered female horse vagina yum but the beast sex scene is so strange and such a refreshing change from the rest of the film that i have to say that those scenes alone make up for what otherwise would have been a real snoozer i have to recommend this one to anyone who thinks they ve seen it all the beast rape really is out there and something to be witnessed also recommended to any fans of s s sleaze films this one ranks pretty high with them worth a look for you sick rat bear beastiality lovers out there like me
loosely based on the james j corbett biography the roar of the crowd gentleman jim is a wonderfully breezy picture that perfectly encapsulates not only the rise of the pugilistic prancer that was corbett but also the wind of change as regards the sport of boxing circa the s the story follows corbett a perfectly casted errol flynn from his humble beginnings as a bank teller in san fransico thru to a chance fight with an ex boxing champion that eventually leads to him fighting the fearsome heavyweight champion of the world john l sullivan beefcake personified delightfully by ward bond not all the fights are in the ring tho and it s all the spin off vignettes in corbett s life that makes this a grand entertaining picture there are class issues to overcome here perfectly played out as fellow club members pay to have him knocked down a peg or two and corbett has to not only fight to get respect from his so called peers but he must also overcome his ego as it grows as briskly as his reputation does along with the quite wonderful corbett family and all their stoic humorous support corbett s journey is as enthralling as it is joyous yet as brash and as bold as he is he is a very likable character and it s a character that befits the tagged moniker he got of gentleman jim the film never sags for one moment and it s a testament to director raoul walsh that although we are eagerly awaiting the final fight the outer ring goings on are keeping us firmly entertained not even the love interest sub plot hurts this picture thank you alexis smith the fight sequences stand up really well and they perfectly show just how corbett became the champ he was his brand of dancing rings round slugger fighters is now firmly placed in boxing history as the final reel rolls we all come down to earth as an after fight meeting between sullivan and corbett puts all the brutality into context and it s here where humility and humbleness becomes the outright winner and as far as this viewer goes it will do for me to be sure to be sure for a truly wonderful picture
another comedy about a plucky little country struggling through the jungle of the modern for the forties global world with only native wit and pluck to guide them this is a fine entry in the ealing cannon terry thomas sparkles as usual in the lead as a feckless ministry man led to the brink of disaster when a nation he is supposedly in charge of starts attracting the interest of the world ian bannen makes a great romantic lead peter sellers puts in one of his quieter performances as a corrupt politico and the uber suave john le mesurier plays against type as a rugged revolutionary leader lots of fun is had by all especially the viewer perhaps not in the very top echelon of ealing classics but pretty high up
i remember watching the disney version and watching it now makes me think it has somehow lost its magic touch plenty of other renditions ever after put aside of cinderella have in fact lost their touch throughout the years then i found this production with a flawless performance by kathleen turner as the evil stepmother and was blown away by the phantasmagorical essence of this fantasy story that has cast me under its spell since childhood we all know the story of cinderella a young girl who s father died and was dominated by her wicked stepmother and stepdaughters and longs to go to the ball for one last chance for freedom but this plot line takes a different twist in the classic fairy tale by causing cinderella whose real name is zizola and is only called cinderella by her family because of her slavery to be trapped in a situation of her father who still lives slowly losing himself to a dominant wife who manipulates him into playing favorites with his wife and step daughters against his own and tries to poison him thus zizola goes out to save her father by stopping her stepmother from finding another suitor at the ball by distracting the men who come her way there the bored prince valiant has a change of heart from his dull life and falls in love with the mysterious lady in the strange dress forged by a water nymph named mab with rose petals for slippers what drew me to this film most of all was it s original take on the old fairy tale that none can compare to it does not weave a web of lies like most cinderella stories it does not ignore any reason as to why cinderella would want to attend the ball and nor does it show a shallow side to the prince as the disney version did instead it shows more of cinderella s selfless heart more than any other production and the artwork is simply stunning the costumes are all beautifully made especially zizola s sapphire blue ballgown to match the marcella plunkett s fantastical beauty and soft spirit like voice i would highly suggest this film for anyone who is interested in a dream like sequence of the classic fairy tale with an interesting twist my only problem is that the producers and director did not make a full collection of other fairy tales with this same element and the fact that the film is now out of print
i haven t seen the original incredible journey since i was a child so i can t really compare the two versions this version tells the story of three animals two dogs and a cat whose owners leave them with friends in the countryside when the father of the family has to take a new job in san francisco the pets believing that they have been abandoned escape and set out on a long homeward journey through wilderness this story might have been most easily filmed as a cartoon but both versions are in fact live action films made using real animals one major difference is that in the later version the animals speak in human voices giving each its own distinct personality something that was not done in the original film a similar device of talking animals has been used in other recent children s films such as racing stripes some critics have been rather sniffy about the use of this device but my own view is that giving the animals distinctive personalities of their own helps to strengthen the film rather than weaken it the animals were voiced by big name stars don ameche michael j fox and sally fields both dogs are male and their relationship parallels that between many humans in buddy buddy movies shadow a golden retriever is the wise experienced older dog chance the younger one is brash cocky and impulsive to british eyes chance looks like a boxer but is actually an american bulldog which is apparently a different breed to its british cousin sassy the cat is female with a rather prim and proper personality she is very proud of her status as a cat which in her eyes makes her vastly superior to any mere dog cats rule dogs drool from an adult viewpoint the film has a number of faults it can be sentimental some of the incidents such as the one in which the animals manage to catapult a mountain lion into the river are quite incredible and the human characters are all completely forgettable this however is a film which is mainly aimed at children and i suspect they will enjoy it immensely certainly any animal loving child will do so comments by some professional critics such as james berardinelli who complained that the animals voices lessened the film s grandeur only serve to strengthen my view that professional critics are not always the best guides to children s movies i doubt if many playground conversations about homeward bound concentrated on its supposed grandeur one thing adults will appreciate is the photography of california s sierra nevada mountains they may also appreciate the film s blend of humour and excitement as the runaway pets encounter perils such as bears mountain lions and porcupines in the wilderness this is a very enjoyable family film
it s a very good movie not only for the fans of lady death comics but also for those who like animated movies series of adventure and fantasy the film is about a innocent girl who is about killed for something she hadn t done but for be who she is daughter of the ruler of hell lucifer himself then she seeks revenge and the rest you better see it from the movie i liked the movie a lot the characters are like the original comics form chaos i never had the chance of read the the first parts of the story in comics only the last ones after the passages in the movie so i cannot tell you if the events are exactly like the comics but one way or another it s the story of lady death
not that much things happen in this movie but a lot of meanings the woman thought she had all that she can in life but that was indeed not true and she found out herself when she met this person who was conducting some research for his next job there really should be more types of movies like this im not even that old as considered mature im by the way and i still got the idea and point of the film the main point is in my opinion don t think you can t have a better life just because you currently have this one though i got to admit i was thinking of watching another movie but after reading all the reviews and seen the trailer i decided on this one even though i knew not that much action would appear in the film i recommend anyone to watch this movie as it has very good points in the film and is a really good ending
it s so rare to find a literary work adequately translated to the screen that i may have rated this film higher than it deserves but not by much as a long time student of vonnegut s works i have no hesitation in recommending the film to his readers at least to those that love him as i do the casting is inspired nolte is understated in triumph bewildered in defeat decisive in judgment sheryl lee is luscious throughout but her handling of the treacherous resi and her tragic crescendo almost makes you forget her beauty alan arkin delivers a totally lovable but equally treacherous soviet spy do not feel you have to read mother night to appreciate the film though if you haven t read mother night you will probably want to after viewing the film notice the shifts from color to black and white and back again and don t miss the final symbolism of campbell s noose watch also for kurt vonnegut s cameo near the end of the film bing crosby s white christmas will never sound the same i write in mid december when the song is getting heavy radio play and it s driving me nuts
the opening flourishes left me purring with delight at their inventiveness the altered version of the archers logo the introductory disclaimer the way the camera pans over the cosmos it s strange to think that it s a wonderful life came out in the same year no great coincidence the s was awash with heaven and earth films but the glowing cotton wool nebulas and cutesy angels of the competition look tattered something best passed over in silence when placed next to alfred junge s vision it continues to look great all the way through as more and more striking ideas are sprung upon us i m not a great fan of mixing colour with black and white in general one of the two visual schemes almost always looks ugly when placed next to the other not so here powell dissolves colour into monochrome and monochrome into colour as if it s the most natural thing in the world a mere change of palettes both the colour photography and the black and white could stand on their own as for the story this may be pressburger s best script or at least it would have been had the conclusion been a more logical outcome of preceding events other than that it s tight yet with more going on than i can possibly allude to here was the heavenly stuff real or imaginary or both perhaps carter dreamt up a fantasy that was as it so happened true everyone says we re meant to neither ask nor answer this question but i don t see why i m sure we are meant to ask the question the film even gives us clues as to what the answer is indeed the problem is that there are too many clues and they seem at first to be pointing in different directions the fact that other things ought to occupy our attention as well doesn t mean that this shouldn t occupy us as well there is as i ve said before a lot going on consider the scene in which abraham farlan heaven s prosecuting lawyer plays a radio broadcast of a cricket match and contemptuously says the voice of england dr reeves the defence acknowledges the exhibit with a great deal of embarrassment and then produces one of his own a blues song from america which farlan listens to as though he s got a lemon in his mouth reeves looks smug snobbery well i don t see why it s snobbish to condemn blues music and that s not what powell and pressburger are doing anyway as the song is being played we get a shot of the american soldiers listening to it several of them nod their heads to the rhythm perfectly at home they don t find it incomprehensible there s something valuable about the song and neither reeves nor farlan knows what it is reeves probably realises as much all english audiences and all australian indian etc audiences as well know without being told that there is something of value in the cricket broadcast too and that while reeves understands that he is unable to explain it to farlan hence the blues broadcast which shows that people can understand each other without sharing an understanding of everything else it s a clever scene one last thing i found david niven a bit cold without the charisma he would acquire later in his career but even so i don t think a film has grabbed my heart quite so quickly after the action began as this one did
this series was a cut above the rest of the tv detective series of the day but somehow didn t find an audience the idea of a blind detective may not be totally new but added so much to the story and who could forget pax the beautiful guide dog in the series whilst the stories themselves may have been no better than the average series the settings in new orleans the acting and the music i note the comment about the music score in other comments i remember that clearly all work to make a good television series even better well you never know one day paramount might just dig into its archives and release it on dvd
i just watched this movie on showtime quite by accident actually if i wouldn t have only had hrs of sleep for the past two days then i wouldn t have came home early from work if i hadn t came home early from work i wouldn t have seen this movie i wouldn t have known what i was missing but i would ve missed a lot that s the way this movie is it s almost playing on the kevin bacon effect that and causality hence my verbiage above ever character is intertwined in some way or another action reaction interaction non interaction this movie is just wonderful i m going to have to find a copy to buy
i adored this movie not only because i am a big fan of moritz bleibtreu although he is in practically all german movies that count but also because he is not the main actor the lead is taken over by barnaby metschurat who was the only reason to watch s julietta and who really carries this movie on his shoulders a family moves from italy to germany seeking the german dream this is my own invention and ironic of cheap labor in steel and coal industries however they end up opening a restaurant and the journey the movie takes to this point alone is so poetic and at the same time funny and charming from this point onward the story told is mainly that of the two brothers of this family giancarlo bleibtreu and gigi metschurat gigi s dream to become a filmmaker is threatened by rivalry with his brother and his mother s determination to return to italy what follows is a great and totally neutral look at what life can become formed by the choices you make in the end this movie doesn t say which life gigi s or giancarlo s was more successful or fuller or more interesting it merely gives us a rewarding glimpse at what it must be like to search for identity when two countries and mentalities are involved and this look is not driven by bitterness or disdain to either country which makes it such a great film for any and every country dealing with the tensions resulting from immigration the fact that director fatih akin s moved to germany from turkey in the s also lends this movie a large measure of its credibility and emotional accuracy the icing on the cake are fantastic performances by the entire cast especially metschurat and this i really need to stress the little boy who plays young gigi that kid s performance would be a hard act to follow by just about anyone great movie go see it
it s true that you always remember what you were doing at a point when disaster or tragedy strikes and none more so that september a date which changed the entire global landscape in its fight against terrorism no this documentary didn t set out to be dwelling on the events leading to rather the filmmakers brothers g d on and jules naudet set out to do a documentary on the trials and tribulations of a rookie new york firefighter they had gone to the academy and done some shoots of training and had handpicked their proby probation firefighter to join them in an ny firehouse home to ladder and engine but their production was to develop and contain at that time believed to be the only shot of the first plane slamming into the world trace center i was traveling back with a friend on the train from a night of lan gaming and received a call at about pm local time from my dad who informed me of the above few minutes later he told me there was another and that the wtc was under attack by the time i arrived home the upper floors of the twin towers were ablaze and in smoke and to my horror they collapsed under an hour the filmmakers had two cameras running that day one who had followed a team out on a routine call and which immediately raced to the wtc upon hearing and seeing the plane crash into it we follow what is possible the only filmed sequence of events in the lobby of wtc where the first responders of firefighters paramedics and police had to make sense of what happened and to quickly develop a plan of action the other camera held by the other brother was making his way to wtc to look for his sibling and along the journey captured the many expressions of new yorkers as well as the sense of chaos in and around manhatten peppered throughout the documentary are numerous interviews with the men from ladder and engine which miraculously did not suffer any casualty but being survivors also brought about its own set of psychological turmoil as they struggle to come to terms with the event through the events that unfold we learn of the strong camaraderie amongst these men who risk live and limb each day on their jobs to save lives we began with what the documentary was supposed to be before events of the day totally swung in and became the focus right up to the rescue phase where hopes of finding survivors under the rubble were kept alive by the men who work round the clock in making sense of the collapsed steel structures it s not a film that is fabricated and what you see here cannot be recreated in any other documentary and heavens not sound stages for hollywood blockbusters it s as close as you can get to that day witnessing the event up close from safety code dvd contains a separate extra hour of sets of interviews with the men of ladder and engine
ooverall the movie was fairly good a good action plot with a fair amount of explosions and fight scenes but chuck norris did hardly anything except for disarm the bomb and shoot a few characters the movie was very similar to the events of sept with a bin laden like terrorist sending a video to the president urich and threatening to detonate it judson mills had some superb action roles taking out rashid s compound and various kick butt roles but there was a lack of chuck norris judson took over most of the action leaving joshua chuck with que on her computer but overall it was realistic and didn t lack the action but only did it on mr norris part i gave the film
some of my favorite laurel and hardy films have very very little plot instead they give them a rather mundane situation and just let them be hilarious films such as help mates and busy bodies are among the funniest as you see the boys working or cleaning house here in dirty work most of the film is akin to these other two films stan and ollie are chimney sweeps and spend most of the film trying quite unsuccessfully to clean a crazy professor s chimney seeing ollie fall through the chimney the boys making the house a total mess and the insane behaviors of stanley all work together to make a very pleasing film however in an odd twist there is also a really weird subplot that begins and ends the movie it seems that the professor is truly a mad scientist and he is working on a formula to make things younger late in the film you see him make a duck into a duckling and even a duckling into an egg given that he then leaves the boys alone in the room is it any surprise what happens next while this subplot was unnecessary it worked well enough what worked exceptionally well was the middle portion give the boys nothing exciting to do and you ll be amazed at the hilarious results one of the team s better films and it almost earns a
this is a great story of family loyalty which thankfully doesn t resort to the usual tricks or at least the ones i m used to seeing in american and european films of supersentimentality or high dramatic tension it s very watchable and very lovable it has some beautiful cinematography but doesn t rely on that alone to entertain
the college girl murders is my first acquaintance with the writing work of edgar wallace and generally my first real acquaintance with krimi films in general and i can say that i m moderately impressed this stuff is really entertaining although i never would have expected it to be so goofy the film has an exhilarating and nicely convoluted plot with a healthy dose of humor flamboyant twists and pretty inventive killings there s some james bond type of evil mastermind who always sits in the shadow and in front of a large monitor recruiting prisoners to kill certain girls at a specific college with a new type of poison there s also a villainous monk with a whip dressed like a communist kkk member getting rid of the leftover characters like overly curious teachers and such as well as a kooky police commissioner who persists on solving the case with a psychological approach seriously if i had known sooner that these krimi films were so colorful and crazy i would have purchased a whole collection of them already the pretzel plot actually raises more questions than it answers in the end and the overload of comical gimmicks on the account of scotland yard inspector higgins are sometimes a bit much to swallow but i don t care because it was sublime entertainment even the funky s soundtrack remained stuck in my head for a long time it s like a variant on the italian giallo but with slapstick elements
this is a film about life the triumph over adversity and the wonders of the human spirit i defy anyone not to shed a tear by the end of the movie this is more than just a tear jerker its an engaging thought provoking drama with excellent performances from all the cast but especially derek luke and denzel washington years on i m amazed that luke is still a virtual unknown and washington only directed one other film nevertheless apart from a slow build up the story of this foster child s trials and tribulations and how it still affects him in adulthood is the sort of movie that stays with you long after you have seen it like many fox searchlight pictures this was more of a sleeper hit and didn t get the mass critical acclaim it deserves the scene where antwone finally meets his mother summed up the movie for me there were so many ways that could have been done and it could have been all schmaltzy or it could have been unrealistic but washington struck exactly the right tone his mother never said a word and could only shed a tear while antowne asked simply why her overwhelming guilt prevented her from saying anything what could she say to defend herself one of the most moving cinematic scenes i have seen
being a giant monster fan me seeing yeti was an absolute must especially after hearing so much about it thanks to the good ol bootleg market i was able to find a copy pretty easily and was happily surprised upon watching that this flick was actually dare i say decent decent for what it is actually namely a cheesy giant monster flick it kicks in pretty quickly as yeti is found pretty much immediately and we get introduced to various characters they consist of some sleazy ones some good ones and a girl who is pretty much one of the most downright strikingly beautiful girls in any cheesy sci fi film by far yeti looks like a long haired guy straight out of the original woodstock concert and really he s not that bad of a dude especially after being introduced to the world in some kind of funky cage like thing godzilla he is not despite his rude awakening he doesn t even rampage actually he rarely destroys anything in the whole picture but kinda just looks puzzled while trying to figure things out yeti seems to understand english pretty nicely my copy was dubbed in english and he knows who the good guys and bad guys are however we want to see the giant yeti do his thing and he s pretty much in the whole movie and in typical low budget fashion he seems to change size a lot depending on the scene and there s even a bunch of the fake legs shots of him just standing there yes the special effects aren t the greatest but there are definitely some good ones here a scene where yeti smashes through a warehouse is done very well and in another he uses the windows of a building as ladder steps to climb down from the top of it shattering each window with his foot and often shocking the occupants inside in one sequence that really looks much much better than it should in such a bad movie yeti never stoops as low as say a p e does actually the only time it even comes close to genuine silliness is when the beautiful girl causes yeti s nipple to become erect and he lifts his eyebrow in an oh yeah baby manner but even this isn t that bad and kinda even gets a laugh out of the viewer the movie is pretty long for this kind of thing but surprisingly enough it doesn t get boring the story is actually good and just watching this utterly gorgeous actress on screen will make any male viewer happy yeti may not be in the upper echelon of giant monster flicks but it is definitely better than other king kong rip offs like a p e and queen kong by very far
when the chamberlain family is camping near ayers rock australia lindy chamberlain meryl streep sees her baby being dragged out of their tent by a dingo and then begins an ordeal that no one should have to experience for it seems like the dingo story is not believed by the public or the press and the whole thing turns into a circus lindy doesn t help matters either because she won t play to the jury or courtroom she s only herself and she s a tough nut to crack so of course everyone thinks she s guilty because there s a piece of evidence that hasn t come to light sam neill is excellent as michael chamberlain a seventh day adventist pastor who has doubts about his faith and perhaps about his wife it s good or bad to see that people are just as prejudiced and stupid elsewhere as they are in the states too because the australian public doesn t believe the story and the media only fans the flames eventually lindy is found guilty and sent to prison for a life of hard labor but years later a missing piece of evidence shows up and she s freed but not until after the family s life is basically ruined a heart breaking story very well done a bit long but well worth seeing out of
when i heard about this movie it was supposed to be the funniest thing i ve ever seen yes it was funny i mean i liked it all until the end where oh no i can t tell u should it for yourself it is funny except the vulgar language that s why i say if u like movies that r funny in sexual ways watch it but if not don t waist ur money on renting it or buying it
to be honest i didn t like that much this movie when i saw it for the first time but i guess the trouble is that i haven t seen it in a theater big mistake because the thing to see in cliffhanger is the settings and is the cinematography try to see this movie on the largest tv possible and a great sound system the music is good and puts the movie to a higher level and a commercial potential the more i see it the more i like it it s definitely one of renny harlin s best movie this guy knows about action die hard the long kiss good bye etc and it s particularly good in this movie the special effect are great and spectacular stallone really needed that movie get back with success still good to see him
well executed old and very dark house horror good set up which includes the character of poe himself alluding to the story in a london pub although from here it is pretty much the one guy who has taken the dare to visit the house on a particular night running from room to room either looking for or avoiding people it is still most enjoyable plus we have the delightful and enigmatic barbara steele there is some wooden dialogue and some unexplained bits and bobs but it is the super creepy atmosphere that is maintained throughout that and the super musical score that keep this one moving nicely along dvd originates from us and has a few extras
so every year there is at least one movie that hasn t got any chance of being a box office success because from the moment of production even before one simple shot is filmed everybody s picking on this movie there is a long list of these kind of movies and in the end some are really bad battlefield earth some may have their flaws but are quite enjoyable catwoman elektra and then there are a few which actually are really great for what they are but no one admits i mean my gosh just because the wide crowd does have to have a victim each year they can pick on not everybody has to join them so yeaaah maybe those movies aren t perfect but c mon how many movies are not every movie is supposed to be a new the lord of the rings not everybody will enjoy these movies but i bet there are more than who admit they do hudson hawk who is just hysterical funny color of night which may not be oscar worthy but is definitely a not dumb at all thriller with some nice twists swept away which i thought is a great mix of sick humor and a beautiful romance gigli which was great entertainment with some really memorable lines and not badly acted at all from the former bennifer couple and this year it s basic instinct well when i heard the rumors of a sequel to one of my favorite movies i was very sceptically and although i really love sharon stone i stayed sceptically until i ve finally seen this movie and really i was very positively surprised i can t understand why it gets such a bad press and such a bad voting here it never simply copies the original it has a quite clever story has tension action humor and the absolutely stunning sharon stone reprising the role of her life with years when shooting the movie she looks hotter than many stars in their s but it s more than her being beautiful it s brilliantly acted with all her looks her famous smile the way she speaks and moves from the very first frame she s in you can t take your eyes off of her it s simply a pleasure to watch her as catherine tramell and all of the other actors deliver solid performances too so i really can t see what s wrong with this movie it has a dark thrilling sexy and gritty look strong performances and you never felt bored maybe the story isn t oscar caliber but it never even tries to be it s an entertainment movie and by this standard it absolutely delivers in my opinion so give it a try
steven spielberg at had already directed two superb episodes of a series called the psychiatrist starring roy thinnes one episode had been about an emotionally troubled year old boy and the other was about a vibrant young man clu gulager in his best performance who is dying of cancer both episodes were stunning visually unlike anything else on tv and emotionally complex and adult the creators of the psychiatrist were richard levinson and william link who created columbo and also produced its first season peter falk insisted on first rank experienced tv directors for the first season of columbo like bernard kowalski and jack smight but falk agreed to spielberg after watching part of the clu gulagher episode of the psychiatrist spielberg says on the dvd of duel that he loved steven bochco s murder by the book script based on a levinson link story and he tried to make the production look like a million dollar feature even thought he had a lot less money to work with this episode of columbo is far more visually stylish and makes better use of the sound track and background music than almost any other columbo episode even though the series always used top directors spielberg manages to keep the great falk and cassidy from hamming it up too much but both actors are still a lot of fun spielberg also gets fine supporting work from martin milner rosemary forsyth and barbara colby all the performances have a freshness and vitality about them the only columbo episode that was close to being as well directed is the by dawn s early light episode with patrick mcgoohan directed by harvey hart i think the two episodes of the psychiatrist and this episode of columbo suggest spielberg hasn t developed technically all that much as a director he was great from the beginning in a combat dvd commentary of a episode guest starring albert salmi robert altman says that episode was pretty much as good as he ever got as a director maybe the same is true of spielberg
as other reviewers have noted this is an unjustly neglected depression era film directed by frank borzage two oscars and written by jo swerling leave her to heaven the westerner lifeboat etc it is a tough minded well structured and realized move about denizens of a new york city shantytown they re grifters beggars and women forced into prostitution but they re a community of people both good and bad with loyalties as complex as any group s perhaps primary among this movie s many admirable qualities is the contrast between spencer tracy s character bill and loretta young s trina he tough talking physically aggressive and evidently fearless but bill is not the character who gives this film its steely sense of survival while he blusters trina actually hangs tough if that term can be applied to a character so ladylike her devotion to him is obvious and complete when she becomes pregnant she says she will raise it herself if he wants to leave or i ll even give up the kid if you ll only be happy such is the dignity of loretta young s performance at age as a quite simple character that she seems neither weak or dependent but rather a woman who recognizes happiness when she finds it and wants nothing more
spoilers i was blown away by this movie i ve been renting on movielink for a bit and decided to check this movie out alot of boxing movies seem to overblow the blood in this movie it shows it at the amature level though i do wish that perhaps more attention would have been brought to perhaps her improving her grades the movie points out the problems some families face with gender i was a bit concerned with the ending but the ending wasn t a disappointment either i think it was pretty clear by the title that she d win what was unexpected was that the two of them got back together sort of at the end loved the score for some of the scenes highly recommended quality entertainment replayable
omar epps is an outstanding actor i really think he gets into his character alot when deja gets shot he shows true emotion he also shows true emotion when remmi puts the gun to him in the room omar is a very talented actor

babyface notorious barbara stanwyck flick where she is told by the local professor type that she has power he tries to get her to read nietzche she says books ain t never done her no good soon we find out her father is basically pimping her out to a local politico and others finally she has had enough and relocates to the big city we follow her trail of men up the ladder of success in an international bank the dialogue is quite saucy for it s time and it was one the last films to come out before the self inflicted hollywood production code look for a cameo by a young john wayne as one of stanwyck s willing victims part of the forbidden hollywood collection i watched the extended version the dvd has both versions plus red headed woman and waterloo bridge an interesting movie and foreshadowing for future femme fatale roles that stanwyck would play in the era of film noir b
i noticed that a new hope and the empire strikes back are in the top but that this one isn t even in the top this movie has a bad reputation because of ewoks but there are so many reasons to love this movie the rescue of han solo from jabba this official wraps up the han solo in debt sub plot that was established when we first met the character in a new hope the emperor was finally revealled well alright this might not work as well now that the prequels are out but this was the first time we saw the emperor as kids the speeder bike chase alright so this was a special effects moment but it was definitely one of the most memorable and exciting moments in all the films the part climax the battle of endor led by han and leia luke confronts his father the fall of the emperor the destruction of the second death star lando s moment the final celebration with our heroes like i said this movie gets a lot of crap because of the ewoks but i think it s kind of cool that while the entire galaxy celebrates the fall of the empire our heroes are having their own private party in the woods with each other all in all this was a great final chapter for our heroes and a fitting end to the star wars story
not being a fan of first person shooters i was very hesitant to play this game after having played the demo however i was sold undying really manages to pull you in the game and be part of the universe that your character is in you have this green amulet called the gel ziabar stone that has special powers and warns you of particular events or things to look at with a special spell the scrye you can see certain things that otherwise would be invisible to you walking in a hallway you suddenly hear the magical stone whisper look with the stone glowing at for example a painting and then using the scrye spell you can see some weird and creepy stuff on the painting let me tell you to witness something like that is scary as hell people who expect to finish this game in a few hours can forget about that even with the use of cheats this game relies on the character using wits and walking carefully around because like in any horror movie your surroundings are usually pretty dark and ghosts and monster appear at random when you don t expect them and can kill you very quickly there is this one scene where you want to enter a room where you are pushed back with such great force that it takes moments for you to realize what happened this was a scene that could have come straight out of the horror classic evil dead to experience something like this is a real accomplishment there are a lot of elements that take undying to the level of the best classic horror movies ever produced but sadly i have to report that there are some flaws for one thing the universe you are playing in is huge you start out in a big mansion with all sorts of hidden secret rooms and even a hidden hell dimension called oneiros that is all fine in the beginning but with all the loading times and some difficult enemies in between that can become frustrating and there is no map the game demands you memorize your surroundings so patience is required also there are some jumping puzzles that you have to do otherwise you can t progress i don t mind jumping on platforms in third person adventures but in first person mode that can be an annoying task luckily you can save at anytime and anyplace and trust me you will need it overall undying is an extraordinary first person shooter that deserves to be played by any horror or game fan
this a casper the friendly ghost short from my childhood and i re watch it on youtube thank god for you tube after that i love this short and it is one of my favorite casper shorts i love how the short starts off spooky with frank gallop s haunting narration until we get to see casper sitting by his tombstone in the cemetery reading while every ghost rose from the graves to boo people casper decides to leave in search for a friend but in trying to make a friend anyone who sees casper runs away poor casper sat on a log and weep until a little fox cub comes up an nuzzles him casper and the little fox quickly bond and he quickly names the cub ferdie and considers him to be his very best friend casper and ferdie s relationship is put in tremendous jeopardy however when casper is not keeping a close eye on ferdie while they are playing a game of hide and seek while ferdie is hiding a hunter and two of his hunting dogs come and try to kill little ferdie and ferdie is running as fast as possible until he is out of breath and starts panting while the hunter is firing gunshots towards ferdie casper notices they are trying to kill him and flies in the hunter s direction and pleads that the hunter leaves ferdie alone and the hunter and dogs are terrified of casper casper yells to ferdie that the hunter and the dogs are gone and that everything is fine but casper sees ferdie s body is not moving and asks if he is ok when casper sees ferdie has died he starts mourning in pain because he lost the only friend he ever had in his whole life casper returns back to the cemetery where he has buried ferdie and has made a gravestone for him next to casper s gravestone casper continues mourning in pain until he sees that ferdie has resurrected as a ghost himself ferdie starts licking casper on his cheek casper screams for joy because he has been reunited with ferdie overall it is a really good short though surprisingly disturbing showing death in a family oriented cartoon
in this satire of the commercialization and lightheartedness of war john cusack plays brand hauser an assassin sent to to turaqistan to take out omar sharif who is doing some oil business that will spell trouble for the former vice president of the us s own company in addition to this hauser must juggle his fake position as a trade show producer a wedding for pop princess yonica hillary duff and a nosy liberal journalist natalie marisa tomei assessing the technical aspects the acting by the main characters at least was good as was to be expected some of john cusack s dialogue was quite obviously not written for him as he often seemed uncomfortable saying it maybe unrealistic is more accurate joan put forth a great and often hilarious performance marisa tomei while i ve never been a big fan of hers was more than suitable for the role and worked well hillary duff however was pretty terrible they needed an attractive middle eastern or russian or whatever that accent was supposed to be pop star unfortunately they went for with her like i said above the writing seemed a little stiff and mismatched at points especially john cusack s dialogue not much of it mind but some the story also got a bit ludicrous at points which is fine for a satire to a point but it took it to a whole new level here luckily the cusacks and tomei keep a relatively cool calm demeanor throughout and that makes a nice even mix of the craziness of the film and the levelheadedness of the actors joshua seftel who previously had a drought of real credits to his name did a fine job with a rather wide spectrum film he handled the small million budget very well stretching it to make it appear to be much more seftel also managed to nicely blend the humour of the story with the painful and hard to watch parts of the real war including slaughter of civilians etc as far as the general satire goes its exaggerated look on the commercializing of war is very well done especially the golden palace poker ads on the u s tanks at points it becomes a little too much but in the end it still accurate portrays what it s going for an a young mel brooks type of style overall the film is very well made for the meager budget and it s definitely worthy of a look it won t go down as one of the great satires of cinema but it s certainly not the worst
i am shocked shocked and dismayed that the of you imdb users who voted before me have not given this film a rating of higher than that s a c if i could give fobh a i d gladly do it this film ranks high atop the pantheon of modern comedy alongside half baked and mallrats as one of the most hilarious films of all time if you know anything about rap music you must see this if you know nothing about rap music learn something and then see this comparisons to spinal tap fail to appreciate the inspired genius of this unique film if you liked bob roberts you ll love this watch it and vote it a
i found this film to funny from the start john waters use of characters reminded of some of the down to earth characters from fellini films christina ricci has once again expanded her abilities in this film if you are looking for a fun movie without preaching i recommend this film
as with most rosalind russell movies this one is very entertaining it s fun all the way through it s definitely one of the last of this genre of film just good wholesome entertainment give it a try i don t think you will be disappointed
this is one of those movies that i ve seen so many times that i can quote most of it some of the lines in this movie are just unbeatable i particularly enjoy watching him stumble and fall while drunk go out to the fancy restaurant drunk and the part with the moose i don t know how many times i have seen this sequence but it s funny every time from the moment arthur gets to susan s dad s place to the bit with the moose you pretty much laugh the whole time i remember watching the out takes regarding the bit with the moose it went down just like i d imagined it d be like they were all laughing so hard it was difficult for them to film it the late sir john gielgud was a wonderful addition to this his demeanor his one liners and the way he handled arthur were all equally hilarious it s always a funny moment when he whacks him over the head with his hat or tells him he s a spoiled little i laugh every time i listen to the i m going to have a bath and the lines that follow
this is one of my favorite comedies ever not wanting to condone the uninspiring lifestyle of its hero but taken for what it s worth and not as trivializing alcoholism the movie is simply a lot of fun it tells the unlikely tale of a perpetually drunk irresponsible something bachelor named arthur who is set to inherit a vast fortune but only if he marries susan chosen because the family thinks she might make something of him arthur proposes but then unwisely falls for linda a waitress and petty thief dudley moore is perfect as arthur the world s most endearing drunk whose antics are a laugh a minute admittedly moore is arthur and i agree with those who can imagine no other actor in the role the ladies of the piece are also well portrayed liza minnelli sparkles as linda and her on screen chemistry with moore is great jill clayburgh plays susan the wealthy and more appropriate woman chosen for arthur however this film is literally made by sir john gielgud who portrays arthur s sarcastic but moral butler hobson it s obvious these two have had a great mutual affection during hobson s longtime employment hobson is arthur s best friend and purveyor of unsolicited commentary and advice the most interesting relationship in this film is not arthur s romance at all but his unusual rapport with this witty and of course perpetually disapproving servant it s the butler you ll remember best long after the closing credits roll
in frank sinatra s first three films he was purely a speciality act ostensibly playing himself he merely shows up to croon a song during a nightclub sequence in somebody else s movie in his fourth film the very enjoyable higher and higher young blue eyes transitions into an acting career by playing an actual role a task made easier because he s playing himself in a fictional story that gives him a chance to croon a few numbers sinatra s entrance is quite funny michele morgan hears a knock at the door and asks who s there from outside a hoboken toned voice answers frank sinatra sure enough the opening credits of higher and higher may confuse some viewers as the names of songwriters rodgers and hart are prominently displayed in fact they only contributed one song to this musical disgustingly rich which this cast manage to toss off as a sort of intro to an entirely different song i m a debutante interestingly that rodgers hart song one of their weakest is perhaps the least enjoyable song in this movie s score several others are lively up tempo numbers notably it s a most important affair when it comes to love you re on your own and i saw you first sinatra s good in this movie but he would do better work and sing better material elsewhere the real merits of higher and higher are the delightful turns by some performers who rarely made films paul and grace hartman were an extremely popular husband wife dance team who starred in several broadway revues genuinely graceful ballroom dancers they put plenty of physical comedy into their dance material here grace does a high kick that knocks a shoe out of paul s hands grace hartman who died of cancer at age did almost no film work so it s a real pleasure that this film gives us a rare chance to see her close up to hear her beautiful singing voice and to notice how sexy she looks in her maid s uniform after grace hartman s death her husband had a long career as a character actor just occasionally dancing solo or alongside ken berry in one memorable episode of mayberry rfd also quite attractive in a maid s uniform here in higher and higher is the vivacious teenage singer marcy mcguire why didn t this talented girl make more movies perhaps she was just a bit too similar in personality to betty hutton i enjoy hutton s performances but i like marcy mcguire even better near the end of higher and higher there s an amusing bit of physical business featuring mcguire and mary wickes as waitresses taking it in turns to move from table to table in a nightclub the alternating strides of short mcguire and tall gawky wickes are hilarious regrettably although leon errol plays a large role in higher and higher he is given almost no comedy business not once does he do his famous rubber legged dance jack haley despite his prominent billing is also wasted very well represented here is dooley wilson inevitably remembered as sam from casablanca in that film wilson did his own singing but faked his keyboard performance of as time goes by in real life wilson couldn t play piano here in higher and higher he sings pleasingly and gives some amusing reactions to the other players less enjoyable is mel odious i mean mel torme victor borge gives a rare film performance here handling his dialogue deftly but never doing any of the keyboard comedy which he later did successfully in his stage shows the plot forget it higher and higher is nobody s idea of a great musical but it s an enjoyable delight and i ll rate it out of director tim whelan who worked in britain as well as in hollywood deserves to be much better known
the fully rounded character of the principal role of this movie that of the cop torn up by his past and on a path of self destruction so clear to the viewer is unique for its time along with the haunting music and the well written plot the film is a prime example of film noir at its best close ups of dana s eyes reveal the anguish within karl malden excels as his boss who brooks no nonsense but also has compassion for those under his command in the precinct otto preminger made this type of movie just about his own if there is any fault it would be with the breath taking beauty of gene tierney who seems oddly out of place with the hardened cop their scenes in the cafe however are wonderful and ring true tom tully in the bit part of her father is perfect as is gary merrill as the hood great lighting and mood setting the building where the deadly deeds take place highly atmospheric i love the old woman in the basement out of
for a while i was caught in the trap where i found myself watching independent and foreign films and lying to myself that i liked them fatty drives the bus is the exception it is the truth it is the best bad movie ever the badness of this movie seems to come naturally halfway through satan s opening monologue the word hell appears at the bottom of the screen the glamorous bridget is an unshaven man in a wig and a thrift store dress it takes the eccentric couple that keeps trying to kill each other forever to walk down the stairs jesus walks to a funk soundtrack anyways fatty gives the impression that someone lost their tenure for advising a senior s film project but it s the sincerity of how bad it is that makes it so wonderful you get the impression the makers knew it was going to be bad but never forced it never to be duplicated in wonder fatty delivers highly highly recommended
being the beatlemaniac that i am i approached two of us with a combination of fear and fascination having seen in his life the john lennon story i was quite concerned that two of us will turn out no better the fact that aidan quinn and jared harris look absolutely nothing like john lennon and paul mccartney even with some make up and proper hairdos didn t help one bit but i was more than a bit pleasantly surprised it s probably thanks to the involvement of michael lindsay hogg who directed let it be in and consequently probably knew john and paul quite well that the characters and the dialogue came across as convincing as they did the writing credit for two of us is given to a man named mark stanfield of whom i know absolutely nothing i feel confident that director lindsay hogg had more than a bit to do with the script two of us is not a biography of the beatles it has very little plot in fact and takes place all in one day in new york city what it does is imagine a meeting between john and paul in while john lived in new york that meeting is entirely fictitious of course though it can t truly be disproved that such a meeting actually took place but through that imagined conversation it gives us a glimpse into the personalities of these two great musicians their intelligence their sense of humor their different reaction to stardom and most of all their relationship what made them such a great team and what broke them up since it s a talk movie nothing much except for dialogue between two characters for an hour and a half it s likely to bore all but true fans of the beatles but it s a fantastic piece of writing and storytelling and is both informative and touching for those interested in these two musical giants very quickly you ll get over the shock of how different the actors look from their counterparts and feel like john and paul had come to life so intimate and convincing is the script and so committed are the actors two of us gives you priceless insight into the lives of two geniuses and a tale that is both sad and funny most certainly recommended
this is a gem of a movie not just for people who like fun and quirky premises but who love the history and traditions of sci fi and classic hollywood movies each alien of the martian crew is the embodiment of a classic sci fi character or member of hollywood royalty and it s pure pleasure watching them bounce of each other and the residents of big bean
criminals perry smith and richard dick hickock believe mr clutter of holcomb kansas keeps a large supply of cash on hand in a safe on november at two a m they end up murdering mr and mrs clutter and their teenage son and daughter after a little police investigation the two men are found and sentenced to be hanged in cold blood is directed by richard brooks now i haven t read the truman capote novel this movie is based on so i can t make any comparisons the movie does a brilliant job telling of those horrific events that actually took place robert blake is excellent as perry of course blake had the murder case of his own a few years back being accused of murdering his wife he s free now but we still don t know the truth what ever that may be he s still a very fine actor scott wilson does remarkable job as hickock john forsythe is terrific as alvin dewey paul stewart is very good as jensen jeff corey is marvelous as mr hickock same thing with charles mcgraw who plays tex smith john mcliam portrays herbert clutter ruth storey is his wife bonnie brenda currin is the daughter nancy and paul hough is the son kenyon great job by each of them there is much to remember from this film let s start from the lighter side it s pretty great when perry wants to go hunting for gold in mexico and says to hickock remember bogart in treasure of the sierra madre and blake himself was in that movie as a boy and it s a fun moment when they giving a ride to that boy and his granddad collect bottles and turn them in for refund money those darker moments are the most haunting ones the flashback sequence where you see the murders happening is extremely terrifying when perry goes to kill the girl nancy last and she says oh please don t the brutality of man it s impossible to explain then the hanging scene first there goes hickock and then perry first talking to the minister in the last image of the movie we see perry hitting the end of the rope sure movies and books may try to sympathize these villains especially perry s character is someone you could feel sorry for he thinks of his mom and dad who he hates but still loves but it doesn t change the fact both of these men these actors portray are brutal murderers who don t feel sorry for anybody they go to this house and murder an entire family in cold blood how could you sympathize these people
i almost did not go see this movie because i remember march of the penguin was not that much exciting i went mainly because disney promised to plant a tree if i go see it on the opening weekend but after i did go see it it was simply amazing the fact that the photographers can capture impossible images are simply worth your money you also get to see different habitats different vegetation animals and natural phenomenons that will not only shock you simply because you would never expect nature to be so magical and dynamic but also touch your souls and raise the question of humanity versus the world of how our lives have deviated from nature to such a degree that we take for granted of the natural beauty and miracles that are quintessential to our biosphere you don t have to be an earth lover or a tree hugging environmentalist to appreciate the mere awesomeness of this documentary you simply have to be a curious soul who questions the value and miracle of living enjoy
where was this film when i was a kid after his parents split up tadashi moves with his mom to live his his grandfather tadashi s sister stays with their dad and they talk frequently on the phone grandfather is only here every third day moms never really home the kids always are picking on the poor kid during a village festival tadashi is chosen the kirin rider or spiritual champion of the peace and justice little does he suspect that soon he will have to actually step into role of hero as the forces of darkness join up with the rage of things discarded in a plot to destroy mankind and the spiritual world okay that was the easy part now comes the hard part trying to explain the film this is a great kids film no this is a great film flawed very flawed but a great film none the less it unfolds like all of those great books you loved as a kid and is just as dense at times as tadashi struggles to find the strength to become a hero watching it i felt i was reading a great book and thought how huge this would have been if it was a book i loved that the film does not follow a normal path things often happen out of happenstance or through miscommunication one character gets sucked into events simply because his foot falls asleep there are twists and turns and moments that seem like non sequiters and are all the more charming for it which is typical miike certainly its a takashi miike film that japanese master of film is clearly in charge of a film that often touching scary and funny all at the same time no one except miike seems to understand that you can have many emotions at the same time or that you can suddenly have twists as things get dark one second and then funny the next i admire the fact that miike has made a film that is bleak and hopeful that doesn t shy away from being scary i mean really scary especially for kids this is the same dark territory that should be in the harry potter movies but rarely is this a dark grimms tale with humor my first reaction upon seeing the opening image was that i couldn t believe anyone would begin a kids film with a picture of the end of the world then i realized who was making the movie hats off to miike for making a movie that knows kids can handle the frightening images its also operating on more than one level the mechanical monsters that the bad guys make are forged from mankind s discarded junk its the rage of being thrown away that fuels the monsters one of the yokai spirits talks about the rage sneakers thrown away because they are dirty or too small feels when they are tossed you also have one of the good guys refusing to join the bad guys because that would be the human thing to do its a wild concept but like other things floating around its what lifts this movie to another level there are a good many riffs and references to other movies tv shows and novels that make me wonder who this film is for since kids may not understand them though many parents will and of course there are the monsters they run the gamut from cheesy to spectacular with stops everywhere in between frankly you have to forgive the unevenness of their creation simply because they are has to be hundreds if not thousands of monsters on screen its way cool and it works one of the main characters is a yokai which i think is best described as a hamster in a tunic and is often played by a stuffed animal it looks dumb and yet you will be cheering the little bugger and loving every moment he rides on tadashi s head acceptance is also easier if you ve ever seen the old woodcuts of the weird japanese monsters i mentioned flaws and there are a few the effects are uneven some of the sudden turns are a bit odd even if understandable and a few other minor things which are fading now some two hours after watching the film none of them truly hurt the film over all however most kind of keep you from being completely happy with the movie i really loved this movie i m pretty sure that if i saw this as a kid it would have been my favorite film of all time where s the english dub see this movie its a great trip besides its a good introduction to the films of miike minus the blood and graphic sex
bleak house is hands down the finest adaptation of a charles dickens novel ever put on screen alway one of my favorite novels i was exteremely pleased with this television mini series the late great denholm elliot was perfectly cast as the noble john jardyce and diana rigg was sheer perfection as the doomed ladty dedlock the film captures the essence of dickens era and is extremely faithful to the book oly making minor plot cuts that do not effect the story over all a brilliant moving and atmosphereic film
with the amount of actors they have working on the project they have a wide variety of cast nice starship cgi in places but their green screen needs some work anyone heard of adobe after effects they should buy it get their keying better stories are well thought out plenty of trek elements in this to keep it in the right context but but the idea of two guys kissing makes me wind forward the episode im not homophobic but i cant help that i don t find men kissing entertaining dont mind women anyway for a fan series this is good stuff with minor improvement in their green screen brush up acting and some guidance ratings this series is stunning anyway i recommend this series to who ever enjoyed tng and ds
man s castle is set in one of those jerry built settlements on vacant land and parks that during these times were called hoovervilles named after our unfortunate st president who got stuck with the great depression occurring in his administration the proposition of this film is that a man s home is still his castle even when it s just a shack in a hooverville spencer tracy has such a shack and truth be told this guy even in good times would not be working all that much but in a part very typical for tracy before he was cast as a priest in san francisco the start of a slew of classic roles he s playing a tough good natured mug who takes in loretta young one of the things about man s castle is that it shows the effects of the depression on women as well as men women had some additional strains put on them if men had trouble finding work women had it twice as hard and they were sexually harassed and some resorted to prostitution just for a square meal spence takes loretta young in who s facing those kind of problems and makes no demands on her in his castle pretty soon though they re in love though tracy is not the kind to settle down the love scenes had some extra zing to them because tracy and young were having a torrid affair during the shooting of man s castle and both were catholic and married and in those days that was an insuperable barrier to marriage both tracy and young took the catholic faith quite seriously also in the cast are walter connolly as a kind of father figure for the whole camp marjorie rambeau who s been through all the pitfalls young might encounter and tries to steer her clear and arthur hohl a really loathsome creep who has his eye on young as well hohl brings the plot of man s castle to its climax through his scheming man s castle is grim look at the great depression not the usual movie escapist fare for those trying to avoid that kind of reality in their entertainment
mel gibson s braveheart was a spectacularly accomplished film but it left a sour taste in the mouth rob roy by contrast is slightly less polished but a better film by far this is a historical film which combines timeless themes with truly historical values whereas braveheart put a gross and unpleasant comtemporary gloss on an ancient tale what makes this film is the cast liam neeson plays the hero in a role he basically reprised in a watered down fashion in the phantom menace the character is heroic but is neither the greatest fighter nor the most demonic lover admirable yet human he commands the screen against him are set a selection of equally human adversaries including tim roth s cunningham obnoxious but brilliant and john hurt s morally bankrupt laird also to praise is jessica lange as rob s pragmatic wife also strong and noble but years away from a modern heroine which is only as it should be this is not the most original film you will see but it has the courage of its own convictions and the strong performances make you care
in the periphery of s o paulo the very low middle class dysfunctional and hypocrite family of teodoro giulio lopes cl udia leona cavalli and the teenager soninha s lvia louren o have deep secrets the religious teodoro is indeed a hit man hired to kill people in the neighborhood with his friend waldomiro ailton gra a he has a lover the very devout woman terezinha martha meola and he wants to regenerate going to the country with her cl udia has a young lover j lio ismael de ara jo who delivers meats for his father s butcher shop soninha is a common sixteen years old teenager of the periphery having active sexual life smoking grass and loving heavy metal when j lio is killed and castrated in their neighborhood the lives of the members of the family change contra todos is a great low budget brazilian movie that pictures the life in the periphery of a big brazilian city the story is very real uses the usual elements of the poor area of the big brazilian cities drug dealers hit men fanatic religious evangelic people hopeless teenagers etc has many plot points and a surprising end and the characters have excellent performances acting very natural and making the story totally believable the camera follows the characters giving a great dynamics to the film in the extras of the dvd the director roberto moreira explains that his screenplay had no lines only the description of the situations and was partially disclosed only one week before the beginning of the shootings the actors have trainings in workshops and they used lots of improvisation being the reason for such natural acting my vote is eight title brazil contra todos against everybody
when it first came out this work by the meysels brothers was much criticized and even judged to be exploitation luckily it is now hailed as a masterpiece of documentary cinema especially now that society has been exposed to real exploitation in what is reality television and the bad evolution of most direct cinema really at first we must say that this isn t really direct cinema it is more cinema verit the difference between the two is very slight but it mainly is the fact that in this documentary we are made to feel the presence of the meysels brothers and they do interact with the characters filmed this as well makes it clear that it is not exploitation the meysels have been allowed in the house and they are included in what is a very eccentric situation of a very eccentric household and both edith and edie just love the idea of being filmed it would have been very disappointing had very been shown only a voice of god narration and shallow interviews here we are given a full portrait of the madness of the house a madness that does seem to go down well with both edie and her mother edith their house is a mess litter and animals everywhere faded colors and furniture all over the house and the constant fights that are constant interactions of reality these two people have lived with each other their whole life and are not fighting in front of the camera because they want the attention but rather because they can t help talking to each other this way they know each other too well to hide their inner feelings there is no need in the end though even as they blame each other for their lives they really love each other deeply edie says she doesn t want her mother to die because she loves her very much and edith says that she doesn t want edie to leave her because she doesn t want to be alone but the most interesting aspect of the film is that regardless of their old age the two women can t help be girls they cannot help being one the singer the other the dancer exhibit all their artistic skills in front of their camera when edie asks david meysels rhetorically where have you been all my life she is really very happy that she finally gets to show the whole world herself and her wonderful showgirls skills a beautiful portrait of stylistic importance and a charm that is highly unlikely to be ever seen again the way only the meysels and few others could do
well now this was certainly a surprise episode in this anthology science fiction series with all of this alien beings extraordinary occurrences and many brushes with the hereafter this episode would certainly rate as unusual its seemingly insignificant settings apparently not imparting any morale at story s end or does it kicking off with the silent movie form no recorded dialog but having musical accompaniment in this case it s on the sound track not utilizing the playing of organ or piano by an on sight musician this part of the episode along with the ending section also made liberal use o title cards just like the old time movies while these titles are a bit exaggerated and overdone they are made so intentionally and with an affection for rather than any contempt for the silent film veteran comedy film director norman z mcleod was the man in the chair for this half hour installment he had been the director of many of the greatest comedies of all time featuring people like the marx brothers w c fields harold lloyd and danny kaye he was no stranger to to tv as he had done a lot of work on television series it doesn t appear that he and mr keaton had ever worked together before as i cannot find any evidence of this but judging by the outcome of the film they succeeded in doing so with flying colors anyone who directed keaton was aware that buster was also a fine comedy director as well as a comedy player he was just as comfortable behind the camera as he was in front of it their short partnership must have been a harmonious one with give and take about how to do things it is apparent that many of the gags were keaton s resurrected from his own silent picture days for example the gag of putting the pair of pants on with rollo s stanley adams assistance was done by keaton and roscoe fatty arbuckle in one of the arbuckle reelers the garage that was a clear example of his craft in a nutshell buster knew that we film our world with a camera rendering it a two dimensional image this one fact is at the bottom of so many of gags it is a cardinal rule for his film making the cast was small and once again just chock full of veteran talent stanley adams was rollo and served as mr keaton s straight man jesse white the old maytag repair man ran the fix it shop that fixed the time hjelmet gil lamb serene veteran of rko short comedy series was the s cop james flavin george e stone harry fleer warren parker and milton parsons all rounded out this largely silent cast without spilling the beans let s just say that yes there is probably a lesson to be learned here if not the one already mentioned the grass always looks greener on the other side of the fence then how about be careful in what you ask for because you just may get it
director raoul walsh was like the michael bay of the s and years before that and i mean that in a positive way since i m definitely ain t no bay hater his movies are just simple high quality entertainment just like the raoul walsh movies were in his days gentleman jim is fine quality entertainment besides a first class director it also features a first grade cast with raoul walsh s regular leading man errol flynn in the main part what surprised me was how well the boxing matches were brought to the screen they used some very dynamic camera work which also really made the boxing matches uplifting and exciting to watch with the end championship fight against john l sullivan as the ultimate highlight biopics of the s and earlier on were obviously still very much different from biographies being made this present day modern biographies often glorify its main subject and show his her life from basically birth till death and everything mostly emotional aspects in between old biopics were just made the same as movies that weren t based on actual real life persons which also means that the film makers would often use a use amount of creative liberty with the main character s personality and events that happened in his her life this movie is also not just a biography about a boxing legend but also forms a nice portrayal from the period when illegal bare knuckle fighting entered the modern era of boxing errol flynn does a great job portraying the real life famous boxer james j corbett aka gentleman jim not too many people known it but flynn did some real good acting jobs in the s of which this movie is one fysicaly he also looks in top shape he also looks quite different by the way without his trademark small mustache in this movie the movie also features some fine supporting actors and some fine acting throughout a great and entertaining movie that also still truly holds up real well today
brando plays the ace jet pilot just back from shooting migs down in the korean war on leave he discovers his madame butterfly falls in love the lovers both see the folly of racism and the cruelty which conservative cultural norms can bring to human relations this film is an excellent romance with a nice twist which rejects the racist conservative standards dominant at the time it was made in sayonara will make you laugh and cry beware though sometimes the musical background will make you wish it was not there although irving berlin s title song will entice your memory for a very long time after your theatre lights come on again
i ve seen the original english version on video disney s choice of voice actors looks very promising i can t believe i m saying that the story is about a young boy who meets a girl with a history that is intertwined with his own the two are thrown into one of the most fun and intriguing storylines in any animated film the animation quality is excellent if you ve seen disney s job of kiki s delivery service you can see the quality in their production it almost redeems them for stealing the story of kimba the white lion but not quite finally miyazaki s films are being released properly i can t wait to see an uncut english version of nausicaa
this has been one of my favorite movies for a long time recently i was happy to see it on dvd which is a relief from watching the old grainy vhs versions i hadn t seen it in years and watched it today to find myself amazed at how well the movie stands up to time it s one of those rare perfect storms of comedy where great writing truly funny line after truly funny line is paired with great direction and outstanding performances all at the same time dudley moore got an oscar nomination for arthur but lost although john gielgud won for best supporting actor if moore s performance in arthur doesn t win a best actor oscar it s proof that no comedic actor could ever win the title another example is gene wilder in young frankenstein steve gordon crafts the film beautifully keeping true to each of the characters and the warm hearted tone of the story quite simply imho the movie is a rare gem it s only sad that steve gordon passed away just a year after arthur was released regarding the dvd that is available as of it s so so although the video quality is a leap over the old vhs copies there is still no widescreen version available the dvd has a few extras that are nice but it s just not enough one example is commentary from the director stating how he greatly wished how certain deleted takes and scenes could have been included because they were hysterical but that he had to make tough choices for a final edit the dvd being the perfect format to include such material certainly should have offered it as well this the original arthur is a classic comedy that is one for the books
this is a very unusual film in that the star with the top billing doesn t appear literally until half way in nevertheless i was engaged by the hook of the phantom lady curtis though competent as the falsely accused scott henderson looks a little tough to be be sympathetic towards perhaps he should have shaved his moustache and his behavior when he first comes home should have convinced the cops at least to some degree of his innocence while another commentator had a problem with franchot tone as jack marlowe i found his portrayal of the character to be impressively complex he is no stock villain superb character actor elisha cook jr is again in top form as the little man with big ambitions his drumming in the musical numbers added a welcome touch of eroticism this movie however is carried by the very capable and comely ella raines as the devoted would be lover of henderson carol richmond she definitely has talent and her screen presence is in the tradition of lauren bacall this is the first of her work i have seen and i am definitely inclined to see her other roles the rest of the supporting cast is also more than competent all in all a very satisfying film noir mystery which when viewed today fully conveys the dark and complex urban world it is intended to recommended
this was the modesty that we didn t know it was hinted at and summarized in the comic strip for the syndicates to sell to newspapers lee and janet batchler were true modesty blaise fans who were given the dream job tell a prequel story of modesty that the fans never saw before in their audio commentary they admitted that that they made changes in her origin to make the story run smoother the purists should also note that we really don t know if everything she told miklos was true because she was stalling for time i didn t rent or borrow the dvd like other reviewers did i bought it and i don t want a refund i watched it three times and i didn t sleep through it great dialog and well drawn characters that i cared about even bad guy miklos just like in the novels and comic strips i too can t wait for the next modesty and willie film especially if this prequel is a sign of what s to come
emilio miraglia s first giallo feature the night evelyn came out of the grave was a great combination of giallo and gothic horror and this second film is even better we ve got more of the giallo side of the equation this time around although miraglia doesn t lose the gothic horror stylings that made the earlier film such a delight miraglia puts more emphasis on the finer details of the plot this time around and as a result it s the typical giallo labyrinth with characters all over the place and red herrings being thrown in every few minutes this is a definite bonus for the film however as while it can get a little too confusing at times there s always enough to hold the audience s interest and miraglia s storytelling has improved since his earlier movie the plot opens with a scene that sees two young girls fighting before their grandfather explains to them the legend behind a rather lurid painting in their castle the legend revolves around a woman called the red queen who legend has it returns from the grave every hundred years and kills seven people a few years later murders begin to occur even though he only made two giallo s miraglia does have his own set of tributes it s obvious that the colour red is important to him as it features heavily in both films and he appears to have something against women called evelyn he likes castles gothic atmospheres and stylish murders too which is fine by me miraglia may be no argento when it comes to spilling blood but he certainly knows how to drop an over the top murder into his film and here we have delights involving a volkswagen beetle and a death on an iron fence that is one of my all time favourite giallo death scenes the female side of the cast is excellent with the stunning barbara bouchet and marina malfatti heading up an eye pleasing cast of ladies that aren t afraid to take their clothes off the score courtesy of bruno nicolai is catchy and even though it doesn t feature much of the psychedelic rock heard in the night evelyn came out of the grave it fits the film well the ending is something of a turn off as although miraglia revs up the gothic atmosphere it comes across as being more than a little bit rushed and the identity of the murderer is too obvious but even so this is a delightfully entertaining giallo and one that i highly recommend to fans of the genre
i take issue with the other reviewer s comments for the simple reason that this is a mystery film not a supernatural one it is not the only film to have a seemingly supernatural explanation vampires but turns out to be a very mundance one other films that come to mind are edgar wallace s before dawn and the more famous mark of the vampire the film does a wonderful job in creating a very spooky atmosphere similar dracula when renfield meets the count on the staircase of his castle or in mark of the vampire when the two people look thru the windows of the castle ruins and see a corpse playing an organ while luna descends using wings very surreal if one likes these often silent atmospheric touches this film is a must norm vogel
everything was better in past days even children s television and fraggle rock proves my point quite easily at the time of writing this comment i am fourteen years old but even in my teen years i can t resist the charm of fraggle rock for those of you that have indeed been living under a rock haha fraggle rock is about a horde of playful and goofy creatures called fraggles who live amazingly in a rock but they re not the only creatures the rock is inhabited with many other species like the hardworking doozers and countless living plants outside the rock on one side live inventor scientist doc and his dog sprocket who later befriends gobo fraggle on the other side a family of gorgs supposed rulers of the universe the five main fraggles gobo fearless leader mokey arty and peaceful wembley indecisive and a friend to gobo boober a pessimistic domestic god and red loves anything to do with sport and general feistyness get caught up in some strange situations each episode while at the same time sing and dance their cares away fraggle rock is definitely a family show the plots may have intricate details that infants may not follow well but the song and dance routines will hold their attention the characters are strong and likable their conflicts believable and their adventures thrilling the gorgs are frightening doc and sprocket enlightening uncle travelling matt hilarious the postcard segments are very s and the final episode change of address genuinely touching let s go down to fraggle rock again
after a dirty shame i never thought that i was going to see another john waters movie that movie was really so bad that i was convinced that all his movies would be like that but when the dvd of this movie was reviewed in a popular magazine and they said that this was an excellent movie i decided to give it a try anyway only a couple of days later it was shown on television i taped it out of curiosity and now that i ve seen it i can tell you that this pecker sure is a lot better than a dirty shame in this movie we see how a young nobody from baltimore becomes an overnight sensation in the art world of new york he s a sandwich shop employee who photographs his weird family or things that he sees on the street as a hobby when he keeps his very first exhibition in the shop where he works his pictures are noticed by a gallery owner who loves the pictures full of misery and weirdness his photographs are sold for enormous prices but when he sees how his family friends and strangers react to his success he decides that he will no longer go to new york they will have to come to him if they want to see more of him and they do but what they get to see there is a bigger shock than they could ever imagine it s not difficult to see why i loved this movie a lot more than a dirty shame the first reason is that this movie has an actual story this movie really has something to say and isn t just intended to shock as many people as possible the fact that they make fun of the art world who considers everything out of the ordinary as art because they don t know what the reality is like isn t just funny it s not that far from the truth either i guess there are many people who feel about modern art that way nobody understands why they are making such a fuss about it but apparently we are all supposed to like it the second reason why i liked this movie is because this one had much better acting performances to offer i m not saying that everything that you will see is great but at least the characters have some meaning thanks to the performances of the different actors like edward furlong christina ricci overall this isn t a great movie but thanks to its criticism and some good jokes which never really go too far this is an enjoyable movie it certainly isn t the best comedy ever but i liked it a lot more than a dirty shame i give this movie a
okay this film probably deserves out of stars but i ve voted for to help offset the misleading rating from the handful of bozo s who gave this film zero or star reviews each of the segments for this anthology shows great potential and promise for the talented filmmakers three of whom have gone on to achieve notable success in big time hollywood productions performances range from rough all the way up to completely impressive with notable turns by bill paxton james karen vivian schilling and brion james martin kove may be a big melodramatic as the psychotic hypnotist with the bizarro strobe lamp and lance august seems intentionally dimwitted as an unsuspecting lab victim but overall it s got some great laughs and some genuinely scary moments definitely worth seeing so judge for yourself
the sentinel is a movie that was recommended to me years ago by my father and i ve seen it many times since it always manages to entertain me while being effectively creepy as well the flashback scenes are what really made it for me cristina raines s father running around all creepily with the two creepy woman always manages to send chills down my spine it s your typical good vs evil thing but at least it manages to be entertaining the ending i consider to be one of the finest in horror history it has plenty of shocks and suspense seeing burgess meredith do his thing as chazen had me on the edge of my seat the sentinel has the perfect build up of tension we are never fully comfortable whenever allison is on screen we know something terrible is always awaiting her and that made things all the more tense this movie is often neglected among horror fans but i personally think it s one of the better one s out there and it certainly has enough for all horror fans to be satisfied performances cristina raines has her wooden moments but came though in a big way for the most part she s beautiful to look at and her chemistry with saranadon felt natural chris sarandon is great as the boyfriend michael he had an instant screen presence and i couldn t help but love him martin balsam jos ferrer john carradine ava gardner arthur kennedy sylvia miles deborah raffin jerry orbach richard dreyfuss jeff goldblum and tom berenger all have memorable roles or small cameos burgess meredith is terrific as chazen he looks like a normal old man but what we find out is absolutely terrifying eli wallach christopher wlaken do well as the bumbling detectives beverly d angelo has one chilling scene that i won t spoil bottom line the sentinel is an effective horror film that horror fans sadly tend to neglect it will give you the thrills and scares you need to be satisfied well worth the look
i gave this a out of points i love it so much i am a child of the s and totally into heavy metal for many years those are the reasons i like this movie so much its so cool to see those posters in the bedroom of that boy judas priest lizzy borden raven twisted sister and his vinyl collection unveiling the wicked by exciter rise of the mutants by shock metal master impaler and killing is my business by megadeth also the soundtrack by fastway is totally incredible and fits very well with the plot if you are into metal then trick or treat is your friend don t buy or watch this movie for ozzy or gene simmons because they are in the movie for seconds watch it because the soundtrack and the story that will take you back to the glory s you will not be the same person after
i first saw blood of the samurai at its premiere during the hawaii international film festival wow blood just blew us away with its sheer verve gore vitality gore excitement gore utter campiness and even more gore and all in such great fun especially for those of you who enjoy all those japanese chambara samurai and ninja films you definitely have to see blood
s s van dine must have been a shrewd businessman in dealing with hollywood most of the film series from the studio days were usually confined to one or two studios but apparently van dine must have sold his rights to each book about philo vance one at a time note that paramount mgm warner brothers and more all released philo vance films only tarzan seemed to get around hollywood more mgm produced the garden murder case and starred edmund lowe as the fashionable detective of course mgm had the screen s original philo under contract at the time but bill powell was busy doing the thin man at the time and i guess louis b mayer decided to concentrate him there edmund lowe is a pretty acceptable philo vance lowe had started out pretty big at the tail end of the silent era with what price glory and then with a string of films with victor mclaglen with their flagg and quirt characters but after mclaglen got his oscar for the informer lowe seemed to fade into the b picture market the garden murder case involves three separate victims douglas walton gene lockhart and frieda inescourt the sinister atmosphere around the perpetrator kind of gives it away the mystery is really how all the killings are connected and how they are accomplished i will say this though vance takes a very big chance in exposing the villain and the last minutes are worthy of hitchcock
pushing daisies truly is a landmark in television as an art form everything seems to pay homage to amelie and tim burton but so what in a world where fresh ideas are distinctly rare this show will guarantee that you do not care about whether its fresh or not it is just brilliant i have been captivated from the start the intelligent writing the directing to the backdrops and dialogue make this show the most incredible masterpiece since the shield and the wire ok not exactly good comparisons but the beauty of pushing daisies is that it has no comparisons on television truly addictive and an absolute pleasure perhaps like one of the piemakers pies that get mentioned in such tantalising ways
this is one irresistible great cheerful and technically greatly made movie the movie features some of the greatest looking sets you ll ever see in a s movie even though it s all too obvious that they are sets rather than real place locations often if a character would fall or shake a doorpost too aggressive the entire set would obviously move the best moments of the movie were the silent more old fashioned slapstick kind of moments it shows that ren clair s true heart was at silent movie making the overall humor is really great in this movie also of course the musical moments were more than great this is a really enjoyable light and simple pleasant early french musical though the best moments are the silent moments that does not mean that the movie is not filled with some great humorous dialog that gets very well delivered by the main actors who all seemed like stage actors to me which in this case worked extremely well for the movie its overall style and pleasant no worries atmosphere no wonder this worked out so well since this movie is actually based on stage play by georges berr it s a technical really great movie with also some great innovation camera work in it and some really great editing that create some fast going and pleasant to watch enjoyable sequences there is never a dull moment in this movie ren clair was such a clever director who knew how to build up and plan comical moments within in movies it s a very creative made movie that despite its simplicity still at all times feel as a totally original and cleverly constructed movie that never seizes to entertain the last half hour is especially unforgettably fun without spoiling too much and is really among the greatest as well as most creative moments in early comedy film making the movie is filled with some really enjoyable characters who are of course all very stereotypical and silly and were obviously cast because of their looks it all adds to the pleasant light comical atmosphere and cuteness of the movie one of the most pleasant movies you ll ever see
the maxx is a deep psychological introspective lightly camouflaged as a weird out superhero story julie winters is a freelance social worker in an unnamed filthy city ridden with crime and she and everyone she knows has a lot of issues to work through the maxx is her friend and client a street bum who thinks he s a costumed superhero or is it the other way around the maxx is not to be missed for the artwork the story itself or the excellent voice work particularly the late barry stigler s deliciously urbane drippingly evil voicing of the main villain mr gone if you get the chance to see this don t miss it
i have always been a fan of david lynch and with this film lynch proved to critics that he has the talent style and artistic integrity to make films outside of the surreal aura that he s become known for in the past decade as much as the film is g rated it s pure lynch in style pacing and tone the film moves at a masterfully hypnotic pace and is filled with scenes of genuine emotion and power the cinematography is terrific as is to be expected from a lynch film and the transitional montage sequences are breathtaking it s also very refreshing to see a film where the characters are all friendly kindhearted folk and not unmotivated characters that are clearly labeled as being either good or evil richard farnsworth turns in a beautiful performance as do the rest of the cast most notably sissy spacek in an endearing performance as his daugher and harry dean stanton in a small but infinitely crucial role with this film david lynch proved to critics that he could make a powerful moving motion picture just like he did in the s with blue velvet and the elephant man critics seemed to lose faith in the past decade after he produced such surreal films as twin peaks fire walk with me and lost highway but with this film he showed that there was method to fwwm and lh and it looks as if critics finally caught on with his recent film mulholland drive considering the high praise it s received and the oscar nomination for lynch straight story is to me one of the most moving motion pictures i ve ever seen it s a loving story about family friendship and the kindness of strangers i would highly recommend it
it follows block heads and a chump at oxford two films that are hard to top not that saps at sea is a bad film it is the last good comedy unless one insists on jitterbugs or another of the later films that laurel hardy made it s just that it is a toss off little film without the crazy destructive crescendo of block heads or the astounding sight of stan s real personality in a chump at oxford to revel in at minutes it is shorter than the other two films a bit but that actually is not a bad point for it it has just enough time to it to hit the right notes it s just not as special as the other two stan and ollie work in a factory that manufactures horns i suspect that there was a bit of chaplin influence in this sequence one recalls a similar assembly line incident in modern times only four years earlier ollie s nerves finally snap and he goes on a rampage he goes home and naturally his roommate stan does not help stan has a music lesson with an eccentric professor on his instrument you ve got it a trombone after beating up the poor professor ollie has problems with the incompetent janitor engineer ben turpin in a nice brief appearance and then faces his doctor jimmy finleyson and his nerve tester a balloon that inflates as you push air out of ollie s stomach finleyson announces that it is a bad case of horniphobia and ollie needs a vacation with plenty of quiet and goat s milk they end up going to a ship but ollie and stan know nothing about seamanship so they plan to sleep on the ship unfortunately the goat gnaws the rope until it breaks and the ship sails off also unfortunately on board is richard cramer an escaped dangerous criminal this is not going to be a peaceful vacation saps at sea like a chump could have been three shorts one at the factory one at the apartment and one on the boat each would have been a successful short and they all make a funny film but the stitching of the parts together shows there are some very amusing moments in the film the discoveries of how turpin s ineptitude causes various mishaps with water taps and stoves in the apartment the accidental remarks of building manager charlie hall when stan or ollie runs by him and asks for directions can you help me find the basement asks stan certainly you can t miss it it s downstairs says hall who realizes what a stupid comment he just made and cramer s mistreatment of his two hostage slaves he calls ollie dizzy and stan daffy an allusion to the dean brothers of the st louis cardinal teams of the s see dan dailey s the pride of st louis cramer has the boys cook him up some food and they make a synthetic meal boot laces for spaghetti for instance to get him sick to be overpowered when he realizes what they have done he forces them to eat the meal themselves their reactions are brilliant saps at sea is not on par with the top line of laurel hardy films but it is a good film on the whole and a good conclusion to the best years of their film career when they were with hal roach in the immediate couple of years before it appeared the boys and roach had serious problems involving production costs our relations where stan was producer on the film artistic problems scenes from swiss miss were cut meaninglessly and contractual arguments leading to ollie appearing with harry langdon in zenobia stan and ollie hit back with the flying deuces wherein the production was not roach s but boris morros at last a two picture deal of a chump at oxford and saps at sea concluded the arguments and problems and on a high note the boys left roach unfortunately they never found any subsequent film relationship with a producer as satisfactory as this had been

crush examines female friendship for the most part avoiding the saccharine quality which spoils so many films with the same theme e g steel magnolias at the same time it reveals the power of a sudden passion to overwhelm and surprise the events depicted were highly improbable but the underlying emotional truth seemed very genuine to me not a film for the speeding vehicle and explosion crowd but grown up women are certain to respond with both laughter and tears
of the three remakes of this plot i like them all i have all three on vhs and in addition have a copy of this one on dvd there is just enough variation in the scripts to make all three entertaining and re watchable in addition has any other film been remade three times with such all star casts in each of course the main stars in this one are great but the supporting actors are also superb i particularly like william tracy as pepi he was such a scene stealer that i have searched to find other movies he is in he appeared in many but most are not available as the other comments i also say buy this one
the folk who produced this masterful film have done fine service to a novel that stands as perhaps the best fiction work centering upon human guilt and human responsibility ever published nolte takes the role of howard w campbell jr and makes it his own remaining true to vonnegut s depiction of a man who has lost all to and for love no weaknesses in this fine adaptation
the absolute summum of the oeuvre of that crafty dane douglas sirk born detlef sierck written on the wind compels our prurient attention in every gaudy frame from its justly famous opening sequence with the leaves blowing into the baronial foyer of a texas mansion and the wind riffling the pages of the calendar into a flashback the movie compresses into its minutes all the familial intrigue that was to fuel such later little screen knockoffs as dallas dynasty and falcon crest over their years long runs the combination of wealth and dysfunction is a theme americans in our dollar based society find irresistible brother and sister robert stack and dorothy malone are the spoiled troubled heirs to the hadly oil fortune boyhood chum rock hudson and new bride lauren bacall are the sane outsiders who try to keep the lid on the roiling cauldron it s been rumored that the story was based on libby holmann s marriage into reynolds tobacco money as always the misfits get all the scenery to chew and the best lines to spit out malone in her oscar nabbing performance as the boozing nymphomaniac with a jones for hudson gets to detonate a whole fireworks display of them hudson while good can t compete with all this over the top emoting bacall starts out strong but grows recessive a mere plot convenience no matter with a succession of set pieces shot in extravagant hues sirk gives an object lesson in how to turn out overwrought melodrama set in the lush consumer paradise of late s america nobody ever did it better
i always feel strange and guilty saying it because i m a fairly well educated non teenager but i actually sort of like the olsen twins and i respect the movies they make even though i ve never really been their target audience when in rome was a traditional mary kate and ashley movie complete with the foreign travel accents motorbikes adult romance as a b storyline fashion orientation and even the gag reel over the credits i enjoyed myself when in rome and the other olsen twin movies never pretend to be anything they re not most of the time they only premiere on video and they never claim to be the next citizen kane or even an affair to remember my point is people who watch this movie and expect it to be anything other than another olsen twin movie will be disappointed that said those who are fans of the olsen twins will really enjoy themselves for those of us who ve watched them since the first episodes of full house it s really great to see them growing into more mature roles this movie provides important historical and geographical information just like many of their other movies remember downing street from winning london and the visit to the louvre from passport to paris as well as providing good clean fun that can be enjoyed by the whole family as long as i still feel like i m on my soapbox and as long as i can make it relevant to the movie let me take a moment to challenge those who reject the olsen twins in order to be a fan of the olsen twins you don t have to be some pre teen valley girl from california in fact that s not really the target audience if it were the mk a fashion line of clothes and accessories would be run through gap or some store like that not wal mart when in rome while it does feature high fashion and globe trotting and two girls from a valley in cali isn t really about that it s more about inspiring young girls who have initiative to let it take them places if that means setting the movie in some glamorous foreign city with cute guys on motorbikes so be it that s called marketing you take an idea and sell it by making it appealing at least they re sending a good message even if the means seem a little superficial basically don t knock the film until you ve seen it and then don t knock it until you ve tried to understand what the olsen twins do they encourage young girls to be creative intuitive and driven young women this movie does that i think just like their others kids enjoy parents do the same if you like the olsen twins you won t be disappointed
this stylistically sophisticated visual game presents a story within a story the protagonist is scriptwriter bart klever who fights persistently with his new text which is at the same time the screenplay of the film we re watching in the movie bart plays a scriptwriter writing the script of the film bart s struggle with the text becomes a narrative theme as does the environment of the flat where he works and takes care of his little girl the intimate environment offers ample opportunity for games of illusion involving space light colours and a couple of cats the outwardly simple world of the room is further complicated by the unstable dimensions of a text continually influenced by the filmmaker s interventions which appears on a computer monitor and serves as a counterpoint to the similarity mutable environment the constantly changing viewing angle complicates answers to questions which arise what is truth and what illusion which of the observed worlds is primary and superior to the rest can anything serve as a basic orientation point in the narrative space
i wish kids movies were still made this way dark and deep there was get this character development and charlie is the epitome of the dynamic character plot development superb animation emotional involvement and a rational relatable and consistent theme if not for the handful of song and dance routines you would never have thought this was a kids movie and this is why i give it such a high rating this movie is an excellent film let alone for a kids movie which brings me to my second point this has got to be the darkest kids movie i ve seen in quite some time this coming from a year old i d be shocked to see any child under the age of not completely terrified throughout a great deal of the latter half and some of the first half of the movie and it all ends with one of the saddest endings you could ever come across ala jurassic bark for those of you who are futurama fans and this is what makes this movie so good just because the movie universally evokes emotions we don t normally like to feel and assume are bad does not make the movie itself bad in fact it means it succeeded good funny movies are supposed to make us laugh good horror movies are supposed to make us scared good sad movies are supposed to make us sad my point is good movies are supposed to move you not simply entertain this movie moved me also this movie is incredibly violent by today s standards for a kids movie and contains subject matter that by today s standards may not be suitable for some children parents i d say watch it first i m not usually one to say anything about this kind of thing but i just saw this yesterday and it came as a surprise even to me
there are plenty of reviews on this page that will explain this movie s details far more eloquently than i could but i would like to offer a simple review for those who occasionally go to the movies for more than entertainment raising victor vargas is so true you will believe it this flick gets inside your head
a country boy aussie rules player mat goes to the city the night before an all important afl trial match where he is to be picked up by his cousin and then things go wrong his no hoper cousin has become mixed up in a drug deal involving local loan shark drug dealer tiny who looks like any gangster anywhere but is definitively australian needless to say mat becomes enmeshed in the chaos and it isn t long before thoughts of tomorrow s match are shunted to the back of his mind as the night s frantic events unravel accomplished western australian professional shakespearean actor toby malone puts in a sterling performance as young naive country boy mat and successfully plays a part well below his age best support comes from john batchelor as tiny and an entertaining role by david ngoombujarra as one of the cops following the events roll is fast paced often funny and a very worthwhile use of an hour
the film was shot at movie flats just off route near lone pine california north of the road to whitney portals you can still find splashes of cement and iron joists plastered across the rocks where the sets were built and you ll recognize the area from any randolph scott movie i won t bother with the plot since i m sure it s covered elsewhere the movie stars three athletes fairbanks fils who must have learned a good deal from his dad grant an acrobat in his youth and maclaughlin a professional boxer from south africa their physical skills are all on display not a moment of this movie is to be taken seriously it s about thugees a sect in india whence our english word thug i can t go through all the felicities of this movie but probably ought to point out that the director george stevens was a polymath with a background in laurel and hardy movies see his choreography of the fight scenes and went on to the infinitely long dissolves of shane and the diary of anne frank dynasties rose and fell geological epochs came and went while liz taylor and monty clift kissed in a place in the sun here in his comic mode he excels this is a story of male bonding and it would be easy too easy to read homoeroticism into it as many people do with howard hawks or hatred of women but it isn t that at all sometimes things portrayed on screen don t deserve too much in the way of heuristic attention men will form bonds by working together in a way that women do not women share secrets read deborah tannen nobody s idea of an anti feminist well when you think about it that s what evolution should have produced for most of human history about nine tenths of it hominids have been hunters and gatherers and the men tend to hunt and the women to gather hunting is more effective as a team enterprise men who were not very good at bonding were darwinianed out leaving men who have a lot of team spirit and grant fairbanks and maclaughlin have got it in spades sorry to ramble on about evolution but i m an anthropologist and it is an occupational disease did i ever tell you about the horse in vaitongi samoa that slipped on the cement and fell in the bathtub with me you ve got to watch the hooves joan fontaine is lovely really only got to know her in her later years and wondered why she was in so many movies i lived in saratoga california where her sister olivia dehavilland grew up and went to a convent school pretty place if you miss this adventurous lively farraginous chronicle of the british empahh at its height you should never forgive yourself it s so famous that it s parodied in the peter sellers movie the party yes the colonel s got to know
i enjoyed a lot watching this movie it has a great direction by the already know bigas luna born in spain and it is precisely in spain that the movie takes place in catalu a to be more precise luna explores once more the theme of an obcession in this case the obcession of a young boy for the women s milk there are some psychological concepts in this story such as the rejection complex that the elder son feels with the birth of his brother in the movie this is what leads to the obcession of the young boy who suddenly sees all his mother s milk go to the recently born son so he starts trying to find a breast who is able to feed him he finds it in a woman recently arrived and from here on the movie is all around this this movie lives a lot on imagery more than the story itself the espectator captures certain moments unforgettable moments and certain symbols the movie deserves a thourough analyses on almost everything that happens because it usually means something the surroundings the landscapes typical from the region as well as the surreal behaviors of the characters also symbolic and the excelent ambiguous soundtrack by nicola piovani transport us to another dimension not parallel to the real world but which intersects it from times to times worth living in that world worth watching this movie even though we may eventually and for moments get tired and a bit sick with the excessive obcession which is perhaps taken beyond the limits i also enjoyed the performance of the protagonist
this is widely viewed in australia as one of the best cop dramas ever produced here and for my money anywhere it s raw gritty the characters are real the situations are believable and it doesn t shy away from the darker side of life confronted every day by cops and the criminals victims lawyers and other people in their various orbits this show ran for seasons and was discontinued because the show didn t sell well overseas we are all sorry for its loss however like fawlty towers we will be able to revere this as a limited length series of uniformly high quality
okay okay maybe not the greatest i mean the exorcist and psycho and a few others are hard to pass up but the shining is way up there it is however by far the best stephen king story that has been made into a movie it s better than the stand better than pet sematary if not quite as scary better than cujo better than the green mile better the dolores claiborne better than stand by me just barely though and yes it s better than the shawshank redemption shut up it s better i don t care what the imdb top says i read that a couple of decades ago stanley kubrick was sorting through novels at his home trying to find one that might make a good movie and from the other room his wife would hear a pounding noise every half hour or so as he threw books against the wall in frustration finally she didn t hear any noise for almost two hours and when she went to check and see if he had died in his chair or something i tell this with all due respect of course she found him concentrating on a book that he had in his hand and the book was the shining and thank god too because he went on to convert that book into one of the best horror films ever stephen king can be thanked for the complexity of the story about a man who takes his wife and son up to a remote hotel to oversee it during the extremely isolated winter as he works on his writing jack nicholson can be thanked for his dead on performance as jack torrance how many movies has jack been in where he plays a character named jack as well as his flawless delivery of several now famous lines heeeeeere s johnny shelley duvall can be thanked for giving a performance that allows the audience to relate to jack s desires to kill her stanley kubrick can be thanked for giving this excellent story his very recognizable touch and whoever the casting director was can be thanked for scrounging up the creepiest twins on the planet to play the part of the murdered girls one of the most significant aspects of this movie necessary for the story as a whole to have its most significant effect is the isolation and it s presents flawlessly the film starts off with a lengthy scene following jack as he drives up to the old hotel for his interview for the job of the caretaker for the winter this is soon followed by the same thing following jack and his family as they drive up the windy mountain road to the hotel this time the scene is intermixed with shots of jack wendy and danny talking in the car in which kubrick managed to sneak in a quick suggestion about the evils of tv as wendy voices her concern about talking about cannibalism in front of danny who says that it s okay because he s already seen it on tv see it s okay he saw it on the television the hotel itself is the perfect setting for a story like this to take place and it s bloody past is made much more frightening by the huge echoing rooms and the long hallways these rooms with their echoes constantly emphasize the emptiness of the hotel but it is the hallways that really created most of the scariness of this movie and kubrick s traditional tracking shots give the hallways a creepy three dimensional feel early in the film there is a famous tracking shot that follows danny in a large circle as he rides around the halls on his big wheel is that what those are called and his relative speed as well as the clunking made by the wheels as he goes back and forth from the hardwood floors to the throw rugs gives the feeling of not knowing what is around the corner and being a stephen king story you expect something to jump out at you i think that the best scene in the halls as well as one of the scariest in the film is when danny is playing on the floor and a ball rolls slowly up to him he looks up and sees the long empty hallway and because the ball is something of a child s toy you expect that it must have been those horrendously creepy twins that rolled it to him anyway you get the point the shining is a damn scary movie besides having the rare quality of being a horror film that doesn t suck the shining has a very in depth story that really keeps you guessing and leaves you with a feeling that there was something that you missed had jack always been there like mr grady told him in the men s room was he really at that ball in or is that just someone who looks exactly like him if he has always been the caretaker as mr grady also said does that mean that it was him that went crazy and killed his wife and twin daughters and not mr grady after all it s one thing for a film to leave loose ends that should have been tied that s just mediocre filmmaking for example the amityville horror which obviously copied much of the shining as far as its subject matter did this but it is entirely different when a film is presented in a way that really makes you think as mostly all of kubrick s movies are one more thing that we can all thank stanley kubrick for and we should thank him for is for not throwing this book against the wall that one toss would have been cinematic tragedy
this is a great movie in the same genre of the memphis belle seen it about years ago and would like to see it again there is a link with the history of the hells angels how the pilot crew fight the germans in wo and most changes form pilots to harley motor cycle rs the movie is in a way really happened see the movie and reed the history of the hells angels at hells at hells angels com regards frederik cast crew john stamos john stockwell teri polo kris kamm directed by graham baker more synopsis the story of a rowdy backwoods rebel biker who joins the army to avoid a stiff prison sentence after a minor brush with the law though he chafes at army discipline he soon proves himself under fire as a daring and charismatic leader of men in a motorcycle scout troop in pr world war ii spain more mpaa rating pg runtime minutes
larry burrows has the distinct feeling he s missing out on something ever since he missed a crucial baseball shot at school that cost the championship he s been convinced his life would have turned out better had he made that shot then one night his car breaks down again walking into the nearest bar to wait for the tow truck larry happens upon barman mike who unbeknown to larry is about to change his life for ever the alternate life premise in cinema is hardly a new thing stretching back to the likes of it s a wonderful life and showing no signs of abating with the quite recent sandler vehicle that was click it s a genre that has produced very mixed results back in was this james belushi led production rarely mentioned when the said topic arises it appears that it has largely been forgotten which is a shame since it oozes charm and is not short in the humour department we know that we are being led to its ultimate message come the end but it s a fun and enjoyable path to be led down the film also serves notice to what a fine comedy actor james belushi was i mean if his style of smart quipping and larking exasperation isn t your thing then chances are you would avoid this film anyway but for those engaged by the likes of red heat k and taking care of business well mr destiny is right up your street along for the ride are linda hamilton michael caine jon lovitz hart bochner jay o sanders rene russo and courteney cox mr destiny pure escapist fun with a kicker of a message at its heart
the movie holly is the story of a young girl who has been sold by her poor family and smuggled across the border to cambodia to work as a prostitute in the infamous k red light village in the movie holly is waiting to be sold at a premium for her virginity when she meets patrick who is losing money and friends through gambling and bar fights patrick and holly have an immediate bond over their stubbornness but this is all disrupted when holly is sold to a child trafficker and disappears as movie goers we are then thrust into patrick s pursuit to find holly again holly then shows her willingness to leave this lifestyle but her confusion on what is right and wrong holly carries us through the beautiful and harsh cambodia while discovering that holly is not just one girl she is the voice of millions of children who are exploited and violated every year with no rights or protection holly is less extreme than its subject matter might suggest such as documentaries that involve year olds and sexual trafficking but does manage to shed considerable light on cambodian vietnamese trafficking of children into prostitution it is a moving story that helps to shed light on the horrible situation in which many children face and their struggles to trust and realize what is right and wrong patrick the antagonist of the film is an american dealer of stolen artifacts who is also losing money and friends while playing cards and getting into bar fights while on a journey his motorbike runs out of fuel and he is forced to rent a room at a brothel during his stay he comes across holly a twelve year old girl who has been sold by her parents and is being abducted into slavery and prostitution holly and patrick begin a friendship of trust and understanding he discovers a clever stubborn girl beneath the traumatized exterior and becomes determined to save her though their strictly platonic relationship is misinterpreted by almost everyone they meet when she suddenly disappears he starts a journey to track her down without having thought if he can really help her holly is able to escape on her way to another brothel when she jumps from the truck and runs into a field filled with mines a mine is set off by a cow and the truck driver believes she is dead so holly is then left on her own during patrick s journey to find holly he meets a social worker who tries to talk some sense into him and shares the facts with him that haunts the cambodian region the idea of paying for her freedom simply fuels the demand she explains children in prostitution in cambodia next year it could be i m not trying to save he tells her i m trying to save one patrick discovers that the idea of whisking her to safety is quickly put to rest when the social worker tells him that the us will not let him adopt and although it takes five minutes to save a child it takes five years to reintegrate her into society patrick is not affected by the information and he continues his quest to find holly the audience is then shown that holly makes it to a small town and is foraging for food with other homeless children she is then befriended by a local policemen who seem little better than criminals with a badge when they sell her to another brothel and then make a deal to a vietnamese businessman who then takes her virginity holly then seems to think that this is her destiny and when patrick finally find her she is willing to yum yum and boom boom her distant friend patrick is utterly confused by this change in behavior but he is not deterred in his plan to take her away from this world in the end he steals her away and brings her to a safe land in the comfort of the social worker holly is given fresh clothes if feed and brought to a dance class but she is forbidden to see patrick this intense yearning to be in the comfort of patrick s friendship she runs away from the safe house and back onto the streets in cambodia meanwhile patrick is dealing with the decision to leave the country and flee back to the united states or to stay in cambodia his thoughts continue to revert back to holly and during a visit to a bar an older male sees the picture he is holding and comments on his sexual appetite when he had sex with her this enrages patrick and he hits the man and runs out of the bar eventually patrick is caught by the police in the eyes of holly who is hiding behind a pole the movie holly may make the audience want to donate money towards organizations that improve the life for these poor youngsters and even campaign to reduce the amount of brothels in the region but the film s dramatic weaknesses may reduce its chances of being seen by enough people to make a difference overall i think the concept is better as a documentary and it was not as touching as a movie the actors did a great job of showing their raw emotion and the true confusion of the youngsters who are affected by this lifestyle but in the end the harsh lifestyle of the region and the desperate notions of the parents who sell their children to uphold their own starvation does nothing to help the children s situations
this is one of the greatest films i have ever seen i glowed inside throughout the whole film the music and cinematography held the spell when little was happening on screen the slow pace was set by the mode of travel a riding lawn mower with a big trailer and was maintained by the background sights and sounds and the slow paced lives of the other characters the story actually happened alvin straight died in at the age of there was no acting everything was completely real as if the actors had actually transformed into the characters sissy spacek gave a poignant performance as a somewhat disabled daughter who had suffered much but forged ahead always wanting to do the right thing richard farnsworth was cast perfectly and he beautifully became alvin straight a stubborn but loving elderly man who treks across iowa to visit his estranged brother lyle who has had a stroke alvin had learned much wisdom during his life and that seemed to bring out the best in the people that he encountered along the way the film underscores the importance of family to this man and hopefully to all of us i eagerly anticipate seeing it again and again directed by david lynch this films proves his directorial skill farnsworth was nominated for an academy award for best actor at he was the oldest nominee ever for that award
i recently had the pleasure of seeing the big bad swim at the ft lauderdale film festival and i must say it is the best film i have seen all year and the only film i have ever felt inspired to write a comment review on this film was beautifully directed and combined a script with realistic dialogs excellent acting and an inspiring message ordinary lives come together in an adult swim class and become extraordinary in a celebration of the diversity of life this is poignantly illustrated by the imagery in the first minute of this captivating film where we see only the legs and torso of individuals in various shapes and sizes enter into a pool of water this film is brilliantly directed as the actors are placed and positioned in captivating scenes which hold your attention and imagination
there are few movies that appear to provide enterntainment as well as realism if you ve ever wondered about the role of snipers in modern war take a look at this one i just loved the scene where hundred soldiers get shooting at the jungle no one quite sure where that shot came and they nicked one scene to saving private ryan so it has to have some merit in the scene
atlantis is probally the best disney movie that i have seen in years it has great action scene magic an intelligent and weel written script atlantis brings back the magic of the disney classics such as the lion king or alladin after seeing this one i m sure that this year summer blockbusters season will be great i recommend to you all alantis the lost empire is like a breath of inspiration out of

this film is definitely an odd love story though this film may not be much to shout about nicole kidman carries the film on her own the rest of the cast could quite easily be forgotten though ben chaplin does do quite a good job of hertfordshire life with shots of st albans hemel hempstead town centre depicting the true essence of the area what starts outlooking like a regular episode of the popular british tv series heartbeat soon turns into a gritty gangster getaway action flick nothing truly memorable happens in this simple small film and thus ends up as fairly decent weekend entertainment a good one to watch and if you like the hero john are lonely thirty something you may find something to identify with in his character
should this be an american movie i d rate it we ve seen this before being this an argentinean movie and being myself argentine i d like to give it a since it s the kind of quality i d been hoping rather than expecting for it s superb quality is astonishing given all the limitations imposed by the rd world i can t forget the scene when d az forces silverstein s fianc to confess you know what i mean if you saw the movie i think that s the key moment of the movie not surprising maybe yet original that s when the real action begins before watching a movie i always try to gather some previous information being this a mainstream satyric commercial one i press play and make a suspension of reality and logic i d say the best state of mind to enjoy movies like this it s impossible to discuss the plausibility of the whole plot yet it s believable in a certain way as for me i couldn t stop laughing at every single joke and commentary sos malo you re mean put in the mouth of d az the greatest one i m rather tired of seeing movies designed for peretti i know he s a superb actor but sometimes i feel his roles unfairly opaque the rest luis luque s role in this case i m not very fond of argentine television so i haven t seen much work from luque but it s pretty obvious that he s an excellent performer his physical role his stares his content attitude in this movie made me fall in love with his performance i think his role should need some upgrading just to let him show us how great he can be i don t know whether szifr n is planning to make a sequel or not i know he won t make it if it s to follow the rule that second parts were never good so if he makes it i ll surely go see it and i hope that in the future takes into account the possibility to give peretti s counterparts the same chances to develop their roles great movie great performances and lots of laughs
soylent green is a classic i have been waiting for someone to re do it they seem to be remaking sci fi classics these days i e war of the worlds and i am hoping some director producer will re do soylent green with todays computer animation and technology it would have the potential to be a great picture anti utopian films may not be that far fetched the human race breeds like roaches with no outside influence to curtail it we as humans have the option of putting the kibosh on the procreation of lesser species if they get out of hand but there s nothing to control human breeding except for ourselves despite all the diseases wars abortions birth control etc the human race still multiplies like bacteria in a petri dish classic malthusian economics states that any species including humans will multiply beyond their means of subsistence billion and growing that s obscene
child sexploitation is one of the most serious issues facing our world today and i feared that any film on the topic would jump straight to scenes of an explicitly sexual nature in order to shock and disturb the audience after having seen both trade and holly one film moved me to want to actually see a change in international laws the other felt like a poor attempt at making me cry for five minutes with emotive music and the odd suicide i do not believe that turning this issue into a hollywood tear jerker is a useful or necessary strategy to adopt and i must commend the makes of holly for engaging subtly but powerfully with the terrible conditions these children are sadly forced to endure trade wavered between serious and stupid with scenes involving the death of a cat coming after images that represented children being forced to commit some horrendous acts i found this unengaging and at times offensive to the cause if i had wanted a cheap laugh i would not have signed up for a film on child trafficking for anyone who would like to watch a powerful film that actually means something i would suggest saving the money on the cinema ticket for the release of holly
prof janos rukh boris karloff discovers radium x a powerful force to be used for atomic power unfortunately rukh has been contaminated by the radium and starts to glow in the dark and his touch causes instant death dr felix benet bela lugosi develops an antidote but rukh starts to go mad due to the radium and the antidote and sets out to kill all he believed wronged him the plot is silly and the effects that make karloff glow in the dark are laughable but this is still a fun little chiller it moves quickly has some great atmosphere notice rukh s house and the movie starts on a dark and rainy night and karloff and lugosi as always give great performances there is also good acting by franic drake as rukh s wife and violet kemble cooper as his mother so it s ok but just a notch below all the other karloff lugosi movies the plot is just too far fetched for me to swallow still i did like this i give it a
i can t believe it s been ten years since this show first aired on tv and delighted viewers with its unique mixture of comedy and horror this is the show that gave birth to a good part of modern british humor dr terrible s house of horrible garth marenghi s darkplace the mighty boosh snuff box many have imitated this show s style and i don t deny some have surpassed its quality but jermy dyson deserves being remembered for having started the trend with actors mark gatiss steve pemberton and reece shearsmith together they created royston vasey a sinister small town in england s idyllic countryside where unsuspecting tourists and passers by come across an obsessive couple that wants to keep the town local and free of strangers where the unemployed are abused and insulted at the job center where a farmer uses real people as scarecrows where a vet kills all the animals he tries to cure where a gypsy circus kidnaps people and where the butcher adds something secret but irresistible to the food to hook people on this is just a whiff of what the viewer can find in the league of gentlemen by themselves the three actors give birth to dozens and dozens of unique characters the make up and prosthetics are so good i actually thought i watching a lot more actors on the show than there were but it s also great acting the way they change their voices and their body movement the really become other people most of the jokes start with something ordinary from real life and then blows up into something unsettling sometimes gut wrenching sometimes it s pure horror without a set up like in papa lazarou s character just imagine a creepy circus owner on make up barging into someone s house and kidnapping women to be his wives no explanation given it s that creepy then there are the numerous references to horror movies se en the silence of the lambs nosferatu the exorcist etc fans of horror will love it fans of comedy will love it as any traveler entering knows there s a sign there that says welcome to royston vasey you ll never leave any viewer who gives this show a chance will agree once you discover the league of gentlemen you ll never want anything else you ll never forget it
this film is more about how children make sense of the world around them and how they and we use myth to make sense of it all i think it s been misperceived everyone going in expecting a stalkfest won t enjoy it but if you want a deeper story it s here
the photography was beautiful but i had difficulty understanding what was happening was there a lot of symbolism the goldfishes do they mean something in thai culture there s not much plot not much happens and it just meanders along no real start no real middle and no real end rather unsatisfying really it was difficult to get into the characters as you never felt you got to know them it was difficult to know which scenes were imaginary and which were real the move felt chaotic and disjointed i don t know what the pang brothers were hoping to achieve maybe if i were thai it would make more sense
this was the third muppet movie and the last one jim henson was around to take part in the making of before his premature death in the first three films starring the famous characters were all made and released into theatres before i was born i originally saw the first and second installments in the original trilogy the muppet movie and the great muppet caper around the mid nineties as a kid but didn t see this third one the muppets take manhattan until april this was shortly after i had seen its two predecessors and s muppet treasure island for the first time in many years this third muppet movie definitely didn t disappoint me the first time i saw it and my second viewing nearly three years later may not have impressed me as much but if not it certainly didn t go too far downhill the muppets stage musical manhattan melodies turns out to be a big hit on their college campus they are graduating from college so they will soon be leaving but decide they will all stay together and go to manhattan to try and get their show on broadway after their arrival they begin searching for a producer but after many rejections they finally decide to part and go find jobs most of them leave town but kermit stays and is still determined to find the right producer and reunite the muppet gang he gets a job at a new york restaurant owned by a man named pete the frog quickly befriends pete s daughter jenny an aspiring fashion designer who currently works at her father s restaurant as a waitress as kermit continues his attempts to reach stardom now with the help of jenny he doesn t know that miss piggy has secretly stayed in new york and is now spying on him she begins to see kermit and jenny together and to her it looks like they re getting close which leads to jealousy when i saw this movie for the second time it looked disappointing at first it seemed a little rushed unfocused and maybe even forgettable around the beginning there are some funny bits during this part of the film such as animal chasing a woman through the audience on the college campus but for a little while the film seemed bland to me compared to its two predecessors fortunately it wasn t long before that changed the film is entertaining for the most part with saying goodbye the poignant song the muppets sing as they part and a lot that happens after that the two funniest parts might be miss piggy s tantrums after she sees kermit and jenny hugging but there were definitely many other times when i laughed such as poor fozzie trying to hibernate with other bears the muppets still have their charm and comical antics which obviously also helps carry the movie for the most part as does the plot a simple but intriguing one for all ages there are some weaker moments such as the muppet babies sequence and juliana donald s performance as jenny is lacklustre but neither of these problems are too significant and are far from enough to ruin the entire experience i would say the muppet movie the film that started the franchise in is the best of the original trilogy and that seems to be the most popular opinion this third film is probably the weakest of the three but all of them are good unlike muppets from space the third of the theatrical films in the franchise made after henson s sad passing at least the muppets take manhattan is still the muppets i won t go into details about what i think of the muppets film released twenty years after their first one since i ve already explained in my review of it why i found it so disappointing and even though it does have some appeal i m clearly not alone however every theatrical movie starring the lovable muppets that was made during henson s life is good entertainment for the whole family even if the second and third installment each showed a slight decline in quality after the one that directly preceded it
this was a must see documentary for me when i missed the opportunity in so i was definitely going to watch the repeat i really sympathised with the main character of the film because this is true i have a milder condition of the skin problem he had dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa eb this is a sad sometimes amusing and very emotional documentary about a boy with a terrible skin disorder jonny kennedy speaks like a kid because of wasting vocal muscle and never went through puberty but he is years old most sympathising moments are seeing his terrible condition and pealing off his bandages jonny had quite a naughty sense of humour he even narrated from beyond the grave when showing his body in a coffin he tells his story with the help of his mother edna kennedy his older brother and celebrity model and jonny s supporter nell mcandrew it won the baftas for best editing and best new director factual and it was nominated for best sound factual and the flaherty documentary award it was number on the greatest tv treats a must see documentary
this was one of the most moving movies i have ever seen i was about years old when i watched it for the first time and whenever it is on tv i my eyes are glued to it the acting and plot are amazing it seems so true to reality and it touches on so many controversial topics i recommend this movie to anyone interested in a good drama
i don t know if i d consider it a masterpiece of not but it s damn near close it s extremely well made artistic suspenseful intricately plotted thematically challenging and full of bleak foreshadowing and sexual religious imagery there s also some great camera work from jan de bont an atmospheric score from loek dikker and outstanding acting from jeroen krabb and ren e soutendijk the latter giving one of the most sneaky subtle femme fatale performance i ve ever seen like many other european movies this movie has an unashamed non judgmental attitude toward sex nudity and the complexities of sexuality and has zero reservations about mixing it all up with religious and or surrealistic some would say blasphemous images in other words if you can t bear the thought of seeing a lust driven homosexual envisioning the object of his carnal desire as jesus crucified on the cross before the two of them go at it inside a cemetery crypt then this might not be the movie for you what surprised me more is how this bizarre movie managed to completely dodge being a pretentious mess it mixes the abstract surreal parallel fantasy reality scenes and somehow makes it all work like any good mystery you can see the pieces slowly falling into place as the movie progresses there is not an out of left field resolution here the movie has direction there s no needless filler and once it concludes you begin to understand the purpose of what may have confused you earlier if you like the work of ken russell and david lynch i can almost guarantee you will love this movie hell if you have no idea who they even are you still might like it i m not going to spoil the plot by getting too detailed but the film s opening shot through a web as a spider catches its prey sets the stage as krabb as unshaven smug bisexual writer gerard reve interestingly also the name of the writer whose novel this is based on crosses paths with a wealthy mysterious sexy woman named christine soutendijk melding androgynous stylings with simone simon like innocence cuteness that s pretty unnerving who may be a literal black widow responsible for the deaths of her three previous husbands the two become lovers and move in with one another but we re led to believe through christine s bizarre behavior and the frequent appearances of another woman played by geert de jong who may or may not actually exist something terrible is boiling under the surface when another of christine s lovers the young and beautiful herman thom hoffman shows up at the house things take an unexpected turn and that s all you need to know the th man was a huge art house success in much of the world but didn t make it over to the us until where it was awarded the best foreign film of the year from the los angeles film critics association the most common video is the media release which has been horribly dubbed try to avoid that one and head straight for the newer subtitled anchor bay dvd release since coming to america verhoeven s career has had its ups and downs he has made a few decent films flesh blood robocop and some lousy ones showgirls in fact verhoeven s big hit basic instinct is almost like a less interesting junior league version of the fourth man soutendjik also tried her hand at acting in america and since grave secrets and eve of destruction were the best offers she was getting she headed right back home to the netherlands
first off this is an excellent series though we have sort of a james bond effect what i mean is that while the new casino royale takes place in it is chronologically the first adventure of dr no being the second while in golden eye the first film with pierce brosnan judi dench is referred to as the new replacement for the male m so how could she have been in place in the beginning before bond became a double aside from the fact that she is obviously years older this is more or less a poetic license to thrill we need to turn our heads aside a bit if we wish to be entertained no the new star trek movie does not have any of the primitive electronics of the original series from nearly half a century ago in the s communicators were fantasy now we call them cell phones and there were sliding levers instead of buttons omg do you think years from now they would have perfected rogaine for jean luc picard so please let s give the producers some leeway but to try and make things a bit consistent let us just ponder about the cylons creation just years prior to the end of battlestar galactica if that is the case where did all the cylons that populated the original earth come from we know that the technology exists for spontaneous jumps through space well what happened if one of the cyclon ships at war with the caprica fleet was fired upon or there was a sunspot or whatever and one ship loaded with human looking cylons wound up not only jumping through space but through time back a thousand or ten thousand years with a crippled ship near earth one they colonized it found out they could repopulate it and eventually destroyed themselves but not before they themselves sent out a ragtag fleet to search for the legendary caprica only to find a habitable but unpopulated planet which they colonized to become the humans who eventually invented the cylons time paradox of course which came first the chicken or the road who cares it s fraking entertaining
i must admit a slight disappointment with this film i had read a lot about how spectacular it was yet the actual futuristic sequences the age of science take up a very small amount of the film the sets and are excellent when we get to them and there are some startling images but this final sequence is lacking in too many other regards much the best drama of the piece is in the mid section and then it plays as melodrama arising from the high concept science fiction nature of it all and insufficiently robust dialogue there is far more human life in this part though with the great ralph richardson sailing gloriously over the top as the small dictator the boss of the everytown i loved richardson s mannerisms and curt delivery of lines dismissing the presence and ideas of raymond massey s aloof confident visitor this boss is a posturing convincingly deluded figure unable to realise the small fry nature of his kingdom it s not a great role yet richardson makes a lot of it everytown itself is presumably meant to be england or at least an english town fairly representative of england interesting was the complete avoidance of any religious side to things the things to come seem to revolve around a conflict between warlike barbarism and a a faith in science that seems to have little ultimate goal but to just go on and on there is a belated attempt to raise some arguments and tensions in the last section concerning more personal life yet one is left quite unsatisfied the film hasn t got much interest in subtle complexities it goes for barnstorming spectacle and unsubtle blunt moralism every time and of course recall the hedged bet finale raymond massey waxing lyrical about how uncertain things are concerning the question of the film being a prediction i must say it s not at all bad as such considering that one obviously allows that it is impossible to gets the details of life anything like right the grander conceptions have something to them a war in well that was perhaps predictable lasting nearly years mind a nuclear bomb the super gun or some such contraption in a technocratic socialist we don t believe in independent nation states type government in britain after hmmm sadly nowhere near on that one chaps no real politics are gone into here which is a shame all that surfaces is a very laudable anti war sentiment generally it is assumed that dictatorship whether boneheaded luddite fascist as under the boss or all hands to the pump scientific socialism will be the deal and these implications are not broached while we must remember that in there was no knowledge at all of how nazism and communism would turn out or even how they were turning out the lack of consideration of this seems meek beside the scope of the filmmakers vision on other matters much of the earlier stuff should and could have been cut in my opinion only the briefest stuff from would have been necessary yet this segment tends to get rather ponderous and it is ages before we get to the richardson massey parts i would have liked to have seen more done with margareta scott who is just a trifle sceptical cutting a flashing eyed mediterranean figure to negligible purpose the character is not explored or frankly explained or exploited except for one scene which i shall not spoil and her relationship with the boss isn t explored but then this was the s and there was such a thing as widespread institutional censorship back then edward chapman is mildly amusing in his two roles more so in the first as a hapless chap praying for war only to be bluntly put down by another massey character massey himself helps things a lot playing his parts with a mixture of restraint and sombre gusto contrasting well with a largely diffident cast save for richardson and scott and chapman slightly i would say that things to come is undoubtedly a very extraordinary film to have been made in britain in one of the few serious british science fiction films to date indeed its set piece design and harnessing of resources are ravenous marvellous yet the script is ultimately over earnest and at times all over the place the direction is prone to a flatness though it does step up a scenic gear or two upon occasion the cinematographer and mr richardson really do salvage things however respectively creating an awed sense of wonder at technology and an engaging jerky performance that consistently beguiles such a shame there is so little substance or real filmic conception to the whole thing powell and pressburger would have been the perfect directors to take on such a task as this they are without peer among british directors as daring visual storytellers great helmsmen of characters and dealers in dialogue of the first rate things to come as it stands is an intriguing oddity well worth perusing yet far short of a metropolis tis much as silly in wells words as that lang film yet with nothing like the astonishing force of it
there s something about every hammer movie i see that really takes me into a new fantasy world in the world of hammer movies anything can happen guardian of the abyss is one of those types of movies it adventures deep into the occult and hypnosis to bring a different type of horror fantasy all in all an unforgettable movie
an hilariously accurate caricature of trying to sell a script documentary hits all the beats plot points character arcs seductions moments of elation and disappointments and the allure but insane prospect of selling a script or getting an agent in hollywood and all the fleeting fantasy realizing but ultimately empty rites of passage attendant to being socialized into the system hotz and rice capture the moment of thinking you re finally a player only to find that what goes up comes down fast and in a blind siding fashion that for inexplicable reasons hollywood has moved on and left you checking your heart your dreams and your pockets pitch is a must see for students in film school to taste the mind and ego bashing gantlet that is for most the road that must be traveled to sell oneself and one s projects in hollywood if your teacher or guru has never been there they can t tell you what you need to prepare for this gantlet to enter the biz talent is necessary but far from sufficient
i don t think anyone besides terrence malick and maybe tran anh hung makes cinema on a purer level than claire denis that said i don t love this her newest film quite as much as her masterpiece trouble every day although it comes very close which itself is one of my absolute favorite films it it only because the narrative here is possibly slightly too elliptical for it s own good don t get me wrong the fact that this film barely has a plot at all is really one of the best things about it but i think denis took it about one degree farther than it needed to go and consequently the film does flirt with incomprehensibility and a few key plot points should have been clarified somehow like that the main character goes to south korea to get his heart transplant instead of just showing him there all of a sudden without any explanation of where he is or why he is there also some of the other characters seemed unnecessary and as if they were just excuses for denis to use actors she likes yet again beatrice dalle s character in particular is a little distracting because you keep expecting that she is going to have some significance still the film is incredibly absorbing and the cinematography is beyond amazing it is definitely very much a masterpiece in it s own way at least as good as denis more highly acclaimed beau travail if not better claire denis has to be my favorite french director at this point better than leos carax even also i have to admit that the south korean sequence really does do lost in translation better than that film itself does and i unlike some am a huge fan of that film as well
a very enjoyable film providing you know how to watch old musicals mysteries it may not come close to agatha christie or even thin man mysteries as a film noir but it s much more interesting than your typical boy meets girl or let s put on a show backstage musical as a musical it s no busby berkley or freed unit but it can boost the classic coctails for two and the weird sweet marijuana the film runs in real time during a stage show opening night of the vanities where a murder and soon another is discovered backstage is the murderer found out before the curtain falls sure but the search is fun even though somewhat predictable and marred by outbursts of comic relief luckily in the shape of the shapely goddess of the chorus girls toby wing the stupid cop is just a bit too stupid the leading hero is just a bit too likable the leading lady a bit too gracious the bitchy prima donna bit too bitchy and the enamoured waif a bit too self sacrificing but as stereotypes go they are pretty stylish there s a bevy of really gorgeous chorus girls who are chosen even better than the girls for a busby berkley musical of the same period who sometimes tend to be a bit on the plump side yes this film could have been much better than it is and the duke ellington number is an embarrassment but if you enjoy diving into old movies this will prove to be a tremendously tantalizing trip
since siskel s death and ebert s absence the show has been left in the incapable hands of richard roeper roeper is not a film critic he just criticizes anything he doesn t like personally i e films with country music get panned because i don t like country music and children s movies get a standard don t see it now wait until it comes out on dvd and rent it for your kids roeper may well be an idiot savant but in some other field the weekly guests sitting in for ebert fare better but who wants to pick a daisy in the midst of a cow pat all that said it is the only show in town and that alone makes it worth watching as for roger ebert if stephen hawking can talk so can you it s your mind and thoughts we long for do whatever is necessary to get that usurper off his self declared throne
the film revolves around a man who believes that all forms of media are obsolete the idea behind his art project is to unmask the ridiculous culture that we are bathed in naturally the film takes place in los angeles orange county he attacks stand up comics caw caw caw rock bands models blockbuster hollywood films and touches on many other mediums eventually he finds himself in the sights of the weapon he has set into motion the film is five years old and rings more true every day it s the best description of post punk anger i ve ever seen it s also one of my top favorite films
i caught this film late on a sat night sunday morning with my brother we had been drinking this is one of the best films for ripping apart i have ever seen from the luxury ocean liner actually being a roll on roll off ferry complete with cast iron everything to the doors with adhesive stickers saying staff then seeing the same door being used for something else in another scene this film rocks the continuity is so poor you cant help but notice it it slaps you in the face with the holes in the final scene he jumps off a life boat with the ferry in the distance cut to his son and new girlfriend the ships pr director who knows kung fu and used to be in the police but was dismissed for doing things her way true on the ferry going very fast away from the explosion then the dad is there hugging them how who cares its magic there is not one redeeming feature to this film the casino is the size of a large bedroom with one casino table when being chased by the villains there is only one place to hide you ve guessed it enter the villains who instead of checking under the one table proceed to shoot up four fruit machines and a little corner bar a corner bar in the casino fantastic they walk straight past the only hiding place thus allowing our casper to get around them and take them out get some mates over get a few drinks in put this film on and howl
off the blocks let me just say that i am a huge zombie fan so i don t make statements like the above lightly secondly let me say that this is an italian zombie film and fulci only directed minutes of it before handing over to bruno rats night of terror mattei this is no dawn of the dead folks that said this is easily one of the most entertaining zombie films i have ever seen the script is wonderfully horrible just check out the two scientists trying to find an antidote let s try putting these two molecules together the zombies come in all varieties from moaning shufflers to machete wielding maniacs to birds the gore is plentiful legs are bitten off arms amputated stomachs burst open the pace is fast flying from one zombie attack to the next then there s the head in the fridge oh the head in the fridge one of the greatest moments in horror since ash got his hand possessed in evil dead you should know already whether you re the sort of person who s going to like this sort of film get some mates and some beer and you ll be in for a fun night did i mention the head in the fridge
this film needs to be seen the truest picture of what is going on in the world that i ve seen since darwin s nightmare go see it and if you re lucky enough to have it open in your city be sure to see it on the big screen instead of dvd the writing is sharp and the direction is good enough for the ideas to come through though hardly perfect joan cusack is amazing and the rest of the cast is good too it s inspiring that john cusack got this movie made and i believe he had to use some of his own money to do it it s a wild absurd ride obviously made without the resources it needed but still succeeds jon stewart steven colbert snl even bill maher haven t shown the guts to say what this film says
as a biographical film the lady with red hair the story of how director producer playwright david belasco transformed notorious society divorcee mrs leslie carter into an international stage star is certainly not in a league with that other warner s biopic of similar vintage yankee doodle dandy what is but lady is an enjoyable film in its own right and shares quite a few traits in common with the cagney classic like yankee doodle dandy the lady with red hair brims over with old time show business flavor among other things both films feature delicious theatrical boarding house sequences as well as the inevitable scenes set backstage and in theatrical managers offices also in lady as in the cohan biopic the supporting cast is made up of familiar and beloved character actors of the period all doing the sort of top notch work we remember them for need i add that again like yankee doodle dandy the lady with red hair doesn t let the truth get in the way of telling a good story but also like dandy lady does manage gloriously to convey the esssence of its show business giant hero s larger than life personality everyone knows that cagney limned cohan for all time in his brilliant and affectionate portrayal in yankee doodle dandy but few moviegoers realize that claude rains did a similar service for david belasco in the lady with red hair and did it with a panache that almost equals cagney s rains as belasco perfectly captures that legendary showman s galvanic personality in all its outsized glory rains gives a tremendously enjoyable superbly observed and remarkably true to life performance as the man all broadway once called the wizard to watch claude rains in action looking in every shot as if he s having a helluva good time in the lady with red hair is to see david belasco leap to life on film as if he can t wait to shake things up on the main stem once again
panic delivers the goods ten fold with oscar caliber performances from william h macy neve campbell and donald sutherland in a movie about the choices we make and the consequences we live with chillingly honest and thought provoking panic is easily one of the best film to come out of hollywood in years the impact stays with you right after you leave the theater
what a wonderful fanciful movie stardust is i could easily end it with that one statement and suffice to say one could take it as a very strong recommendation to go see it at a time when hollywood seems bent on forcing remakes and sequels down our throats stardust makes us remember why we go to the movies in the first place to escape reality for a couple of hours and explore other lives other times or other planets ironically stardust takes us to all three places effortlessly and with a childlike glee we all long for stardust is full of all the characters we remember as children princes witches pirates ghosts and scoundrels it has the damsel in distress the hero the rogues the obstacles spells antidotes charms and even a touch of light speed to make it quasi modern stardust is about a man from the town of wall which is conveniently situated next to a wall that separates their town from a magical kingdom the only way past the wall is through a breech that is diligently guarded by a scruffy old codger played wonderfully by david kelly one day a young man from wall named ben barnes out maneuvers the old guard and escapes through the breech he happens upon an enchanted kingdom called stormhold where he meets a chained and very sexy young lady named una she is held captive by a witch and leashed by an unbreakable chain while the witch is away una seduces ben and sends him on his way ben returns to wall without incident and continues his life but nine months later he is summoned to the wall breech where the old guard hands him what you might expect a baby boy the boy named tristan grows up to be a rather hapless young man charlie cox who is smitten with a girl way out of his league and also betrothed to another nevertheless the young lady named victoria and played sienna miller goes out once with tristain and he confesses his love to her after they espy a falling star she tells him he can have her if he retrieves the star and brings it back to her he agrees and sets out on his quest which will take him to the other side of the wall meanwhile in the kingdom of stormhold the old king perfectly played by peter o toole is dying he calls his remaining living sons to tell them who shall succeed him to the throne his sons names are primus secondus sextmus and septimus the other sons where killed by the other brothers in a humorous competition to see who lives to get the throne anyway he tosses his ruby charm to the sky and voila that what brings the star to earth the star crashes in the form of a beautiful woman named yvaine clare danes and she of course is wearing the charm but little does she know she is now being persuaded by tristain the princes and also an aging witch named lamia michelle pfeiffer who wants to cut out the stars heart to regain her own youth complicated yes but it all comes together as the adventure unfolds tristain is the first to find yvaine but is so blinded by his devotion to victoria he doesn t recognize the growing bond between he and yvaine his initial interest lie only in returning yvaine to victoria as proof of his love but he must get past the princes and lamia first the princes aren t that big an issue as they are constantly trying to kill each other and just as in pirates of the caribbean never has death been so funny but tristain also encounters the witch who enslaved his mother though he doesn t know it s his mother and a band of flying pirates led by robert deniro his is the most important character in the movie and deniro plays it to a tee he steals the movie with his toughness and soon we learn an undercover secret that will leave audiences on the floor with laughter though his role is small in length deniro is extraordinary michelle pfeiffer is wonderful as lamia a sexy evil witch claire danes is most appropriate as the confused and distressed yvaine she makes a perfect damsel jason flemyng adam buston rupert everett and mark strong add the perfect dose of levity as the fighting princes whom as they die return as ghosts ala blithe spirit and high spirits moreover director matthew vaughn whose only other directing experience was layer cake weaves an enchanting tale that everyone will enjoy stardust may be too complex for young children but anyone over the age of will want to see this movie multiple times it s that good stardust is what movies are supposed to be perfectly written perfectly cast perfectly directed and perfectly acted in other words perfect
the story is quite original but the movie is kinda slow building up to the point where they steal the cars its kinda nice though to watch them prepare the stealing too but the actual stealing should ve been more in picture however the stunt work on this movie was excellent and it is definetly a movie you have to see
convoluted infuriating and implausible fay grim is hard to sit through but parker posey is really the only actress who could take this story and run with it she s at once touching funny cunning the supporting actors commit to it as well i wont even try to tell you the plot it involves characters from hartley s henry fool and attempts a tale of international espionage the film works well if you continue along with it understanding it is in a sense completely ridiculous it becomes more and more ridiculous as you plod along i resisted the temptation to turn off the dvd twice fay grim requires an adventurous film goer willing to tackle something that isn t cookie cutter in the end it offers something that defies description
this is simply a classic film where the human voices coming from the animals are really what they re thoughts are i don t know whether my video copy has a scene missing but it never shows how the dogs got out of the pit it also shows an animals survival instinct and tracking abilities put humans in the same position ant the helicopters would be out for once an original film is improved by a remake as the voice over for the first has been removed only the use of animals can work in a film of this kind because using people would have had to spice out the story by turning it into murder proving that after all animals are more interesting than people
two years passed and mostly everyone looks different some for good and some for worse i still enjoyed as much as i did the original though some flaws they had though like changing the joker he now has no red lips and looks like more blackish hair and black pupils hes still voiced by mark hamill which is a plus i guess they made poison ivy more white hinting that she is becoming more like a plant and catwomen looks much different and not as attractive as she was in the original though costumes like batman batgirl killer croc and scarecrow look badass especially scarecrow the show isn t as dark as the original because batman doesn t work as alone as he used to most of the time working with batgirl and the new robin tim drake while nightwing dick grayson comes to the rescue often batman gave up the yellow logo and with the black wing on his suit and seems like he got a bit bigger but still kicking tons of ass the show isn t as good as the original mostly because of some of the revamped characters but the stories are as exciting as ever and the dialogue is still elite over the edge might be one of the greatest batman episodes ever so make sure you check that out overall
i had really only been exposed to olivier s dramatic performances and those were mostly much later films than divorce in this film he is disarmed of his pomp and overconfidence by sassy merle oberon and plays the flustered divorce attorney with great charm
they were always trying to get me killed alec guinness once wrote of the man in the white suit s technicians they thought actors got in the way of things he went on to describe how he d been given a wire rope to climb down and assured it was safe narrowly avoided serious injury when it suddenly snapped mid descent people get in the way of things might be a maxim tailor made for white suit inventor sidney stratton fittingly played blank slate fashion by alec guinness in alexander mackendrick s definitive ealing film of certainly he cares only about his work its realisation and sod the consequences and similarly with the exception of a couple of peripheral characters there s almost nobody to root for in this chilly satire on capital and labour told in flashback the film concerns stratton s invention of a dirt resistant everlasting fibre fashioned into the white suit of the title and subsequent attempts by the clothing industry and its unions to suppress it while the industry fears the bottom will drop out of the market the shop floor stewards worry about finding themselves out of a job abduction and bribery attempts follow with both money and an industry chief s daughter on offer daphne the delectable packs a day voiced joan greenwood to the tragi comic end what s to become of my bit of washing when there s no washing to do bemoans stratton s landlady near the close a notion stratton hadn t even considered and has disregarded again by the movie s ambiguous coda a superior if decidedly downbeat comedy expertly performed and pretty much answering the oft raised question of whatever happened to the everlasting light bulb and the car that ran on water
i m not usually a fan of strictly romantic movies but heard this was good i was stunned easily the most romantic thing i ve ever seen in my life stunning brilliant sweet funny and full of heart the chemistry is flawless as is the writing and directing ethan hawke and julie delphy are so natural and sweet together you really think they re a couple the movies grabs you right away and doesn t let go you can t look away nor can you stop listening to them even the little moments just melt your heart this has jumped into the ranks of one of my favourite ever a masterpiece
i was years old when this movie premiered on the television being raised in texas i understood the boredom monotony of teenage life there this movie touched my impressionable teenage heart i remembered it fondly through the past years i recently got to see it for the nd rd th times thanks the the love channel i still cry because the movie reaches in touches my inner confused teenager
for those who commented on the patriot as being accurate which basically satanised the english it was interesting to see this film by all accounts this was the bloodiest war that americans have ever been involved in and they were the only nationality present it was therefore very refreshing to see something resembling historical accuracy coming from that side of the atlantic that did not paint america as either martyrs or saviours all in all though what this film did bring home was the true horrors of any conflict and how how whatever acts are committed in war only breed worse acts often culminating in the suffering of the innocent this was not a film where you cheered anybody on but both pitied and loathed all
i loved dedee pfeiffer is that spelled right in cybil haven t seen her for awhile and forgot how much i missed her i thought she did a great job in this the supporting cast was pretty good too in some angles the daughter even looked like a young nicole kidman the abductor was pretty creepy and the story generally had some good twists the young boyfriend was a hottie i thought the husband definitely had something to do with it for sure just got the lifetime movie network for christmas and am loving these movies kept my interest and i ll watch it again when they rerun it can anyone else recommend any similar movies to this you can post on the board or send me a private email if you want thanks in advance aboutagirly
the story and the characters were some of the best i ve ever seen the graphics were good for the ps and the cut scenes and voice overs were amazing i beat the game at least times and loved every second of it i felt the problems the protagonist faced were believable and realistic and i believe it deserves a sequel or at least a remake if they remade it for the ps i would buy the system for just that game and maybe mgs its amazing also the idea and execution of the dragoon system is enough to warrant a rental and on top of that ad the inventive although sometimes cheating stupid buster wand combat addition system and the plot makes this game a definite buy
there is not much more i can say about this movie than all of the commentaries on page one except as jesse says it s the berries all of page one s commentators wrote eloquently as almost so as the dialog is in this movie this just may be one of those illusive things we hear so much about but usually are made so by the actors who deliver the lines a beautiful script maybe robert redford did hold strict sway onto the actors actresses during the filming of this movie so that the beauty of the story would not get lost i too attended church when i was very young and into my late teens the church s pastor spoke very eloquently and quietly as the rev maclean did in his church that in itself is a totally different picture that is portrayed of southern baptist churches no holy rollering in my church it was a big church with many different programs to keep its congregation busy the most inspiring perhaps was the music department with its huge choir and almost classical anthems too the sunday evening congregation was almost entirely younger people are you even aware it was once safe to go to church on sunday night how i wish it still was watching a river runs through it is very much like going to hear a beautiful sermon in a church whose members are fully involved in life as has already been so beautifully written the sermon for this movie is the open space beauties of montana yet aren t there also missile silos there too fly fishing or any other activity which draws family members closer together for a happy life and deep understanding of one another becomes a blessing although you see some of the shadier aspects of life then too the simplicity of the story paints a lasting impression on your heart if you let it speakeasies and prostitutes are counter balanced by the simple gatherings of old fashioned community picnics as this movie contains in heavy contrasts to modern families taking their kids to disney land for screeching joyrides and calling it a day together there is noting wrong with that but as river demonstrates some of its taciturn beauty could do nothing but make life richer this is the third film i ve seen in which tom skeritt plays a father all different styles and brilliantly acted brad pitt mostly an undiscovered talent except for thelma and louise and meet joe black and all of the cast members deserved many awards little stories superbly told will get of from me over any movie with violence foul language ugliness and action i am thinking particularly of crash and most of arnold s movies what a savior for peace this movie is
sure the history in this movie was hollywoodized but it s far from being the only bit of history rewritten for the masses lafitte sided with the americans because he considered himself a frenchman and therefore hated the british not because of any sense of patriotism for a nation that had taken over new orleans only a short time ago he broke his agreement and returned to smuggling which caused his sailing to galveston he was more of a petty criminal and scoundrel than a hero or a swashbuckler but who cares this is one movie that s sheer entertainment and face it we all wanted jean to go for the feisty wench rather than the prudish daughter of the governor brynner once again rises over mediocre writing to give a fascinating performance
if you re a t rex marc bolan fan i recommend you check this out it shows a whimsical side of marc bolan as well as ringo starr apparently having a pretty good time shooting some of the scenes that aren t part of the concert but fun to watch leaving you with a sense of getting to know them as just people and when the concert is shown a talented musician both playful and professional that rocks and seems to impress the screaming girls watching him in concert you would never know that being a rock star is a job but just having a great time playing some great songs with some good friends like elton john and ringo starr appearing in some of the live performances true there are a few songs missing that i would like to have seen on there but like any album it can t have everything i just bought this in but if i would have know it came out in i would have definitely bought it years ago sad and strange that a man with so many songs about his love for cars would never learn to drive and would die in a car crash
forget the campy religious movies that have monopolized the television film market this movie has a real feel to it while it may be deemed as a movie that has cheap emotional draws it also has that message of forgiveness and overall good morals however i did not like the lighting in this movie for a movie dealing with such subject matter it was too bright i felt it took away from the overall appeal of the movie which is almost an unforgivable sin but the recognizable cast and their performances counteract this oversight definitely worth seeing buy the dvd
this is a great film esp when compared with the sometimes wearisome earnestness of today s politically minded filmmakers a film that can so easily combine sex gender relations politics and art is a rarity these days while the bouyant optimism of the s can t be regained i think we can at least learn a lesson from the film s breezy energy and charm i don t know what those who label the film boring were watching there s so much packed into it that it never remains the same film for more that min at a time
arthur is middle aged rich kid who drinks like a fish arthur does what he feels like and says whatever comes into his mind he likes to boast about his riches and knows that he is a spoiled brat he spends money on people he don t know and finds everything funny arthur must marry a high class girl to inherit a big fortune but he falls in love with a poor waitress liza minnelli she looks really weird this is a damn funny film i watched this film because a very famous indian film sharabee is based on the character of arthur although sharabee is definitely inspired by arthur i think they are two different films arthur is just fun its very corny at times there are so many fantastic one liners in the film its not a laugh riot but it has some fantastic moments my favorite scene is when arthur meets his fianc s father and he keeps talking about the moose duddley moore sure has some comic timing he is very good with words and body language i loved the scene where he talks standing to a seated couple in the hotel about a small country and he keeps talking to husband and wife in two different directions john gielgud got an oscar for this film i don t know that actor i don t think he did a great job but may be if i watched more of his work i may agree in future movie has some flat patches but not very long ones looking forward to watch the sequel
very rarely does one come across an indie comedy that leaves a lasting impression cross eyed is a rare gem the writer director not only tackled the challenge of directing his own work but gives a hilarious performance as an evil roommate the script takes an interesting look at not only the plight of the struggling writer but mixes so much comedy into the desolate world of the writer that you can t help but commit to ernie as a character very funny stuff despite the tiny budget adam jones manages to give the film a serious look he s not messing around when it comes to making a good movie i can t wait to see what he comes up with next this guy can make people laugh and think that s special
every time i watch this movie i am more impressed by the whole production i have come to the conclusion that it is the best romantic comedy ever made everyone involved is perfect script acting direction sets and editing whilst james stewart can always be relied upon for a good performance and the supporting cast are magnificent it is margaret sullavan who reveals what an underrated actress she was her tragic personal life give poignancy to her qualities as a performer where comedy acting skills are not easy to achieve lubitsch managed to get the best and he obviously gave his best watch for the number of scenes which were done on one take breathtaking
john boorman s deliverance concerns four suburban atlanta dwellers who take a ride down the swift waters of the cahulawassee the river is about to disappear for a dam construction and the flooding of the last untamed stretches of land the four friends emphasize different characters a virile sports enthusiast who has never been insured in his life since there is no specific risk in it burt reynolds a passionate family man and a guitar player ronny cox an overweight bachelor insurance salesman ned beatty and a quiet thoughtful married man with a son who loves to smoke his pipe jon voight what follows is the men s nightmarish explorations against the hostile violence of nature it is also an ideal code of moral principle about civilized men falling prey to the dark laws of the wilderness superbly shot this thrilling adult adventure certainly contains some genuinely gripping scenes
this movie is great entertainment to watch with the wife or girlfriend there are laughs galore and some very interesting little nudist stories going on here the actresses are all very interesting and definitely worth watching in their natural beauty maslin beach life is full of diverse nudists and personality types the australian coast scenery is simply splendid to see what a place to visit to say the least and one day it may become my hideaway i really enjoy this movie and every time i watch it i enjoy it more i would love to see more of these characters and i always wonder what became of them although the plot is somewhat soft this movie is of course a great excuse to just sit back on the couch and enjoy the wonderful and famous maslin beach with these wonderful nudists and their own personal stories
this is definitely an appropriate update for the original except that party on the left is now party on the right like the original this movie rails against a federal government which oversteps its bounds with regards to personal liberty it is a warning of how tenuous our political liberties are in an era of an over zealous and over powerful federal government kowalski serves as a metaphor for waco and ruby ridge where the us government with the cooperation of the mainstream media threw around words like white supremacist and right wing extremists as well as trumped up drug charges to abridge the most fundamental of its citizens rights with the willing acquiescence of the general populace that message is so non pc i am stunned that this film could be made at least not without bringing the federal government via the irs down on the makers like they did to juanita broderick katherine prudhomme the western journalism center and countless others who dared to speak out live free or die is the motto on jason priestly s hat as he brilliantly portrays the voice and that sums up the dangerous to some message of this film
jack frost is about a serial killer who is sentenced to death on the way to his death sentence the prison truck that he rides in collides with a chemical tanker filled with a chemical that turns his molecules with the snow on the ground turning him into a snowman being a killer himself that would turn him into a killer snowman jack now wants revenge on the sheriff who caught him jack now starts his rampage all over again killing people in a small town i don t think jack frost has a chance of becoming a horror classic but its a entertaining flick just put your brain on hold and have fun with it but just don t take it too seriously
the story is being told fluidly there are no interruptions the flash backs are woven into the present seamlessly casting was superb young ya ara looked very much like ya ara would have looked at that age her portrayal of a blind person was done convincingly director daniel syrkin have done a superb job in getting the various actors to work together in this story the cinematography is very good you feel like you are with ya ara and talia walking toward the ocean to the edge of the cliff the english subtitles follow the hebrew script very closely it is interesting to note that even though out of sight is not a direct translation of lemarit ayin both names are very appropriate to the story
since the title is in english and imdb lists this show s primary language as english i shall concentrate on reviewing the english version of gundam wing as presented in the bandai released dvd set my actual review for the whole series is under imdb s entry of shin kid senki gundam w very little is changed in respect to plot script and characterization its adaptation to english and it really depends on your own taste to choose which language to watch this show in purists can stick to japanese all they want but for a more realistic experience i recommend the english track since all the characters except heero yuy are not japanese most of them are caucasian in fact with a couple of non japanese asians for one thing the characters personalities come across more directly than in the japanese version the contrast between the characters is stronger thanks to some give or take performances but a very well cast group of actors wing gundam s pilot heero yuy is a highly trained soldier who suppresses his emotions but slowly learns the value of his humanity voiced by mark hildreth who s deadpan delivery can be criticized as bad acting but it matches heero s personality very well deathscythe gundam s duo maxwell ever cheerful in the face of death is given a crash course in the cherishing the value of life and friends he is possibly the best acted character in the whole show masterfully played by scott mcneil he may sound a little too old for his age but duo s english voice easily out ranks his irritatingly nasal japanese one trowa the pilot of heavyarms is a lost lonely soul who s only purpose so far has been combat despite his inner desire to form connections with the people around him he only knows how to kill not to befriend kirby morrow gives a somber but realistic performance as trowa barton quatre rebarba winner is voiced by brad swaile who has no trouble brining out the caring nature of the character and the shattering of his innocence as he experiences horrors of war and death first hand a huge plus point is that quatre no longer sounds like a girl and yes he is voiced by a female actress in the japanese version but a bona fide typical year old guy the impulsive but determined wufei chang voiced by ted cole may seem a little over the top but it plays out in stark contrast to the more subdued roles of heero and trowa relena darlian sounds older in english voiced by lisa ann bailey this might not sit well with her youthful personification early in the series but as her character matures later into the story her voice follows suit and ends up fitting in very well with the character development zechs merquise would be one of the more drastically changed voices when compared to the japanese version both voices bring out different sides to the same character his japanese voice is haughty authoritative and commands respect keeping in line with his high ranking status and charismatic nature his english voice by brian drummond is more subdued sounding more devious and snake like highlighting zechs secretive nature regarding his hidden agendas and staunch beliefs in his ideals the members of oz are a mixed bag really treize kushrenada voiced by david kaye is given a more realistic and down to earth performance compared to his larger than life japanese style of speaking however lady une does not convey her split personality as contrastingly as in the japanese version and lucrencia noin just sounds bored most of the time the cannon fodder pilots and military leaders are nothing to speak of either i would have appreciated if they took the time to give different characters different accents to reflect their ethnic backgrounds the maganac corp s voices were generally uninspired but could have been more interesting if they were given middle eastern accents the members of the romerfeller foundation would have also sounded better with some classy european accent that reflects their status of nobility despite underwhelming acting from the side characters the main cast manage to carry the show and it results in an overall less over the top and more realistic rendition of gundam wing s script very faithful to the original japanese script keeping all the underlying thought provoking ideas and themes about politics war and human nature sadly it also retains the flaws of the original japanese script
i first saw this movie on television some years ago and frankly loved it charles dance makes one of the most terrifying villains anyone can imagine his sophistication is such a perfect contrast to the crudely good hero i have never been much of an eddie murphy fan but find his irritating portrayal here a winner a bit of axel foley through the looking glass charlotte lewis is to utilize a hackneyed phrase but the only one applicable luminously gorgeous some scenes are wonderfully created the dream sequence the bird the silly fight scenes and the climactic confrontation through it all murphy is the modern man suddenly dropped into an oriental myth a stunned and quieter version of kurt russell in his oriental fantasy romp like that movie we have james hong the incomparable actor whose scenes however short raise the quality even of derek since hong has defined the fine supporting actor the class act of his profession the golden child is silly it is not perfect but it has so many redeeming features that it is an enjoyable and amusing fantasy well worth watching after four years i have seen the golden child again i enjoyed it even more it truly is great fun
the arrival of an world famous conductor sets of unexpected events and feelings in the small village some people are threatened by the way he handles the church choir and how people in it gradually change this movie is heartwarming and makes you leave the cinema with both a smile on your lips and tears in your eyes it a about bringing out the best in people and kay pollak has written an excellent script based on the ideas he has become so famous for the actors are outstanding michael nyqvist we know before but frida hallgren was an new and charming acquaintances to me she has a most vivid face that leaves no one untouched per moberg does his part as gabriella s husband almost too well he is awful too see one only wish the at he would be casted to play a nice guy one day so we can see if he masters that character as well this is a movie that will not leave you untouched if you haven t already seen it do it today
like many people on this site i saw this movie only once when it was first televised in certain scenes linger in my memory and an overall feeling of disquiet is how i remember being affected by it i would be fascinated to see it again if it was ever made available for home video possible spoiler i wonder if anyone else would agree that the basic plot setup and characters might have been derived from a british movie originally titled city of the dead retitled horror hotel for the american release there are some similarities also to a later british film the wicker man one detail remains with me years after seeing the film it s a small but significant moment near the beginning of the film as i recall a minister and his wife have stopped to aid some people by the side of the road circa somewhere out west the friendly seeming ray milland introduces himself and his daughter yvette mimieux a beautiful young mute woman while the preacher is helping ray milland with the wagon a rattlesnake slithers into view and coils menacingly unobserved by any of the characters except yvette mimieux she doesn t look scared at all but stares at the snake with silent concentration until it goes away with this strange little moment we already realize there s something highly unusual about these seemingly normal folks though the possible danger to the minister and his wife remains vague and uncertain for a long time that one little scene stays with me vividly after all these years along with many others the film has a haunting quality about it that won t let go and it s not surprising that people remember it so vividly someone ought to make this available for home video
if you like deep purple you will enjoy in this excellent movie with stephen rea in main role the story is about the most famous rock group back there in s strange fruits and they decided to play together again but of course there is going to be lots of problem during theirs concerts jimmy nail and bill nighy are great and song the flame still burns is perfect you have to watch it
based on the idea from gackt moon child took place in a poverty stricken country called mallepa in a futuristic timeline the story followed the lives of the two main characters kei hyde and sho gackt and their friends growing up together despite some actions might be overly done or perhaps humorous i strongly believed that this is a movie about friendship even amongst all the hardships between each character in the end each of them wanted to have someone on their side to have friends unlike most vampire characters kei portrayed a vampire that loathed the idea of having to kill in order to live a vampire found friendship in the hand of a young boy sho who s not afraid of kei regardless of what some might ve thought i see kei as a fatherly figure to sho kei was there throughout the earlier life of sho he took care of him and taught him to live in a world where power between gangs controls their lives on the other hand sho who perhaps can be seen as an innocent enthusiastic style young man he grew up to be a man who realised that life isn t all about fun and games that death exists and able to take away his loved ones i love the part where lee hom the actor who played son first appeared on the screen the way they met up was quite cool indeed son also has a big part within this movie the fact that he s from a different race a taiwanese made quite an impact to the friendship theme within the movie the way how friendships were developed despite background differences was portrayed excellently in this movie i believed that each actor did a great job considering that this was their first time to appear in such big screen movie both hyde and gackt managed to act quite well and created quite believable characters unlike movies that had musician turned actors and filled the movie with songs they ve done great acting jobs moon child really made an impact for me it has given friendships a new meaning and consideration that we have to appreciate every friendship in our lifetimes the movie shows a lot of hope despite all the bad things that happen in their lives that there s always hope life can be cruel that it seems hope doesn t exist anymore it also shows a very strong sense of friendships between each other even when son became the enemy sho did have some sort of fun at their last battle every single one of them desired peace in the end no matter how far apart they ve become the ending scene showed it to us
charming doesn t even begin to describe saving grace it s absolutely irresistible anyone who ventures into this movie will leave with their spirits soaring high haha grace trevethyn brenda blethyn has just lost her husband but her problems are about to get a whole lot worse her dearly departed has left her with no money and outstanding debts faced with losing everything she has to find out a way to get a lot of cash fast she gets an idea when her gardener matthew craig ferguson asks the town famous horticulturist to give him advice on a plant he is secretly growing grace immediately realizes that his plant is marijuana so they decide to use her gardening skills to grow a lot of top quality weed and then sell it to pay off her outstanding debts the most notable quality about saving grace is its likability every character is extremely sympathetic and save for the first or so minutes the film is non stop good cheer everyone wants a happy ending for everyone even if it means turning a blind eye to some rather illegal activities the acting is top notch brenda blethyn is one of britain s finest actresses and here is why she turns what could have been a caricature into a fully living and breathing individual she s a nice lady but she s not stupid craig ferguson is equally amiable as matthew he s a deadbeat loser but he s so likable that it doesn t matter the rest of the ensemble cast fits in this category as well but special mention has to go to tcheky karyo the french actor always has a aura of menace about him and that suits him well but he also has great comedy skills nigel cole finds the perfect tone for saving grace it s all about the charm one of the problems i have with british humor is that all the energy seems to be drained out of the film not so here the film is thoroughly likable and always amusing that s not to say that saving grace is just a likable movie that will leave you with a grin and a good feeling while this movie is not an out and out comedy it does boast two or three scenes that are nothing short of hysterical if there s any problem with the film it s that the climax is a little confusing the questions are answered though and the ending boasts an unexpected twist see saving grace especially when you re having a bad day
if it s action and adventure you want in a movie then you d be best advised to look elsewhere on the other hand if it s a lazy day and you want a good movie to go along with that mood check out the straight story richard farnsworth puts on a compelling performance as the gentle and gentlemanly alvin straight in this true story of alvin s journey on a riding mower across three states to see his estranged brother who has had a stroke farnsworth is perfect in this role as he travels his long and winding road making friends of strangers and doling out lots of grandfatherly type advice about family along the way the story moves along as slowly as the riding mower but somehow manages to keep the viewer watching waiting for the next life lesson alvin s going to offer stretch out on the couch relax and enjoy it s the only way to watch this very good movie which rates a in my book
this film moved me beyond comprehension it is and will remain my favourite film of all time mainly because it has almost every emotion all rolled into its minutes what is the hardest part for me to take is that whenever i want to hear the amazing music and songs from the film i have to put it into my dvd player so i was wondering if anyone anywhere knows who sings the songs in the film and where they can be found as i have looked everywhere i can think sporadically over the past years my favourite quote from the film is when in court the advocate says but your own words ask for direct confrontation isn t that a direct call for violence biko replies well you and i are in confrontation now but i see no violence craig robertson fife scotland
the plot intellect is about as light as feather down but the advantage here is the boy and girl classic refusal we have become accustomed to in the gay divorcee and top hat is now absent instead of the typical accidental acquaintance the dancing duo are the former lovers bake baker and sherry martin who are still in love since their dancing days of course being a s musical there s the problems of misunderstood romance classy courtship and the slight irritation of a sabotaged audition with bicarbonate soda has costing ginger something rather special and then in the grand tradition of dwindling finances there s nothing better for hollywood s best entertainers than put on a show delightful numbers from irving berlin are sprinkled throughout the show top hats and evening dresses are saved right until the end which remains a refreshing change fred and ginger are out again to charm the world and charm the navy everyone and everything is once again just so enjoyable pure classic silliness at its best but with astaire and rogers we just know it s got to work rating
on one level this film can bring out the child in us that just wants to build sandcastles and throw stuff in the air just for the sake of seeing it fall down again on a deeper level though it explores a profound desire to reconnect with the land i thoroughly empathized with the artist when he said when i m not out here alone for any length of time i feel unrooted i considered andy goldsworthy one of the great contemporary artists i m familiar with his works mainly through his coffee table books and a couple art gallery installations but to see his work in motion captured perfectly through riedelsheimer s lens was a revelation unfrozen in time goldsworthy s creations come alive swirling flying dissolving crumbling crashing and that s precisely what he s all about time the process of creation and destruction of emergence and disappearing of coming out of the void and becoming the universe and back again there s a shamanic quality about him verging on madness you get the feeling watching him at work that his art is a lifeforce for him that if he didn t do it he would whither and perish luckily for us goldsworthy is able to share his vision through the communication medium of photography otherwise with the exception of a few cairns and walls they would only exist for one person
after aakrosh this was the second film for govind nihalani as a director till this movie was made there was no audience for documentaries in india this movie proved a point that a documentary can fulfil the requirements of a commercial film without diluting its essence it was one of the successful movies in the year in which it was released this movie contested against the big banners of the bollywood like coolie betaab hero in smithapatel in this movie acted more like a conscience of the hero whenever he drifted away or lost his composure she was there to remind him she was not like an usual heroine to do the usual stuff of running around the trees and shrubs at one time she even gave up her love when the hero s ruthlessness touched the roof top there was another character in this movie which was played by om puri contemporary naseeruddin shah he played as an inspector turned alcoholic character the role conveyed the message of the end result of a honest cop who rubbed the wrong side of the system which also gave the viewers a chance to forecast the hero s ending in his debut film sadashiv amrapurkar captivated the audience with his cameo role which ultimately won him the best supporting actor by the filmfare the cop in the movie was not a complete straight forward personality he was able to adjust to the system to an extent the anger which left half handedly continued in govind nihalani s other film drohkaal even after two decades this movie is remembered just because of the director and the entire crew each one played their part par excellence
i don t know why i picked this movie to watch it has a strange title and from the description it just looked like something different every once in a while its good to try a film that s slightly different from the mainstream hollywood hero thriller flick and this film certainly was different right from the beginning this film had me intrigued but i couldn t figure out why until the end if the film when i realized that the movie was great because the characters were so real i thought the acting was superb and the character development really makes you care about them and hope things turn out well for them in the end i think that everyone who watches the film could in some way relate to one of the characters and this makes for great viewing and some good laughs at the sheer ordinariness of the actors at the culmination of the movie you definitely get a sense of well being and are left with the things are going to be ok type of a feeling i m sure this will have wide appeal and should be given a chance
stuck in a hotel in kuwait i happily switched to the channel showing this at the very beginning first pachelbel s canon brought a lump to my throat then the sight of a tiger moth which my grandfather my father and i have all flown produced a slight dampness around the eyes and then crowe s name hooked me completely i was entranced by this film crowe s performance again the subject matter and yes what a debt we owe how various matters were addressed and dealt with the flying sequences my father flew avro ansons too the story and as another contributor pointed out crowe s recitation of high flight i won t spoil the film for anyone but separated from my wife by odd miles as an ex army officer who was deployed in a couple of wars and as private pilot i admit to crying heartily a couple of times buy it rent it download it beg borrow or steal it but watch it ps did i spy a bristol blenheim in yellow training colours on the ground looked like a twin engine aircraft with a twin brownings in a dorsal turret

it starts slowly showing the dreary lives of the two housewives who decide to rent a castle in italy for the month of april but don t give up on it nothing much happens but the time passes exquisitely and there are numerous sly jokes my favorite is the carriage ride in the storm which i find hilarious the movie is wonderfully romantic in many senses of the word the scenery is beautiful as is polly walker and the resolutions in the movie are very satisfying the movie takes a couple of liberties with the book the biggest being with the arbuthnot briggs dester business but i actually preferred the movie s version of this it may be more sentimental but i felt that it was more consistent with the tone of the story and anyway i like sentiment when it s well done an excellent movie especially as a date movie during lousy weather
very possibly one of the funniest movies in the world oscar material trey parker and matt stone are hilarious and before you see this i suggest you see south park one of the funniest cartoons created buy it you will laugh every time you see it pure stroke of genius if you don t think its funny then you have no soul or sense of humor out of
tears of kali is an original yet flawed horror film that delves into the doings of a cult group in india comprised of german psychologists who have learned how to control their wills and their bodies to the point that they can cause others to be healed through radical techniques that can trigger nightmarish hallucinations and physical pain and torture to release the pent up demons inside them the film is shown as a series of vignettes about the taylor eriksson group the above mentioned cult group the first segment is somewhat slower than the rest but serves fine to set up the premise for the rest of the film the rest of it plays out like a mindf ck film with some of the key staples thrown in the mix full frontal nudity some gore to keep you happy i say check this out may not be spectacular but it s concept is pretty neato and it delivers in the right spots
barbara stanwyck gives this early douglas sirk directed universal produced soap just the kick that it needs not nearly as memorable as sirk s later melodramas it s easy to see by watching all i desire where sirk would be heading artistically in the next few years stanwyck is a showgirl who returns to her family in smalltown u s a after deserting them a decade earlier her family and community have mixed emotions in dealing with her shocking return some of the cinematography is amazing and stanwyck is tough as nails and really gives this film a shot of energy overall a fairly good show
i saw the grudge yesterday and wow i was really scared a good thing i love horror movies and i really liked this one there were so many surprise scenes what s the english word that made you jump in your seat though too much screaming from the audience made it difficult not to laugh i think the most scary scene was on the bus when the face flashes by on the window or when yoko s walking without her chin the make up is also very good sometimes you could really see it was there but it was still adding a freaky look to the scene the boy was very good indeed so cute without make up and so terribly scary with it on the next time i hear a cracking noise i will probably feel pretty scared
according to john ford s lyrically shot fictional biopic of abraham lincoln s life his greatest faults may have been an obtuseness with woman and an ability to dance in the worst way ford s camera has only praising views to reveal of mr lincoln s early life but for what the film lacks in character complexities it makes up for in beauty and depth of vision uncharacteristically beautiful compositions of early film what could have been a series of gorgeous still frames ford has a unique eye for telling a story the film sings of the life of a hopeful young man henry fonda plays the contemplative and spontaneously clever lincoln to a tee one of his best roles the film concerns two young men brothers on trial for a murder that both claim to have committed in classic angry mob style the town decides to take justice into their own hands and lynch the pair of them until honest abe steps into the fray he charms them with his humor telling them not to rob him of his first big case and that they are as good as lynched with him as the boys lawyer what follows seems to become the outline for all courtroom murder dramas thereafter as abe cunningly interrogates witnesses to the delight and humor of the judge jury and town before he stumbles upon the missing links the film plays out like many john ford movies do a tablespoon of americana a dash of moderate predictability a hint of sarcasm that you aren t sure if you put in the recipe or if ford did it himself despite the overtly hollywood feel of the film and overly patriotic banter alluding to lincoln s future presidency the film is entirely enjoyable and enjoyably well constructed if you can take your drama with a grain of salt
this early sirk melodrama shot in black and white is a minor film yet showcases the flair of the german director in enhancing tired story lines into something resembling art set in the s barbara stanwyck is the woman who has sinned by abandoning her small town husband and family for the lure of the chicago stage she never fulfilled her ambitions and is drawn back to the town she left by an eager letter from her daughter informing her that she too has taken a liking to the theatre a high school production that is back in her old town she once again comes up against small mindedness and has to deal with her hostile eldest daughter bewildered and boring husband richard carlson and ex lover the plot is nothing new but sirk sets himself apart by creating meaningful compositions with every frame carefully shot and he is aided immeasurably by having stanwyck as his leading lady it runs a crisp minutes and that s just as well because the material doesn t really have the legs to go any further
this movie is very funny amitabh bachan and govinda are absolutely hilarious acting is good comedy is great they are up to their usual thing it would be good to see a sequel to this watch it good time pass movie
this and hidden fortress are the kurosawa s that are most dear to me i don t hand out s like candy but this certainly deserved it if anything even though it s quite long like all kurosawa s pretty much are it concurred the problem which bugs me with most of his films the storyline is often too loose and slowly evolving containing scenes that are unnecessary or just lenghtened too much without any real purpose to the storyline or the character description dodesukaden delivered to me the same experience that for example hidden fortress did despite its lenght there wasn t a single minute i would cut out this is also a very unusual kurosawa film in a way it has no storyline but many little independent stories which are based more to the character description than storyline unlike any other kurosawa film i have seen so far it also leans much on the dialogue which he uses brilliantly especially in the story between the father and the son planning their new house still the thing that makes this one a masterpiece is how the subject being so tragic as it is is managed to be described so humanely and sympathetically without pointing fingers at anybody at any point from the beginning to the end it delivers the whole emotional scale from laughter to tears in perfect balance
orson welles the lady from shanghai does not have the brilliant screenplay of citizen kane e g but charles lawton jr s cinematography the unforgettable set pieces such as the scene in the aquarium the seagoing scene featuring a stunning blonde tressed rita hayworth singing please don t love me and the truly amazing hall of mirrors climax and the wonderful cast everett sloane in his greatest performance welles in a beautifully under played role the afore mentioned miss hayworth welles wife at the time at her most gorgeous make for a very memorable filmgoing experience the bizarre murder mystery plot is fun and compelling not inscrutable at all the viewer is surprised by the twists and turns and welles closing line is an unheralded classic the lady from shanghai gets four stars from this impartial arbiter
it s a tale that could have taken place anywhere really given the right circumstances street entertainer catching the attention of famous opera star and friendship ensuing the aging entertainer finds buys a male child to pass his art to from there we follow them through the rigors of their challenging but free life along the river traveling town to town he performs and has some degree of notoriety despite the times and the influences the man is kind and good overall the performances are first rate especially xu zhu who portrays the street performer the child renying zhou is beautiful and downright strong and withstands the overt prejudices well the two protagonists along with supporting help from the kind opera singer master liang an interestingly androgynous zhao zhigang paint a very interesting tale of forgiveness sadness and love some have mentioned this film s remote similarities to ba wang bie ji farewell my concubine yet this film can t stand easily on its own any resemblance is remote at best my only qualm with the king of masks is the ending it was weak cliche and about as subtle as a sledgehammer the audience was already wrapped up in the story what was the needless manipulation for what a shame to bring a fine motion picture that far only to surrender to emotional and corny pathos like that it frankly made this film good instead of the classic it should ve been that aside the king of masks is still very well worth your time i was happy to see the shaw brothers are still producing good films highly recommended
this is one of the best jodie foster movies out there and largely ignored due to the general public s misconception of it as a teen flick it has wonderful performances particularly a fight scene between jodie and her mother played by a convincing sally kellerman the three girls that play jodie s friends are somewhat amateurish but i do think it is worth seeing
what is contained on this disk is a first rate show by a first rate band this disc is not for the faint of heart the music is incredibly intense and very cool what you will learn when you watch this movie is just why the who was so huge for so long it is true that their records were great but their shows were the top of the heap in when this concert was shot the screaming teenie boppers that threw jelly beans at the beatles were gone and bands and audiences had settled down to long and often amazing displays of musical virtuosity something that few audiences have the intellectual curiosity to pursue in the age of canned music by britney and christina what you especially learn here are the amazing things that can happen when gifted musicians are encouraged to improvise try the concert out it really is amazing
this film is to my mind the weakest film in the original star wars trilogy for a variety of reasons however it emerges at the end of the day a winner despite all its flaws it s still a very good film even if a lot of its quality depends on the characters that have been built up in the superior installments one problem here is the look of the film which isn t very consistent with the other films i put a lot of that down to the departure of producer gary kurtz the first films have that dirty lived in look with all the technology and so forth in jedi on the other hand even the rebels look like they just stepped out of a shower and had their uniforms dry cleaned this makes for a much less textured film also the creatures were excessively muppet like and cutesy at this point it seems like the film makers were more concerned with creating the templates for future action figures than with the quality of the film itself another aspect is its lack of originality where star wars created a whole new experience in cinema and empire brought us to alien worlds of swamps ice and clouds jedi lamely re cycled the locations of the first film first we are back on the desert planet tatooine and then we are watching them face another death star maybe the emperor couldn t think of anything new but you d think lucas or kasdan could also we have these ewoks who really are just detestable made for mattel teddy bears in a recycled version of what was supposed to be the big wookie fight at the end of star wars if they hadn t run out of cash it just feels like lazy construction the most unfortunate aspect of jedi for me is the weak handling of the han solo character whereas he is central to the plot of the first films here he is struggling for screen time trading one liners with the droids instead of a real drama we re stuck with the lame pretense that han is still convinced leia loves luke as if the conclusion of empire where she confessed her love of him had never happened the whole thing is very contrived and barely conceals the fact that the solo character was not part of this film s central story after his rescue ford for his part looks bored and lacks the style that distinguished his earlier performances this is more like a s ford performance bored and looking above the film itself fisher for her part is visibly high in some scenes lando an interesting character introduced in empire here is stuck as the ostensible person we care about in the giant space battle only hamill given an interesting development in the luke character is really able to do anything new or interesting with his character probably he was the only major actor in the film who still cared about his work and to be fair the script gives him a lot more to do than the other characters really it is his story and the other characters are only there as part of the package ian mcdiarmid does excellent work as well as the emperor the film would sink if he had been too far over the top as he was at times in the new films visually and in terms of effects work other than the clean look of everything it s hard to find fault jabba is a very effective animatronic character one of the most elaborate ever constructed the space battles towards the end are very impressive ultimately this film coasts to success based on the accomplishments of its forebears but on its own it is a satisfying piece of entertainment and imho far superior to any of lucas later productions
i think the movie was pretty good will add it to my clasic collection after all this time i believe i saw other posters who reminded some of the pickier people that it is still just a movie maybe some of the more esoteric points defy logic but a great many religious matters accepted on faith fail to pass the smell test if you re going to accept whatever faith you subscribe to you can certainly accept a movie is it just me or has anyone else noticed the aja yee dagger is the same possessed knife lamonte cranston had so much trouble gaining control of in the shadow no mention of it in the trivia section for either movie here imdb but i would bet a dollar to a donut it s the same prop
this movie should be required viewing for all librarians or would be librarians all of the best lines are directly related to librarianship the public library vs academic library argument is a classic argument waged among librarians and library school students it also breaks many librarian stereotypes librarians might even be capable of having fun even if they don t usually have sex in the romance languages section the best movie about librarians desk set with katherine hepburn and spencer tracy of course
i have read with great interest the only available comment made before mine on this movie and i would first like to say that i understand the point of view of the previous user who commented on this movie very well viewed from an israeli perspective i can very well imagine that this movie touches upon very sensitive issues and that the slightest detail can have a great importance for a viewer who is more or less directly concerned by the events depicted in this movie what i would like to say is that distortion was shown at a film festival in geneva in november festival cin ma tout cran where it won the award of the audience prix du public in french for what affects me i liked the nervous camera work of mr bouzaglo who in my opinion portrayed an atmosphere of extreme tension and uneasiness in the movie very well and i think that most of the swiss viewers appreciated this in the movie this perspective however might seem totally alien to an israeli viewer but not so surprising when it comes to swiss viewers because switzerland is a country which has never been subject to any terrorist attack it therefore comes as no surprise that the audience in geneva judged this film with a much more detached perspective i would also like to quote what mr bouzaglo said when he was interviewed by a geneva newspaper i m translating from french after years of living here and after undergoing all this violence we may ask ourselves if it is still possible to remain normal we might sometimes think that it would be easier to commit suicide than to go on living we are like the characters in my movie on the edge of the edge this is the reason why the private detective who is somehow voyeur is the happiest character in the movie because he earns a living thanks to the system he takes advantage of this situation this is in substance the main thing that i and the swiss public in my opinion pointed out in this movie and that we did not pay attention to some inconsistencies regarding the characters in the movie which the precedent reviewer pointed out with great accuracy and humor so to sum up different country different perspective but i think that this is somehow great because it reassures me for what affects the future of cinema that is to say that it well never be subject to a unique of formatted way of thinking
amazing documentary saw it on original airdate and on dvd a few times in the last few years i was shocked that it wasn t even nominated for a best documentary oscar for the year it was released no other documentary even comes close it was on tv recently for the th anniversary but i missed the added where are they now segment at the end except i did catch that tony now works for the hazmat unit i ve seen criticism on documentary film making from a few on this list i can t see how this could have been done any different they had less than months to assemble this and get it on the air the dvd contains more material and background i m also surprised that according to imdb com the brother have had no projects in the four years since what have they been doing
the road rovers was a great show about canine superheroes chosen by the master to fight crime around the world the show was hilarious to say the least simple and complex jokes that could appeal to all ages running jokes throughout the series that could spawn a drinking game the action was mesmerizing and cleverly set up the characters were very original each with a very different personality but what made me enjoy the show the most was the depth of the characters each of them have struggles and emotional difficulties that are never expressed but implied in subtext hopefully one day there ll be some way to watch the rovers in action again
not only is this movie a great film for basic cinematography screenplay acting setting etc but also for it s realism this movie could take place in any farm or rural setting it makes no difference if the movie takes place in louisiana or if it would take place in kansas the story and the messages it includes would remain the same this movie shows family values and connections for an older audience while at the same time it shows youthful behavior for the younger viewers everyone who watches this will walk away with something having touched them personally i know i did the ending hits way too close to home for me not to burst into tears every time i watch it the ending stresses the importance of farm safety and everyone who has ever worked on a farm needs to see this film not paying attention and carelessness gets you into dangerous situations
this is a wonderful film makes the s look beautifully stylish kim novak is intriguing and compelling as a modern day witch with one foot in manhattan and another in infinity all the supporting performances are terrific from jack lemmon as her bother nicky to ernie kovacs as the author of magic in mexico who is working on magic in manghattan to elsa lanchester as the slightly batty as well as witchy aunt queenie and then there is the cat i have no idea how many witches besides me have named a cat pyewacket but suggest a zillion jmes stewart looks out of place but only just as much as his character is out of p ace in this weird sub world of magic and witchcraft perfect and it has the perfect romantic happy ending which we believe in because movies of this vintage do have those happy endings gillian and shep certainly have as much chance to be happy ever after as rose and charlie allnut in the african queen another great film
the ogre is a film made for tv in italy and wasn t intended to be a sequel to demons as lamberto bava even mentions it on the interview on the sheirk show dvd but it was called demons iii to be part of the demons series the music in demons and demons was s rock music while this is more creepy music and while the first two was gory horror demons iii the ogre is a architectural horror so that s how demons iii isn t a proper sequel to demons but i still like this film the music is creepy and that adds a tone to the castle that the film is set in the ogre is another thing why i like the film there are two other films that are classed as demons iii and that is black demons demoni and the church demons demons iii the ogre is a good film as long as you don t compare it with demons and demons
disney have done it again brilliant the way timone and pumbaa are brought back to life yet again to tell us how they came to meet and help simba when he needed them i love this film and watch it over and over again it shows how timone lived with his family and fellow meerkats before setting off to find his dream home and adventure then he meets pumbaa and things do change together they search for the home timon wants and repeatedly fail which is funny as timone gets more and more crazy then simba turns up and we see more of his childhood than we did in the previous films the rest you already know
the synopsis for this movie does a great job at explaining what to expect it s a very good thriller well shot tough to believe it was bill paxton s directorial debut though some shots do look exactly like a storyboard version still there are a few shots that really look good and show some real imagination on the part of paxton it s a solid story with some great twists at the end several of them all believable all fun and best of all obscured well enough to make them true twists the child actors in the movie do a great too i m usually wary of movies with kids in starring roles because all too often they come off as nickelodeon rejects but both these kids do a good job this movie is not gory it s not very scary but it is very very creepy
lots of reviews on this page mention that this movie is a little dark for kids that depends on the kid this isn t a movie for a year old it s more geared toward the years and older crowd i saw this movie when i was i absolutely loved it at the time most animated movies were a little too childish for my tastes this movie deals with more serious issues and therefore has a little more emotional impact in this movie characters can die and be sent to hell this gives a little more emotional weight to the scenes where characters are risking their lives the good guys aren t always perfectly sweet and nice like other cartoons they have real motivations like revenge and greed but also compassion and friendship shows that things aren t always black and white excellent movie
this drama is unlike sex and the city where the women have a few drinks and share their sexual encounters with each other its much more personal and people can relate to it its much more engaging and emotional on a new level than other dramas focusing on women and their lives like sex and the city lipstick jungle dr katie roden is a psychologist with a dark secret she seems much more depressed and guilt ridden than the rest of her friends she is dealing with the death of her former lover who was her patient while tackling his son s advances on her her sombre clothes and empty and cold house convey her inside emotions very well trudi malloy a widow is battling issues with letting go of her dead husband from and when a handsome stranger richard shows an interest in her she is suddenly forced to do a reality check by her friends who suggest that she gets back into dating business the ridiculous and embarrassing courting scenes between richard and trudi are totally funny it is interesting to note that richard asks her out the day she gets a millions from the board for her husband s death lets see what his intentions are siobhan dillon a lawyer is fed up of her husband s love making tactics which only involve baby making as they are having trouble conceiving and she quickly falls for her colleague who offer his services a little too willingly to her and she does not hesitate for long it will interesting to see whether she will continue her affair or patch up with her husband played by raza jeffrey jessica a real estate business woman is single and is straight until she organizes a lesbian wedding and has an affair with one of them her character is shown as a bold and provocative woman who before her lesbian encounter is having sex with a married man her colleague lets see where her character venture to the beauty of this drama is that we are shown totally different women with different scenarios whose ambitions and inhibitions are shown its also a good thing that the drama reveals the fact that sometimes friends lie to each other to be safe
i caught this movie about years ago and have never had it of my mind surely someone out there will release it on video or hey why not dvd the ford coupe is the star if you have any head for cars watch this and be blown away
as the story in my family goes my dad milton raskin played the piano for the dorsey band after sinatra joined the band my dad practiced with him for hours on end then at a point in time my dad told sinatra that he was actually to good to be tied up with such a small group band and that he should venture off on his own by that time sinatra had enough credits under his belt to do just that dorsey never forgave my dad and the rest as they say is history i have some pictures and records to that effect and so does berkley university in california i have seen just about every sinatra movie more times than i wish to say and his movies never get old thank you frank
the bourne ultimatum is the third and final outing for super spy jason bourne a man who is out to kill the people who made him into a killer the bourne series is one of the highest regarded trilogies by critics ultimatum has an on metacritic com meaning it s status is universal acclaim and for good reason the fighting is choreographed very well and the deep story can be very engrossing first i highly advise you watch the bourne identity and the bourne supremacy the two fancy titled prequels to ultimatum there may be three different movies but in reality they are all a continuance of one another missing one leaves you stranded and confused just like i was you will still be about to enjoy the action and fight scenes of ultimatum if you missed the first two but then the story will definitely lead to some confusion if you were lucky enough to view the prequels to this movie you probably had a treat watching bourne take down his enemies and track down the man who screwed him from supremacy jason bourne is played very well by matt damon damon does nothing to deserve an oscar nod but his work here is good enough to hold it s own bourne s adventures take place in many different cities the cities are all varied enough to keep the movie from becoming bland at times the agency tracking bourne takes advantage of every technological tool known to mankind to track him down i won t go into detail on the characters because they are continuations off of the first two movies however it wouldn t hurt the movie to spell a few things out for the audience not every viewer is a die hard movie watcher who can pick up on every little hint about story development ultimatum wouldn t have been harmed at all if the story was a little more up front it seems most people agree that ultimatum was a success of a film the movie opened to million and box office total now is up to mil is currently still going very strongly for a movie that has been in theatres since august it s the best action movie i ve seen since live free or die hard good damon is solid but not spectacular very smart movie bad story is like many others
yes i call this a perfect movie not one boring second a fantastic cast of mostly little known actresses and actors a great array of characters who are all well defined and who all have understandable motives i could sympathize with perfect lighting crisp black and white photography a fitting soundtrack an intelligent and harmonious set design and a story that is engaging and works it s one of those prime quality pictures on which all the pride of hollywood should rest the mark everyone should endeavor to reach barbara stanwyck is simply stunning there was nothing this actress couldn t do and she always went easy on the melodramatic side no hysterical outbursts with this lady i always thought she was a better actress than screen goddesses like bette davis or joan crawford and this movie confirmed my opinion always as tough as nails and at the same time conveying true sentiments it is fair to add that she also got many good parts during her long career and this one is by far the least interesting the title fits this movie very well it is about desires human desires i think everyone can understand actually no one seems to be scheming in this movie all characters act on impulse everybody wants to be happy without hurting anybody else the sad fact that this more often than not leads to complications makes for the dramatic content into which i will not go here i liked what this movie has to say about youth about maturing and about the necessity to compromise the movie i associate most with this one is alfred hitchcock s shadow of a doubt it creates a similar atmosphere of idealized and at the same time caricatured small town america the story has a certain similarity with fritz lang s considerably harsher movie clash by night made one year earlier where stanywck stars in a similar part i can also recommend it
this is not the stuff of soap operas but the sort of conundrums that real people face in real life a testament to the ensemble and director for the powerful story telling of fallible characters trying to cope but not quite succeeding
casomai is a masterful tale depicting the story of a young couple who wade through the murky waters of marriage the story is very believable in telling the strange see saw between oblivion and continuous interference by others which is fairly typical in italy one may wonder whether such happenings are different elsewhere though pavignano and d alatri were very good at writing and that is one of the strong points of the movie acting by stefania rocca and fabio volo is sober and gripping and the figure of the sympathetic priest is funny and well rounded all in all a truly deserving movie probably one of the best italian movies of the year
a featherweight plot and dubious characterizations don t make any difference when a movie is as fun to watch as this one is lively action and spectacular stunts for their day give this movie some real zip and there s some actual comedy from the ripping chemistry between the two leads quinn makes a good villain also although his role is completely overshadowed but don t be fooled by maureen o hara s tough broad role this is as sexist as any hollywood movie of this era you might be able to forgive that because of the time in which it was made but it s still hard to get past for all the heroism and gruesomely adult off screen situations this is still little more than an adolescent good time
absolutely enjoyable singing and dancing movie starring frank sinatra and gen kelly as well as kathryn grayson the film won and oscar for george e stoll s score and it garnered nominations for best picture best actor for kelly and best cinematography as well as a best son nomination for i fall in love too easily sung by sinatra it was a cute story about kelly helping his pal sinatra get a girl and falling in love with her himself the lovely grayson the toast of new orleans dazzled us with her singing and we had a lot of great songs and dance routines by kelly and sinatra as well as the artistry of pianist conductor jos iturbi a classic hollywood music from an era gone by
nothing outta stars another weird premise from the director of the movie cube this time around there are two main characters who find themselves and their home transported to a mysterious white void there is literally nothing outside of their small two story house intriguing to be sure but i thought the comedic tone established for this movie from the get go was extremely ill conceived there needs to be some humour certainly and i have no problem with the humour that was eventually derived from the plight of our two heroes their final showdown was definitely a hoot but i really think the movie would have been a lot better off if it had stayed more rooted in reality in the beginning after watching the movie i watched the making of feature on the dvd and a short trailer at the end is almost totally devoid of the sillier comedic aspects making it look like a completely different and slightly better movie the last half hour of the movie is where things really start to come together similar in a way to the recent movie primer the actors are fine when they are not overdoing the comedy shtick they are really quite believable in their more normal moments i was probably ready to write this movie off as a failed experiment at the midway point but it won me over by the end and keep watching past the credits for the final scene just don t ask me to explain it
dressed to kill has been more or less forgotten in critical circles in the past years but it is a true american classic a film which is much more than just a glossy thriller i sincerely hope the dvd release will give more people the chance to hear about it and see it
the matador is better upon reflection because at the time one is watching it it seems so light the humor is always medium gauge never unfunny but never gut busting the story is a very simple thread the characteristics of the plot are often recycled features namely the unscrupulous bad guy in need of a pal and the straight laced glass wearing good guy in need of security in life team up and learn from each other and somehow complement each other s lifestyles i also find the bullfighting parallel to the story unnecessary as it is a simply cruel thing and the symbolism is hardly potent enough to carry itself however it really is a good film because though it seemed so thin and unaffecting at the time it wasn t it has a subtle way of connecting with the audience i believe the reason it slowly but surely gives the audience something to take with them is because though it s a formula that is nothing new even most of the humor both main characters virtually the only characters in it are somehow met and gotten to know forget calling them real that s not at all what i mean what i mean is that though pierce brosnan s filthy womanizing boozing hit man is a detached comical character he s grasped firmly by the writer and definitely by brosnan who is aggressively communicating how much he enjoys his breath of fresh james bondless air greg kinnear s character seems quite the same in his detached scriptedness but he s given certain very unexpected footnotes that for a moment due to the film s lightfootedness pass us by but then hit us only a moment later we then realize the film is not simply analyze this or planes trains and automobiles told stalely over again its truly saying something the film s climax is of a sort that wants to partially be a thriller with twists but with its lightness how can that possibly be the focus of the film though the plot has been leading up to it no the focus is what brosnan and kinnear get out of their unlikely relationship to each other strangely the matador is a film about regret and loneliness brosnan deals with loneliness and regret every day and though we don t understand why kinnear is so lenient and accepting with brosnan continually interrupting his life it s slowly understood that brosnan is salvaging kinnear from a more down to earth version of his own feelings as a means of redemption the very last scene of the movie stays with me it i think is where the film s subtle side stepping impact finally begins to seep
that the bette davis version of this film was better than the kim novak version despite all of the other comments written here i really prefer the bette davis version even though the novak version has a more coherent story line however davis mildred s raw emotions seem to me to be more apt to a sluttish girl who seems easily to become a prostitute and it is those raw emotions that constitute part of what the poor doctor falls in love with he has emotions of despair of failure of otherness strong emotions that he represses davis mildred on the other hand displays her emotions immediately and without censure she has no feelings of despair or of failure or of otherness rather she is merely surviving as a poor cockney woman in the victorian era novak s portrayal was a more vulnerable mildred than was davis almost through the the whole movie davis mildred was never vulnerable until she actually had to go to the doctor and beg for assistance and when he reviles her for her method of keeping body and soul together and for continually taking advantage of his love for her she unleashes arguably the most passionate repudiation of snobbish holier than thou attitude ever seen on screen i wiped my mouth i wiped my mouth novak s vulnerability was excellent davis realism was monumental imdb votes concur
i watched this movie every chance i got back in the seventies when it came out on cable it was my introduction to harlem which has fascinated me and bill clinton ever since i was still very young and the movie made a big impression on me it was great to see a movie about other young girls growing up trying to decide whom they wanted to be and making some bad choices as well as good ones i was dazzled by lonette mckee s beauty the great dresses they eventually got to wear and the snappy dialogue as someone being raised by a single mother as well i could really identify with these girls and their lives it s funny these characters seem almost more real to me than beyonce knowles
for years i thought this knockabout service comedy was a product of john ford especially with victor mclaglen as one of the leads it certainly has the same rough house humor that ford laces his films with to my surprise i learned it was george stevens who actually directed it still i refuse to believe that this film wasn t offered to john ford but he was probably off in monument valley making stagecoach victor mclaglen along with cary grant and douglas fairbanks jr play three sergeants in the indian army who have a nice buddy buddy buddy camaraderie going but the old gang is breaking up because fairbanks is engaged to marry joan fontaine not if his two pals can help it aided and abetted by regimental beastie gunga din as played by sam jaffe the rudyard kipling poem served as the inspiration for this rko film about barracks life in the british raj the comic playing of the leads is so good that it does overshadow the incredibly racist message of the film not that the makers were racist but this was the assumption of the british there at the time including our leads and gunga din shows this most effectively the british took india by increments making deals here and there with local rulers under a weak mogul emperor who was done away with in the middle of the th century they ruled very little of india outright that would have been impossible their rule depended on the native troops you see here note that the soldiers cannot rise above the rank of corporal and gunga din is considerably lower in status than that note here that the rebels in fact are hindu not moslem there are as many strains of that religion as there are christian sects and this strangling cult was quite real of course to those being strangled they might not have the same view of them as liberators but until india organized its independence movement until the congress party came into being these people were the voice of a free india but however you slice it strangling people isn t a nice thing to do and the british had their point here also when i watch gunga din i think of star trek and the reason the prime directive came into being cary grant got to play his real cockney self here instead of the urbane cary we re used to seeing fairbanks and mclaglen do very well with roles completely suited to their personalities best acting role in the film however is eduard ciannelli as the guru the head of the strangler cult note the fire and passion in his performance he blows everyone else off the screen when he s on favorite scene in gunga din is ciannelli exhorting his troops in their mountain temple note how stevens progressively darkens the background around ciannelli until all you see are eyes and teeth like a ghoulish halloween mask haunting frightening and very effective it was right after the action of this film in the late nineteenth century that more and more of the british public started to question the underlying assumptions justifying the raj but that s the subject of gandhi gunga din is still a great film entertaining and funny it should be shown with a passage to india and gandhi and you can chart how the indian independence movement evolved
joseph h lewis was one of the finest directors of film noir this is surely his best it doesn t have some of the standard features of what we now call film noir though american made it is set entirely in england it lacks gangsters it lacks a femme fatale it does not lack crime the title character answers an ad she is overjoyed that she ll be making some money as a secretary instead she wakes up days later as the pawn in a frightening plot only a very strong person could survive such a terrifyingly unsettling ordeal and nina foch gives the sense of a strong woman as julia part of the excitement comes from casting against type ms foch has an elegant manner she is no screaming cowering victim she is actually a bit icy and patrician albeit impecunious this makes her character s plight all the more believable surely the single most fascinating element is the casting of dame may witty she was and is probably most famous for the charming title character in the lady vanishes she has a sweet manner and a harmless slightly dithering manner but here she is far from a heroine george macready is excellent as her extremely troubled son the whole cast in fact is superb it seems that this famous and brilliant movie was made almost by accident undoubtedly the director knew exactly what he was doing but he did it on a low budget that is the thrill and charm of film noir the real film noir it is small convincingly lowlife and in this case unforgettable
this was a hilarious movie and i would see it again and again it isn t a movie for someone who doesn t have a fun sense of a humor but for people who enoy comedy like chris rock its a perfect movie in my opinion it is really funnny
this sweeping drama has it all top notch acting incredible photography good story it is often compared to braveheart because both movies take place in historical scotland even though i love braveheart i think this is the better of the two films jessica lange gave an incredible performance should have been nominated for an oscar liam neeson is fantastic in the title role tim roth plays one of the most evil despicable characters in film history he was nominated for an oscar john hurt is excellent as lord montrose another dislikeable character i am always amazed at the incredible range of characters that john hurt can play this is a story of a dispute over money between rob roy and his clan and lord montrose rob roy is a self made man who will not solve his problems with montrose if it violates his sense of honor montrose who inherited his title has no sense of honor and that is basically what this story is all about honor of the common man versus corruption of the nobility this movie is very entertaining it should appeal to all it has romance action beautiful scenery and has a exciting plot one of my favorite films
this is a very good movie do you want to know the real reasons why so many here are knocking this movie i will tell you in this movie you have a black criminal who outwits a white professor a black cop who tells the white professor he is wrong for defending the black criminal and the black cop turns out to be right thus making the white professor look stupid it always comes down to race this is an excellent movie pay no attention to the racist if you can get over that there are characters who are played by blacks in this movie who outsmart the white characters then you shouldn t have any problems enjoying this movie i recommended everyone to go see this movie
how can you resist watching a film with some swing it s a delightful little film full of wonderful actors and a wonderful story line too bad they don t tour out here i d go see them see it if for no other reason than to hear some good music
not often have i had the feeling of a movie it could be visionary but clearly this movie has the seed of a premonition we should not tend to be alarmists and see armageddon in something because it seems to fit our emotions of the moment but didn t we say this of had james orwell known the internet becoming reality not long after in fact it was in he might have reconsidered writing his story the way he did hindsight rewarded it doesn t matter what does matter is that we often regard ourselves as superior to our surroundings but indeed become emotional about a love apple when necessity knocks at our door a snapshot of ourselves at old age whatever the time line will prove to be for us i know for a fact we haven t seen the beginning of it yet
it s a bit easy that s about it the graphics are clean and realistic except for the fact that some of the fences are d but that s forgiveable the rest of the graphics are cleaner than goldeneye and many other n games the sounds are magnificant everything from the speaking to the sfx are pleasant and realistic the camera angle is a bit frustrating at times but it s the same for every platform game like banjo kazooie and donkey kong i got this game as a christmas present in and since then i have dutifully gotten stars over times
in mexico this movie was aired only in paytv dietrich bonhoeffer s life is a true example about a good german and specially about a good man the conversations between tukur s character and the nazi prosecutor are specially interesting a true ideas war two different germans both with faith in there believes bonhoeffer was a very complex person man freedom fighter boyfriend churchman and a great intellectual ulrich tukur is outstanding as bonhoeffer i recommended this film a lot specially in this difficult times for the planet in mexico we don t know a lot about pastor bonhoeffer life and legacy this is a great work for rescue a forgotten hero

i ve seen this movie at theater when it first came out some years ago and really liked it a lot but i still wanted to see it again this year to check if it is still good compared to movies coming out now and i wan tell it s one the best movies i ve ever seen in my life what you need to know is that you don t have to miss any minute of this movie if you don t completely follow the action you will get lost and you will not understand the end the end is what makes this movie so good you can t expect it congratulations to the producer
red eye is a good little thriller to watch on a saturday night intense acting great villain and unexpected action some might not want to see this movie because it goes for a very short min s and of the movie is on a plane and just talking don t worry they pull it off very well with the smart and witty dialog a pg movie seems to be new grounds for director wes craven but surely enough he has fit as much violence as he possibly can into this thriller this movies strongest point is its cast this film needed good actors to deliver the dialog and thrills if they didn t have those actors the film would have been lost and boring we had rachel mcadams from mean girls and wedding crashers cillian murphy from batman begins and days later rounding off this cast is brian cox from x men the pacing in this film was great just when your thinking its going to get boring they throw a twist at you luckily this isn t a long movie and doesn t feel like it either much better then the other flight movie flight plan here is my flight plan comment http www imdb com title tt usercomments i recommend not too long and not too shabby
it s amazing that so many people that i know haven t seen this little gem everybody i have turned on to it have come back with the same reaction what a great movie i ve never much cared for brad pitt though his turns in monkeys and fight club show improvement but his performance in this film as a psycho is unnerving dark and right on target everyone else in the film gives excellent performances and the movie s slow and deliberate pacing greatly enhance the proceedings the sense of dread for the characters keeps increasing as they come to realize what has been really happening the only thing that keeps this from a in my book is that compared to what came before it the ending is a bit too long and overblown but that s the only flaw i could find in this cult classic if you check this film out try to get the letterboxed unrated director s cut for the best viewing option rating
that certain thing is the story of a gold digger viola dana from a tenement house her mother uses her to take care of her two brothers but they are a loving family although dana s character has the opportunity to marry a streetcar conductor she refuses and holds out for a millionaire everyone makes fun of her for her fantasy but are surprised when one day she really does meet a millionaire son of the owner of the popular abc restaurant chain the two marry hastily but the girl s dreams of wealth are shattered when the rich father disowns his son for marrying a gold digger however she truly loves her new husband and the two are unexpectedly successful at making it on their own a rare glimpse of movie star viola dana this film is a lot of fun dana s role is accessible natural and entertaining she displays a knack for comedy as well as an ability to do drama the mechanics of the film are a lot of fun too the camera displays sophisticated late silent techniques like mobility the title cards are also incredibly clever if you like films like my best girl it or the patsy you will enjoy this film
when i think about this movie all the adjectives that come to mind somehow relate to the physical appreciation of the world texture smell color that s how i think this movie should be judged in terms of see the rich golden tones surrounding the young concubine asleep by the fireplace or the sweltering turkish bath and let it flood your senses with impressions of spice coarse cloth smooth skin scented oils flickering flames satin rustle don t just watch and listen be absorbed let the droning voice of the storyteller mesmerize you
ed harris s work in this film is up to his usual standard of excellence that is he steals the screen away from anyone with whom he shares it and that includes the formidable sean connery the movie which is more than a bit sanctimonious comes alive only in the scenes when harris is interrogated by the attorney for another convict it is breathtaking a master class in artistic control the other cast members are all adept and connery is reliable as is fishbourne but the story itself packs no wallop the plot depends largely on the premise that a black prisoner always will be mistreated and coerced by white law enforcement officers this is the engine which drives the story right or wrong and makes one feel a tad cheated at the end still worth watching to see harris in action
the great cinematic musicals were made between and this twenty year spell can be rightly labelled the golden era of the genre there were musicals prior to that and there have been musicals since but the true classics seem invariably to have been made during that period singin in the rain an american in paris the band wagon seven brides for seven brothers oklahoma south pacific the king and i and many more stand tall as much cherished products of the age perhaps the last great musical of the golden era is carol reed s oliver freely adapted from dickens novel this vibrant musical is a film version of a successful stage production it is a magnificent film winner of six oscars including the best picture award orphan oliver twist mark lester lives a miserable existence in a workhouse his mother having died moments after giving birth to him following an incident one meal time he is booted out of the workhouse and ends up employed at a funeral parlour but oliver doesn t settle particularly well into his new job and escapes after a few troubled days he makes the long journey to london where he hopes to seek his fortune oliver is taken under the wing of a child pickpocket called the artful dodger jack wild who in turn works for fagin ron moody an elderly crook in charge of a gang of child thieves despite the unlawful nature of the job oliver finds good friends among his new family he also makes the acquaintance of nancy shani wallis girlfriend of the cruellest and most feared thief of them all the menacing bill sikes oliver reed after many adventures oliver discovers his true ancestry and finds that he is actually from a rich and well to do background but his chances of being reunited with his real family are jeopardised when bill sikes forcibly exploits oliver making him an accomplice in some particularly risky and ambitious robberies oliver is a brilliantly assembled film consistently pleasing to the eye and excellently acted by its talented cast moody recreates his stage role with considerable verve stealing the film from the youngsters with his energetic performance as fagin lester and wild do well too as the young pickpockets while wallis enthusiastically fleshes out the nancy role and reed generates genuine despicableness as sikes the musical numbers are staged with incredible precision and sense of spectacle onna white s oscar winning choreography helps make the song and dance set pieces so memorable but the lively performers and the skillful direction of carol reed also play their part the unforgettable tunes include food glorious food consider yourself you ve got to pick a pocket or two i d do anything and oom pah pah all immensely catchy songs conveyed via very well put together sequences the film is a thoroughly entertaining experience and never really loses momentum over its entire minute duration sit back and enjoy
i went into this film thinking it would be a crappy b rated movie i came out surprised and very amused eva was good but lake bell stole the show she had amazing comedic timing the jokes in this film were surprisingly original and really funny with one or two flat jokes in between the plot was enough to tie it all together a woman eva dies on her wedding day and comes back to haunt the woman that is going out with her was to be husband its sounds far fetched but it actually works quite well overall its a worthwhile cinema watch if not get it on dvd when it comes out

kiera nightly moved straight from the p p set to this action movie she could hardly have chosen to remake her image more dramatically a great success in love actually and as lizie in jane austen s classic she is once again having a go just as her bikini clad warrier woman in king arthur was more skin than muscle it is difficult to imagine this delicate frame standing up to a bounty hunters life but then this is exactly what domino harvey the real one did and i being one of nightly s biggest fans believe she carries if off stuff for the non american world is the post code of beverly hills in la where all the film stars live domino harvey father s mostfamous film was manchurian candidate which appears in the film domino harvey died of a drug overdose in her bath before the film came out in june after having been arrested for drug dealing she had just completed the negotiation for some of her music to be inlcuded in the film kiera knightly alludes to domino harvey s sexuality in her interview with lucy liu if you find this film a bit far fetched then check out domino harvey as the facts are more amazing than the fiction
there is no doubt that during the decade of the s the names of boris karloff and bela lugosi became a sure guarantee of excellent performances in high quality horror films after being universal s first monster in the seminal classic dracula bela lugosi became the quintessential horror villain thanks to his elegant style and his foreign accent sadly this last factor would also led him to be type casted during the s in the same way boris karloff s performance in james whale s frankenstein transformed him into the man to look for when one wanted a good monster of course it was only natural for these icons to end up sharing the screen and the movie that united them was s the black cat this formula would be repeated in several films through the decade and director lambert hillyer s mix of horror and science fiction the invisible ray is another of those minor classics they did in those years in the invisible ray dr janos rukh boris karloff is a brilliant scientist who has invented a device able to show scenes of our planet s past captured in rays of light coming from the galaxy of andromeda while showing his invention to his colleagues dr felix benet bela lugosi and sir francis stevens walter kingsford they discover that thousands of years ago a meteor hit in what is now nigeria after this marvelous discovery dr rukh decides to join his colleagues in an expedition to africa looking for the landing place of the mysterious meteor this expedition won t be any beneficial for rukh as during the expedition his wife diane frances drake will fall in love with ronald drake frank lawton an expert hunter brought by the stevens to aid them in their expedition however rukh will lose more than his wife in that trip as he ll be forever changed after being exposed to the invisible ray of the meteor written by john colton who previously did the script for werewolf of london the invisible ray had its roots on an original sci fi story by howard higgin and douglas hodges given that this was a movie with karloff and lugosi colton puts a lot of emphasis on the horror side of his story playing in a very effective way with the mad scientist archetype and adding a good dose of melodrama to spice things up one element that makes the invisible ray to stand out among other horror films of that era is the way that colton plays with morality through the story that is there aren t exactly heroes and villains in the classic style but people who make decisions and later face the consequences of those choices in many ways the invisible ray is a modern tragedy about obsessions guilt and revenge a seasoned director of low budget b movies filmmaker lambert hillyer got the chance to make films for universal pictures when the legendary studio was facing serious financial troubles thanks to his experience working with limited resources hillyer s films were always very good looking despite the budgetary constrains and the invisible ray was not an exception while nowhere near the stylish gothic atmosphere of previous universal horror films hillyer s movie effectively captures the essence of colton s script as he gives this movie a dark and morbid mood more in tone with pulp novels than with straightforward sci fi finally a word must be said about hillyer s use of special effects for an extremely low budget film they look a lot better than the ones in several a movies of the era as usual in a movie with lugosi and karloff the performances by this legends are of an extraordinary quality as the film s protagonist boris karloff is simply perfect in his portrayal of a man so blinded by the devotion to his work that fails to see the evil he unleashes as his colleague dr benet bela luogis is simply a joy to watch stealing every scene he is in and showing what an underrated actor he was as rukh s wife frances drake is extremely effective truly helping her character to become more than a damsel in distress still two of the movie highlights are the performances of kemble cooper as mother rukh and beulah bondi as lady arabella as the two actresses make the most of their limited screen time making unforgettable their supporting roles frank lawton is also good in his role but nothing surprising when compared to the rest of the cast if one judges this movie under today s standards it s very easy to dismiss it as another cheap science fiction film with bad special effects and carelessly jumbled pseudoscience however that would be a mistake as despite its low budget it is remarkably well done for its time on the top of that considering that the movie was made when the nuclear era was about to begin and radioactivity was still a relatively new concept it s ideas about the dangers of radioactivity are frighteningly accurate one final thing worthy to point out is the interesting way the script handles the relationships between characters specially the friendship and rivalry that exists between the obsessive dr rukh and the cold dr benet as this allows great scenes between the two iconic actors while nowhere near the gothic expressionism of the frankenstein movies nor the elegant suspense of the black cat lambert hillyer s the invisible ray is definitely a minor classic amongst universal pictures catalog of horror films with one of the most interesting screenplays of s horror this mixture of suspense horror and science fiction is one severely underrated gem that even now delivers a good dose of entertainment courtesy of two of the most amazing actors the horror genre ever had boris karloff and bela lugosi
i saw a special advance screening of this today i have to let you know i m not a huge fan of either dane cook or steve carell so i really had no expectations going into this i ended up enjoying it quite a bit dan in real life is the story of a widower with daughters who goes to spend a weekend with his family while at a bookstore he meets the woman of his dreams only to find out that she happens to be his brother s girlfriend this movie is pretty well made the soundtrack cinematography and acting are all top notch especially steve carell my problem with it was mostly that there seemed to be a lack of character development mostly with dane cook s character we never really get a close look at the relationship between dane and steve s characters and i felt that it could have helped a bit in showing what dan s inner conflict about being in love with dane s girlfriend was like other than this though dan in real life is definitely a solid sweet film definitely a nice break from all the horror and action movies we ve been getting this year
it s a rehash of many recent films only this one has fewer stars lesser complications and a more fuzzy feel to it abhay and ritika played by fardeen khan esha deol respectively meet at a friend s wedding where their own marriage unbeknowst to them begins its process of being arranged within no time the two strangers are married and sent of to a honeymoon camp where they meet other couples going through the motions similar to theirs as they spend time together secrets are revealed hearts broken and or mended and love blossoms if you ve seen honeymoon private limited and or salaam e ishq then you ve seen this film the plot twists are the same there is not a single element of surprise in the entire two and a half hours of the film everything is predictable i only enjoyed it because i had seen darling also starring the leads deol khan earlier in the day and enjoyed their chemistry in that so i said why not when my sister suggested we rent just married as well see it because kirron kher co stars and is her usual darling self in it skip it because you ve had enough of all this couple fest nonsense c
how this has not become a cult film i do not know i think it has been sadly overlooked as a truly ingenious comedy runaway car attempts to pass itself off as a fast paced thriller but taking the quality of acting good god it s bad the storyline the practicalities of the car s demonic possession and the baby evacuation scene into account there is nothing you can really do but laugh and laugh you will films are made to entertain us and the degree to which they do this can be an indication of a film s worth this film is the pinnacle in entertainment i laughed from beginning to end at one point i got short of breath and nearly choked it really is that funny at some points when the baby was airlifted out of the sunroof in a holdall by a helicopter with a robot pilot who managed to maintain a constant velocity identical to the car and a perfectly flat flight plain that meant the grapple hook didn t rip the car roof to pieces i was laughing hysterically but when the baby starting swinging around in the air nearly hit a bridge and almost got tangled up in a tree tears were running down my face it also occurred to me that the black cop was the guy who played jesus in madonna s like a prayer video he seems to get everywhere
an extra is called upon to play a general in a movie about the russian revolution however he is not any ordinary extra he is serguis alexander former commanding general of the russia armies who is now being forced to relive the same scene which he suffered professional and personal tragedy in to satisfy the director who was once a revolutionist in russia and was humiliated by alexander it can now be the time for this broken man to finally win his penultimate battle this is one powerful movie with meticulous direction by von sternberg providing the greatest irony in alexander s character in every way he can jannings deserved his oscar for the role with a very moving performance playing the general at his peak and at his deepest valley powell lends a sinister support as the revenge minded director and brent is perfect in her role with her face and movements showing so much expression as jannings love all around brilliance rating
interesting way of looking at how we as humans so often behave we are sometimes blinded by our desire to achieve perfection that we some times destroy the foundation of what we are trying to achieve it also addresses the issue how we tend to ignore those among us who are not as outspoken and by doing this may miss out on a great opportunity the injection of comedy also makes watching the film an enjoyable experience a must see for anyone who is interested in a reflective yet comical look at life i am eagerly looking forward to your next product hope that you will continue to provide us with quality entertainment excellent work joanne
if you get it it s magnificent if you don t it s decent please understand that getting it does not necessarily mean you ve gone through a school shooting there is so much more to this movie that at times the school shooting becomes insignificant above all it s a movie about acceptance both superficially of a traumatic event but also of people who are different for whatever reason it s also a movie about unendurable pain and how different people endure it in this case the contrast between alicia s rage and deanna s obsession creates an atmosphere of such palpable anxiety that halfway through the movie we wonder how the director could possibly pull a happy ending out of his hat thankfully the audience is given credit for being human beings our intelligence is not insulted by a sappy implausibly moralistic ending above and beyond that i try to keep a clear head about movies being fiction and all that yet i must admit i cried like a lost little baby during this movie there were certain things about it that hit very close to home and opened up some old wounds that never quite healed but that is not necessarily a bad thing
the original title means the birth of the octopuses i must confess that i do not quite understand this title the english title is water lilies but after having written this i read the comment by another user the title in french is also suggestive prieuve or octopus suggest an individual having to juggle many pressures simultaneously thanks for your explanation the basic theme is the first sexual emotions of girls when it is not clear if they are directed toward the same or the other sex it is no different for boys i think that both floriane and marie will eventually have heterosexual feelings without any admixtures much of the movie is water ballet sometimes the girls will have their heads downwards and nothing above the water except their feet and lowers legs with which they will wave and kick in the air to people like me who had never seen such things before it was fascinating floriane is the leader of one team of water lilies marie tells her that she would like to see when floriane is training this seems to be their first contact that is not just ordinary soon they will walk together floriane takes marie to a garage where a boy is waiting for her and then goes away with him for an hour while marie is waiting for her to return i took for granted that the couple slept with each other but we will later learn from the movie that they do less than that i can supply some information which few users will find elsewhere there is a scene in which marie secretly steals floriane s garbage bag in it she finds an apple mostly eaten and marie proceeds to eat the rest there is a parallel scene in another movie kazetachi no gogo afternoon breezes by hitoshi yazaki japan this is about adult young females and a clearly lesbian woman is vainly in love with a heterosexual woman she also steals a garbage bag of the beloved and also finds a more or less eaten apple and eats the rest later floriane tells marie that she would like to have her first orgasm from her marie says she cannot do this but still later marie says that she is indeed willing to do it and she masturbates on floriane there is no nudity in this scene probably only a female director could have made such a fine psychological show or study of i would like to quote baudelaire les amours enfantines floriane is played by ad le haenel who made the excellent performance as the autistic girl in the little devils by christophe ruggia a very underrated movie
cult classics are nearly impossible to predict who could guess that vision quest fight club and a space oddysey movies that were panned by critics and audiences alike upon their release would become immensely popular like many imdbers i consider myself a movie expert unlike the majority of those who hated envy evidenced by a dismal rating i found envy to be one of the funniest movies in the last decade the plot of the movie is ridiculous the dialogue isn t clever the scenes have little continuity and the script seems like it was written by a fourth grader but that s exactly why the movie is so hilarious you see in order to appreciate the accidental genius of envy you have to enjoy the movie from an ironically detached point of view why do i love envy because the movie is bad to the point that it becomes good this is the recipe for a cult classic and envy definitely fits the bill
this is the movie for those who believe cinema is the seventh art not an entertainment business lars von trier creates a noir atmosphere of post war germany utterly captivating you get absorbed into the dream and you re let go only at the end credits the plot necessarily comes second but it still is a thrilling story with tough issues being raised just wonderful
the film s design seems to be the alpha and omega of some of the major issues in this country u s we see relationships all over at the university setting for the film befittingly the obvious of student v s teacher is present but what the film adds to its value is its other relationships male v s female white v s black and the individual v s society but most important of all and in direct relation to all of the other relationships is the individual v s himself i was amazed at how bilateral a point of view the director gave to showing the race relations on campus most films typically show the injustices of one side while showing the suffering of the other this film showed the injustices and suffering of both sides it did not attempt to show how either was right although i would say the skin heads were shown a much crueler and vindictive quite obvious towards the end the film also discusses sex and rape it is ironically this injustice that in some ways brings the two races together for a time lawrence fishburne does an over the top performance as the sagacious profesor phipps he crumbles the idea of race favortism and instead shows the parallelism of the lazy and down trodden with the industrious and positive other stars that make this film are omar epps ice cube and jennifer connelly michael rapaport gives an excellent portrayal of a confused youth with misplaced anger who is looking for acceptance tyra banks make her film debut and proves supermodels can act higher learning gets its name in showing college as more than going to class and getting a piece of paper in fact i would say the film is almost a satire in showing students interactions with each other rather than some dry book as the real education at a university it is a life learning process not a textual one i think you ll find higher learning is apropos to the important issues at many universities and even life in general
there are four great movie depicting the vietnam war they are in no particular order apocalypse now born on the fourth of july platoon and finally tigerland all but tigerland focus on the actual war and the men in it tigerland focuses on men in advanced training for the vietnam war the character of boz is one of the most important depictions of a man questioning war and the absurdity of it this has been done in many war movies but rarely in boot camp also this is a very complex character whose method with dealing with his feeling and emotions are the driving force of this movie the character of boz makes this movie so good it is a shame it did not get a major release it belongs on the shelf of any movie fan alongside the aforementioned movie titles
i really like this show that is why i was disappointed to learn recently that george lopez is a racist and that he fired masiela lusha off the show simply because he discovered that she wasn t a latino emigrant but was an emigrant from albania i learned this from people on the show she was really one of the better parts of the show and thus to learn that even among those who you would think would be sensitive to racism that they can also hate someone just because of the country where they were born is really disappointing i really like this show that is why i was disappointed to learn recently that george lopez is a racist and that he fired masiela lusha off the show simply because he discovered that she wasn t a latino emigrant but was an emigrant from albania i learned this from people on the show she was really one of the better parts of the show and thus to learn that even among those who you would think would be sensitive to racism that they can also hate someone just because of the country where they were born is really disappointing
noni hazlehurst s tour de force performance which won her an afi award is at least on par with her effort in fran three years later colin friels is also good and for those who are interested alice garner appears as noni s child and michael caton best known for the castle is a bearded painter also interestingly hazlehurst is currently the host of lifestyle program better homes and gardens and caton is the host of property type programs including hot property hot auction etc this film reaffirms the popularly held belief that noni was arguably australia s top female actor during the early to mid s rating
otto preminger s noir classic works almost as a flip side of laura while that film was glitzy and features the high fa luting clifton webb this film is a whole lot seamier dana andrews is a less than good cop who accidentally kills a man only to have it potentially pinned on the father of the girl he loves preminger keeps things moving at a brisk clip so that lapses in logic are easily overlooked andrews is quite fine a lot less wooden than he s been in the past and the stunningly beautiful gene tierney is stunningly beautiful creepy craig stevens plays the unlucky victim where the sidewalk ends is a must see and a terrific companion piece to preminger s equally lurid whirlpool also starring tierney
gotta start with ed furlong on this one you gotta god bless this kid bucks says the character he plays in this film is what he s really like in real life he has a one liner or two that made me almost blow snot because of the subtle humor in the script you know all the trials this guy has gone through in recent years and it doesn t even seem like furlong is even acting maybe that s why his performance was good same with madsen you keep thinking i bet this guy is really like this in real life does madsen even have to act just natural vosloo has obviously moved on from the type casted mummy guy i think the biggest surprise to this film was jordana spiro s performance her reactions are spot on in this film i battled if she was hot or not but realized i would just like to see more of her not a big fan of shoot em out hostage type films but what i am a fan of are films with lots of twists and turns to try and keep you guessing it s not just your standard robbers take over a bank they kill hostages and the good guys win in the end type of film the twists keep on coming and coming the caf scenes work best with the hand held cams to show what it s really like in there not glossed over a bit think like bourne ultimatum lite style on some scenes in the caf and for those bo bice fanatics out there actor curtis wayne who plays karl will make you do a double take these guys are twins as i watched i wondered why some of the actors had foreign accents and what were they doing in this small town made sense in the end that these people smuggled stuff to other countries states so they might have these accents but more is revealed in the bonus features of how some of the producers wanted to make this film for international audiences with some of their stars we might not have heard of and some of them are smoking hot moncia dean need i say more
passport to pimlico is a real treat for all fans of british cinema not only is it an enjoyable and thoroughly entertaining comedy but it is a cinematic flashback to a bygone age with attitudes and scenarios sadly now only a memory in british life stanley holloway plays pimlico resident arthur pemberton who after the accidental detonation of an unexploded bomb discovers a wealth of medieval treasure belonging to the th century duke of burgundy that has been buried deep underneath their little suburban street these last years accompanying the treasure is an ancient legal decree signed by king edward iv of england which has never been officially rescinded to state that that particular london street had been declared burgandian soil which means that in the eyes of international law pemberton and the other local residents are no longer british subjects but natives of burgundy and their tiny street an independent country in it s own right and a law unto itself this sets the war battered and impoverished residents up in good stead as they believe themselves to be outside of english law and jurisdiction so in an act of drunken defiance they burn their ration books destroy and ignore their clothing coupons flagrantly disregard british licencing laws etc declaring themselves fully independent from britain however what then happens is ever spiv black marketeer and dishonest crook follows suit and crosses the border into burgundy as a refuge from the law and post war restrictions to sell their dodgy goods and half of london s consumers follow them in order to dodge the ration making their quiet happy little haven a den of thieves and a rather crowded one at that appealing to whitehall for assistance they are told that due to developments this is now a matter of foreign policy which his majesty s government is reluctant to become involved which leaves the residents high and dry they do however declare the area a legal frontier and as such set up a fully equipped customs office at the end of the road mainly to monitor smuggling than to ensure any safety for the residents of pimlico eventually the border is closed altogether starting a major siege with the bugundian residents slowly running out of water and food but never the less fighting on in true british style as one bugundian resident quotes we re english and we always were english and it s just because we are english we are fighting so hard to be bugundians a sentiment that is soon echoed throughout the capital as when the rest of london learn of the poor bugundians plight they all feel compelled to chip in and help them by throwing food and supplies over the barbed wire blockades will whitehall who has fought off so may invaders throughout the centuries finally be brought to it s knees by this new batch of foreigners especially as these ones are english great tale and great fun throughout not to be missed
we always watch american movies with their particular accents from each region south west etc we have the same here all foreign people must to watch this movie and need to have a open mind to accept another culture besides american and european almost dominate the cinematographic industry this movie tell us about a parallel world which it isn t figured even for those who live in a big city like s o paulo all actors are improvising and they are very realistic the camera give us an idea of their confuse world the loneliness of each character and invite us to share their world it s a real great movie and worst a rent even have it at home
a must see by all if you have to borrow your neighbors kid to see this one easily one of the best animation cartoons released in a long time it took the the movies antz to a whole new level do not mistake the two as being the same movie although in principle the movies plot is similiar just go and enjoy
i did not like the pretentious and overrated apocalypse now probably my favorite vietnam war film is the deer hunter the deer hunter focused on one part of the war and then focused on the lives before the war this movie is essentially deer hunter the script is too loose compared to the deer hunter the story is never developed to the point that the audience can truly understand and feel for the characters like the deerhunter did the vietnam flashbacks are not as gripping or involved as the ones in the deerhunter this is why i can only give this movie out of however i think that the acting was outstanding deniro and harris are truly amazing actors they totally immersed themselves in their characters and expressed the great anguish of two former friends who lost their best friend bobby in combat harris character is a half dead alcoholic who hides the guilt that he has in bobby losing his life trying to save his i also like the supporting cast everyone in the town is part of the movie the town obviously can t handle vietnam vets very well like many small towns it is all about being quiet humble and minding one s business harris character however can t be any of these things it is interesting how wars effect people some people rebound quickly while others never really recover
pinjar is truly a masterpiece it s a thought provoking film that makes you think and makes you question our culture it is without a doubt the best hindi movie i have seen to date this film should have been shown at movie festivals around the world and i believe would have been a serious contender at cannes all the characters were perfectly cast and urmila matkondar and manoj bhajpai were haunting in their roles the story the movie tells about partition is a very very important story and one that should never be forgotten it has no biases or prejudices and has given the partition a human story here no one country is depicted as good or bad there are evil indians evil pakistanis and good indians and pakistanis the cinematography is excellent and the music is melodious meaningful and haunting everything about the movie was amazing and the acting just took my breath away all were perfectly cast
i am curious yellow a film in near seussical rhyme is said right at the start to be available in two versions yellow and blue was one of those big art house hits that first was a major sensation in sweden then a big scandal cause celebre in the united states when the one print was held by customs and it went all the way to the supreme court what s potent in the picture today is not so much what might offend by way of what s revealed in the sex or nudity the director actor vilgot sjoman films the various scenes in such a way that there is an abundance of flesh and genitalia and the occasional graphic bit but it s always more so an intellectual expression than very lust like but the daring of the attempt at a pure metafilm while at the same time making a true statement on the state of affairs in sweden who knew such things in a generally peaceful country i e usually neutral in foreign affairs and wars could be so heated up politically at least that s part of sjoman s aim here like a filmmaker such as dusan makavajev with some of his works like w r if not as surreal and deranged or to a slightly lesser extent bertolucci sjoman is out to mix politics and sex mostly politics and social strata around in the midst of also making it a comment on embodying a character in a film the two characters lena and borje have a hot cold relationship in the story of the film where lena is a curious socialist wannabe who demonstrates in the street for nonviolence and trains sort of in a cabin in the woods to become a fully functioning one while at the same time maybe too curious about her car salesman boyfriend and as this is going on which is by itself enough for one movie sjoman inserts himself and his crew from time to time as they are making this story on film there s even a great bit midway through where as if at a rock concert title cards fill in during a break in shooting who the crew are negating having to use end credits then with this there s a whole other dynamic as sjoman gives an actual performance not just a hey i m the director playing the director bit at first one might not get this structure and that i am curious yellow is just a film where lena is a documentary interviewer asking subjects about their thoughts on class socialism spain and franco and once in a while we see lena s father or bjore but sjoman does something interesting the structure is so slippery as the viewer one has to stay on toes it s impressive that so many years on a picture can surprise with not being afraid to mix dramatic narrative documentary film within a film and even a serious interview with martin luther king who also acts as a quasi guru for lena it might not always be completely coherent analysis politically but it doesn t feel cheating or even with much of a satirical agenda like in a godard picture the satire sjoman is after is akin to a godard but on a whole other wavelength his anarchy is playful but not completely loaded with semantics or tricks that could put off the less initiated viewer if i am curious yellow stands up as an intellectual enterprise and a full blown trip into exploring sex in a manner that was and is captivating for how much is shown and how comfortable it all seems to be for the actors it isn t entirely successful i think as an emotional experience where bergman had it down to a t with making a purely emotional film with deconstruction tendencies sjoman is more apt at connecting with specific ideas while not actually directing always very well when it comes time to do big or subtle scenes with the actors occasionally it works if only for the actors lena nyman mostly spectacular here in a performance that asks of her to make an ambitious but confused kid into someone sympathetic and vulnerable even and borje ahlstedt a great realistic counterpoint to the volatile lena but some years later its hard to completely connect with everything that happens in the inner film of lena and borje since perhaps intentionally sjoman fills it up with clich s borje has a girlfriend and kid will he leave her how will lena reconcile her father and a heavy handed narration from his starlet of sorts and yet for whatever faults sjoman may have ironically considering he means it to be a comment on itself i am curious yellow holds up beautifully as an artistic experiment in testing the waters of what could be done in swedish cinema or testing what couldn t be and bending it for provocative and comedic usage i d even go as far as to say it s influential and has probably been copied or imitated in more ways than one due to it being such a cult phenomenon at its time a specific technique used with the film rewinding towards the end is echoed in poorer usage in funny games and should be seen by anyone looking into getting into avant garde or meta film making if it s not quite as outstanding an artistic leap as w r or last tango it s close behind
the latest film by the spanish director agusti villaronga is a study on how children that experience violence and isolation within their remote community develop into troubled young adults that need certain psychic tools to deal with their hidden mental frailty whether these tools are religion followed to a fanatical level caring for others or simply putting on a macho image whilst engaging as a male prostitute villaronga creates a successful examination of how these vices affect three teenagers living in spain under franco the three witness the disturbing double death or their friends before they are teenagers and subsequently bury the emotions they feel with their peers frail corpses until they meet again once more at a hospital for those suffering form tuberculosis the cinematic style of the text is typically visually opulent as you would expect from the spanish auteur and is extremely reminiscent of fellow spaniard pedro almodovar s work with themes dealing with sexual desire both heterosexual and homosexual an element that is different between the two directors is that villaronga favours a supernatural undertone spliced with claustrophobic gritty realism opposed to almodovar s use of surrealism although both styles are similar the piece gives an insight into troubled young psyche and contains disturbing violence and scenes of a sexual nature i highly recommend watching this film as it contains elements that will remain with the audience for a considerable period after viewing
the groove tube was one of only two ken shapiro movies the other one being the equally zany modern problems this one is just a full scale parody of tv aside from shapiro who apparently didn t do anything after modern problems the movie also stars chevy chase and henry winkler s cousin richard belzer the three cast members plus some other people in smaller roles appear in various skits one of the funniest ones features chase in a geritol spoofing commercial in which he s describing the medicine as his wife strips and it ends with her humping him there s also a pornographic news program an irritating cooking show and the epic tale of some drug dealers anyway the whole thing s just a real hoot in my opinion the three best tv spoofing movies are this one plus tunnelvision and kentucky fried movie although i might also include the truman show really funny i wonder what ever did become of ken shapiro
the last i believe of the movies the boys made with hal roach this is also the last truly funny film they made before going to th century fox which so famously misued their talents although there are weak moments the business with the lung tester for instance is a bit ah overblown but worth having just to see dr jimmy finlayson but on the whole this flick is a good summary of what the boys brought to the screen richard cramer uncredited appeared in other l h flicks and he is delightfully threatening here as the convict nick granger the scene where the boys have to eat their own synthetic meal looks good smells good and it probably tastes good eat it is one of my favorite moments in the oeuvre stan ollie will always be pleasant companions in the lives of their millions of devoted fans
gregory peck gives a brilliant performance in this film the last minutes or thereabouts are great and peck is an absolute joy to watch the same cannot however be said for the rest of the film it s not awful and i m sure it was made with good intentions but the only real reason if i were to be honest to see it is peck for the rest you are better off just reading the old testament
well this is probably one of the best movies i ve seen and i love it so much that i ve memorized most of the script especially the scene in the storage unit when jerry lee breaks wind and even with the script in my head i still like to watch it for jerry lee that german shepherd is hysterical and really is put to the test to see who s smarter the tag line holds true as well not to mention the acting is great though christine tucci sounds different in a whisper check filmography under csi if you don t know what i mean it s too bad that this movie only contained the single issue dooley and jerry lee had to work with it would have been pretty cool to see the tricks that zeus and welles had up their sleeve
in the opening scene the eye patch wearing desperado named hawkeye has a smooth forehead but when he follows johnny into the pueblo he s shown with a scar over his patched eye that s just one of the many continuity lapses in this edgy spaghetti western but rather than detract from the picture it adds a special flavor to the proceedings another occurs when sanchez turns in his three dead bodies they have to be examined for their identities you just can t imagine how many false cadavers we have in our town immediately after carradine lawrence dobkin shows up to collect his bounty with no more than a wanted poster in hand as for the film s principal johnny yuma mark damon he s shown with his holster alternately on his right and left hip throughout the movie after exchanging gun belts with carradine following the barroom brawl johnny s bound for san margo at his uncle s request but will have to avenge his death at the hands of deceitful wife samantha rosalba neri and her conniving brother pedro louis vanner it takes some time getting there but it s a fun ride with one of the best music scores on record as for that saloon fight i got a kick out of the kung fu sound effects every time a punch connected care for some more story exaggerations following the duel with pedro the first time johnny wipes a small amount of blood from his lip which he manages to smear pedro s entire face with similarly when pedro smacks around little pepe later in the film he doesn t cut him but by the time johnny arrives pepe s face is covered with blood johnny yuma is probably one of the best of the genre that doesn t have clint eastwood in it as johnny mark damon is a reasonably suitable stand in but without the seething exterior carradine seemed to be a replacement for the obligatory lee van cleef character without being a total bad guy at first the identity exchange between carradine and johnny didn t seem to make sense but it all tied together by the time the film ended you knew each henchman would wind up getting his due marking time for each was part of the anticipation in case you re wondering the title hero has nothing to do with the nick adams character from the classic tv western the rebel in this film johnny got his name from a gunfight he had in yuma once perhaps the most unique element of the story had to do with the way it tied things up with the evil samantha who pulled the strings behind the scenes throughout after shooting carradine she beats a hasty retreat before johnny can get his revenge still alive it looks like carradine tries to shoot her and misses but it doesn t take long for johnny and sanchez to track her into the dessert where she perished without water carradine aimed for her canteen
well it was a nice surprise after all its trailer did not predict a good film at all it was even a bit misleading especially the part of jeff bridges was a positive surprise well written sardonic and funny less real though i do not think a guy who got where he got would show signs of such irreverence towards everything that his current company stands for one does not become a top suit just to doubt it all suddenly again the ending of the film during the showing of dolce vita was too corny clich and quite disappointing and of course a guy like pegg s character would not last past his first week in a blitz new york magazine like this i hope one day i will see a decent role written for megan fox here she looked a poor actress playing a bimbo and by the way i do not see why she is the sex symbol of the year i see hotter girls on nearly every cover of every magazine
i went to this movie only because i was dragged there and i would have left again immediately because the audience consisted mainly of elderly people and i felt out of place however the film was utterly fascinating and far from being targeted towards old people the characters were all very real and believable and i found myself discussing the film the characters and the storyline for hours afterwards there are a few quite engrossing scenes in there but they are necessary and help you to understand the situation much better all in all this is a great and valuable film slightly off mainstream but that does not mean that this film cannot be enjoyed by people who prefer mainstream it s a thrilling and interesting movie experience
josef von sternberg directs this magnificent silent film about silent hollywood and the former imperial general to the czar of russia who has found himself there emil jannings won a well deserved oscar in part for his role as the general who ironically is cast in a bit part in a silent picture as a russian general the movie flashes back to his days in russia leading up to the country s fall to revolutionaries william powell makes his big screen debut as the hollywood director who casts jannings in his film the film serves as an interesting look at the fall of russia and at an imitation of behind the scenes tinseltown in the early days von sternberg delivers yet another classic and one that is filled with the great elements of romance intrigue and tragedy
batman the mystery of the batwoman is about as entertaining as animated batman movies get while still true to the feeling of the comic books the animation is done with a lighter spirit than in the animated series bruce wayne looks much like he has before but now he appears somewhat less imposing the dick grayson robin has been replaced by the less edgy more youthful tim drake robin kevin conroy as usual invokes the voice of batman better than most live action actors kelly ripa did a much more decent voice acting job than i was expecting as in the live action batman films the movie lives or dies based on the quality of the villains my all time favorite the penguin is here his design is sleeker than it has appeared before hearkening more to the burgess meredith portrayal of the s than the danny devito portrayal of batman returns david ogden stiers is the perfect choice for the penguin s voice the penguin is finally portrayed as a cunning sophisticate just as he most commonly appears in the comics hector elizondo s voice creates a bane who s much more memorable than the forgettable version in batman robin and finally batman has a descent mystery to solve putting the detective back in detective comics that is what dc stands for after all the revolution to the mystery is a delightfully sneaky twist the score adds to the mysterious ambiance of the movie it sounds like a mix between the score from poirot and the score from mission impossible all in all it s more entertaining than your average cartoon

while movie titles contains the word mother the first thing that comes to our mind will be a mother s love for her children however the mother tells a different story the mother do not discuss the love between a mother and her child or how she sacrifice herself for the benefit of her child here notting hill director roger michell tells us how a mother s love for a man about half of her age hurts the people around her before daniel craig takes on the role of james bond here he plays darren a man who is helping to renovate the house of the son of the mother and sleeping with her daughter as well anne reid who was a familiar face on tv series takes up the challenging role of the leading character may the story begins with may coping with the sudden loss of her husband toots in a family visit to her son bobby while she befriends darren a handyman who is doing some renovation in bobby s house she was shocked to found out that her daughter paula was sleeping with darren at the same time may was coping with life after the death of toots fearing that harry and paula do not wanted her may starts to find her life going off track until she spends her afternoon with darren darren was nice and friendly to may and may soon finds some affection on darren instead of treating him like a friend she treated the man who was about half her age with love of a couple later may found sexual pleasure from darren where he gave her the pleasure she could never find on anyone else and this is the beginning of the disaster that could lead to the break down of a family the mother explores the inner world of a widow who wanted to try something she never had in her life and solace on someone who is there for her to shoulder on this can be told from may buying tea time snacks for darren to fulfilling sexual needs from a man younger than her where it eventually gave her more than she bargained for anne reid has made a breakthrough for her role of may as she was previously best well known for her various role on tv series as she do not have much movies in her career resume the mother has put her on the critic s attention daniel craig on the other hand had took on a similar role in his movie career such as sylvia and enduring love if his reprising role of james bond fails film reviewers should not forget that he has a better performance in small productions in his years of movie career and the mother is one of them the mother may not be everyone s favorite but it is definitely not your usual matin e show to go along with tea and scones accompanied by butter and jam
i always tell people that enchanted april is an adult movie with no cussing no sex and no violence one might think of it as the ultimate chick flick but i bet there are one or two enlightened men out there who love it too don t invite the kids though this movie is very low key seeing enchanted april is a very healing experience the sound track and gorgeous scenery along with the ladies gentle manners bring to mind the peace and beauty of a pre raphaelite painting lest anyone think yours truly only watches one kind of movie i will paraphrase a line i heard once on saturday night live and say that my two favorite movies are the deer hunter and enchanted april
today actresses happily gain weight dye their hair dress like slobs and lose their glamor for a role and bette davis was probably the actress who started the trend even as a pretty young woman who occasionally wore designer clothes and constance bennett type makeup in films davis was willing to ravage herself in order to create a character on the outside as well as the inside her determination is amply demonstrated here in her breakout film of human bondage in which she stars with leslie howard as philip carey davis plays mildred a slutty manipulative greedy low life to howard s masochistic club footed philip he first meets her when she s a waitress and she allows him to take her out to dinner and theater while she frolics with a wealthy older man alan hale sr in truth mildred is repulsed by philip s club foot on his part philip seems to enjoy the abuse of her open flirtation and her coolness toward him he allows mildred to bleed him dry financially in between boyfriends who drop her when they tire of her while he blows off a couple of truly lovely women kay johnson and frances dee when he gets the gumption to throw her out mildred trashes his apartment and robs him forcing him to withdraw from medical school and lose his lodgings of human bondage looks rather stilted today in parts though leslie howard was a wonderful actor and attractive his acting style is of a more formal old school and as a result he tends to date whatever he s in he shines in material like his role opposite davis in it s love i m after or the petrified forest which call for his kind of technique his dated acting is even more obvious here because davis was forging new ground with a gritty edgy performance that would really make her name if she seems at times over the top she came from the stage and the subtleties of film acting would emerge later for her contrast this performance with the restraint warmth and gentleness of her henriette in all this and heaven too or the pathos she brought to dark victory she was a true actress and a true artist davis really allows herself to look like holy hell mildred s deterioration is absolutely pathetic as philip seems to gain strength as her spirit fades an excellent film in which to see the burgeoning of one of film s greatest stars
first of all don t go into revolver expecting another snatch or lock stock this is a different sort of gangster film i saw the gala the other night and this movie definitely split the audience it s the kind of movie where half the audience will leave thinking what was that that was awful and the other half will leave thinking what was that that was cool personally i like films that i don t understand i e mullholland drive and usual suspects so i enjoyed revolver it definitely wasn t perfect though i saw the big twist coming a mile away at least part of it and though sometimes some loose ends left unexplained is good revolver leaves a lot of questions unexplained for no reason it seemed also some scenes like the animation and the scene where sorter goes on a killing spree actually one of my favourites although awesome scenes to watch seemed to just be there because they were awesome to watch not because they fit in with the movie however there were many good things too i thought the acting was superb from all the main actors jason stratham ray liotta vincent pastore and even andre benjamin who was a pleasant surprise this movie definitely kept my interest with one great suspenseful action packed scene after another when ray liotta was being held under the table wow well you have to see it the script was extremely well done and the soundtrack as with most guy ritchie films was great though a step below such movies as fight club mullholland drive and usual suspects it was still an awesome fast paced psychological action movie with many twists and turns and tons of scenes you will remember long after the movie is over
i think that that creator s of this film s concept deserves a lot more accolades than they probably ever received it isn t an oscar caliber film of course but at least for me this film has left a lasting impression since i first saw it back in in the theatre i don t think this is and hope it isn t a spoiler but imagine acting on your impulses doing the first thought that pops into your head saying the first words on your lips no restraint no conscious nothing holding you back from saying or doing the things that as intelligent adults we know we shouldn t actually say or do if anything this film only scratches the surface it doesn t go as far as it could go in a time when hollywood seems obsessed with remaking older classics to try and cash in on today wouldn t it be nice to see them remake an older film of modest success for the sake of taking it to the next level a bit further or even to explore what the original crew didn t wouldn t or couldn t deal with years ago that s just my opinion anyway o
i went into the straight story expecting a sad happy type drama with nice direction and some good acting these i got what i wasn t expecting was an allegory for the trials of human existence leave it to lynch to take a simple story about a mile trip on a lawnmower and turn it into a microcosm for the human condition if you didn t notice watch it again paying attention to the ages of the people alvin meets the terrain he s driving through the reactions people give him the kinds of discussions he has one of the first is about pregnancy and children one of the last is outside of a cemetery the last road he drives down is particulary haunting in this context as it narrows and his fear and nervousness mount the last mechanical failure could be seen as a death and the miraculous rebirth of his engine relating to an afterlife in which he achieves the desired reunion i only hope some of the people who branded this as a slow sappy melodrama take the time to watch with a more holistic attention
a young cat tries to steal back his brothers soul from death but only gets half of it and then has to go adventuring to get the other half or maybe not frankly i m not sure what happens in this film which is full of very strange very surreal images some of which parents might find disturbing ie the cats slicing off part of a pig who is traveling with them and the frying it like bacon which all three eat this is a very strange film that some have likened to hello kitty on acid i think its more like hello kitty as done by dali certainly this is more alive than destino which was directly based on his work if your up for a very off beat film that will challenge your perceptions of things then see this movie just be ready for some very strange images that will be burned into your memory forever
i didn t expect much when i rented this movie and it blew me away if you like good drama good character development that draws you into a character and makes you care about them you ll love this movie engrossing
this had a good story it had a nice pace and all characters are developed cool i ve watched a whole bunch of movies in the last two weeks and this had to be the best one i ve seen in the two weeks jason bigg s character was the best though even though it was small it was cleverly crafted from the very beginning this may be a romantic comedy and i don t like most but the writing direction performing sound design overall in all capacity just was really thought out pretty cool this film scored pretty high out of all the movie s i ve seen lately and the rest were big budget or better publicized good job in writing
this is perhaps the best rockumentary ever a british better this is spinal tap the characters are believable the plot is great and you can genuinely empathise with some of the events such as ray s problem with fitting in the band the soundtrack is excellent real period stuff even if it is in the same key you ll be humming some of the songs for days what i liked was the nearly all british cast with some of the favourite household names ray s wife is priceless the film never drags it just goes at the right pace and has some genuinely funny sections in it a generator of some really good catchphrases it s a hidden diamond
a very good movie a classic sci fi film with humor action and everything this movie offers a greater number of aliens we see the rebel alliance leaders and much of the imperial forces the emperor is somewhat an original character i liked the ewoks representing somehow the indigenous savages and the vietnamese excellent references i loved the duel between vader and luke which is the best of the saga in return of the jedi the epilogue of the first trilogy is over and the empire finally falls i also appreciated the victory celebration where it fulfills vader s redemption and returns hi into anakin skywalker spirit along with yoda and obi wan it gives a sadness and a tear the greatest scenes in star wars are among this movie when vader turns on the emperor luke watches and finds comfort in seeing obi wan yoda and his father version not hayden christenssen the next best scene is when luke rushes to strike back darth vader to protect leia there is a deep dark side of this film despite there is a good ending i felt there was much more than meets the eye and as always the john william s music will bring the classicism into star wars universe
i think part of the reason this movie was made and is aimed at us gamers who actually play all the nancy drew pc games there s been a lot of movies lately based on video games and i think this in one of them so this movie does not follow any book but it does follow parts of the games i buy and play every nancy drew games as soon as it comes out and the games are from herinteractive and are for girls who aren t afraid of a mouse and some of these games actually won parents choice gold awards they are not only fun but you can actually learn a thing or two while playing i took two of my step children with me to go see it and they loved it the yr old had started playing her first nancy drew game a day before i took her to see the movie and she was having so much fun playing the game i thought she would enjoy the movie as well and i was right she not only loved this movie but couldn t wait to get home to finish her first game and start another one my other step daughter is only and she also loved the movie but she is still a little to young too play the games yet but she enjoys watching her sister play at times just to see what s going on the games are based for children yrs and older all the games usually get pretty descent reviews and are classified as adventure games for more information on the games just check out herinterative nancy drew games so personally i thought the movie was pretty good and i will buy it when it comes out on dvd
earth big screen adaptation of the bbc discovery channel series planet earth offers quite a majestic sampling of nature in all its beauty with some truly jaw dropping moments of how the hell did they get this footage while taking in the awesome scenics of animals in their natural habitats and environmental message of the circle of life can be cruel witness a great white shark gulping down a walrus seal as a quick meal and adorable the various babies and their rents the basso profundo tones of narrator james earl jones solidifies its god s eye views and profundity culled from literally hundreds of hours of footage the only gripe comes from the fact this should have been in the imax format and could ve even gone longer oh well there s always the next time since disney studios has produced this count on a series of more to come dirs alastair fothergill mark linfield
the in cold blood was perhaps more like the real thing think about it would we really want to see the real thing but it was black and white in a color world and a lot of people didn t even know what it was and there was an opportunity to remake it for television plus if you remake it you can show some stuff not shown in the original the book in cold blood by truman capote was the first nonfiction novel truman s book was in fact not true to the real story i thought the canadian location sufficed for kansas pretty much for a tv movie look for the elements of sex drugs and rock n roll dick s womanizing perry being an aspirin junkie perry playing blues guitar
peter ustinov plays an embezzler who is just getting out of prison when the film begins as soon as he walks out the gates he immediately begins working on a scheme to once again make a bundle by stealing though this time he has his sights set pretty high this is actually one of the weak points about the film as he apparently knows nothing about computers few did back in but manages to become a computer genius literally overnight yeah right anyway he comes up with a scheme to impersonate a computer expert and obtain a job with a large american corporation so he can eventually embezzle a ton of cash considering his knowledge of computers is rudimentary it s amazing how he puts into effect a brilliant plan and manages to infiltrate the computer system and its defenses but it s a movie after all so i was able to suspend disbelief by the end of the film he and his new wife maggie smith are able to run away with a million pounds at the very end though it gets very very confusing and smith announces she s managed to actually accumulate more than two million by shrewd investing in the companies that ustinov started though she didn t realize they were all dummy companies this should mean that eventually these stocks she bought were worthless what they seem to imply and i could be guessing wrong here is that ustinov and his new partners quickly cashed in the stocks before this became known and the stocks would thereby then become worthless either way the film seems to post on a magical ending whereby no one is hurt and everyone is happy and this just didn t make much sense it s a shame really as the acting and most of the writing was great karl malden bob newhart peter ustinov and maggie smith were just wonderful if i seem to have interpreted the end let me know as the film seemed very vague in details at the end
this film is one of those that has a resounding familiarity to it it is earthy grounded and a film that will make you think and smile paul reiser and peter falk take you on a journey that you will not forget the soundtrack is beautifully varied and fitting and the film itself is like a breath of fresh air this surely deserves recognition for both the film and the actors finally a piece of art that departs from the obvious love story and the frequent special affects that are seen today never have i walked out from a movie with such deep warmth and feeling of thoughtfulness in my heart for it felt as if someone had just wrapped it in a fluffy fleece blanket to see this film is to find a real treasure and delight in it
jeopardy is a tense satisying thriller a cut above a b but not really a major production it qualifies as almost an experimental film as the studio that produced it metro was desperately looking for new kinds of films stars and directors to compete with the then new medium of television the director john sturges was an up and comer whose best years lay ahead he had just recently begun directing a level films and had already proved himself a most capable craftsman stars barbara stanwyck barry sullivan and ralph meeker were at very different phases of their careers stanwyck s glory years were behind her and yet she could still carry a film as she proves here barry sullivan as her husband was one of a dozen or so leading men who got started in films in the forties who never quite achieved the success many had hoped for him he was a fine low key actor poised but in an upper middle rather than upper class way which made him excellent in professional roles as the escaped convict who is the only person around who can save sullivan s life he is trapped under a pier and the tide is rising ralph meeker is more energetic than usual this excellent actor had the misfortune of having come to films after brando and clift he was in his way as good an actor as either of them but he lacked charisma his bargaining with stanwyck which comes down to his demanding sex in exchange for saving her husband by implication only as this is makes for an intriguing premise which had this been a different kind of film could all raised all sorts of interesting questions about stanwyck s character meeker is indeed a more exciting character than sullivan and in her scenes with him stanwyck is livelier than she is with her husband and son but as this is a formula picture not a strindberg play the possibility that stanwyck might want want to have a fling leaving aside the question of her husband s predicament remains unexplored in this sense the incoming tide doesn t quite have the effect one might have wished though the movie remains tense and highly entertaining thanks to excellent acting fine location photography nearly all of it outdoors and excellent direction by the woefully underrated mr sturges
my comment is limited generally to the first season this superb series was one of the first to be televised in color and it was highly influential in persuading americans that they had to buy a color television set which was about in the equivalent of more than today how many of us would pay that much for the privilege of watching a show transmitted by a cathode ray picture tube on a inch screen i was eleven when the series began and i watched it from the beginning watching it now years later several things come to mind first many of the story lines involve the comstock lode and the heyday of silver mining which dates to for the weapons and clothes are for the most part not authentic the haircuts are left out of the discussion that s basically a nitpick and it would have been impossible for ben to have arrived in the lake tahoe area in and to have amassed a square mile ranch in the next twenty years pioneers were still trying to solve the sierra nevada problem as late as and the gold rush did not even begin until two years later indians are not played by native american actors john ford was using native american actors in the s the bonanza producers could have easily done so thirty years later that is a major nitpick for me there are other time line problems in season mark twain appears and he is depicted as a middle aged man mark twain was years old in the stories also vacillate between pre civil war and what was more suitable for an time frame there are continuity problems over and over it is somewhat off putting too that there is so much killing in the first season in time the killing was reduced many of the episodes take a socially liberal slant which would be hard to believe given the time line but give the writers credit for anticipating the seismic shifts in the nation s attitudes beginning in the s having said all that the acting is good and i have come to conclude in my latter years that adam s character was drawn better than any other s i don t think pernell roberts ever got the credit he deserved also season reinforces the fact that dan blocker hoss was a good actor many of the stories trace real historical events the guest stars were interesting this was great family entertainment and the series stands up very well by any measure
imagine being so hampered by a bureaucracy that a one man spends year s of his life and has a mental breakdown trying to solve a mass murder case virtually by himself the murder technique is clear but a government unwilling to admit the truth let s a monster destroy dozens of lives when i think my job is stressful i merely remember the true story behind this wonder flick the devotion to duty of the main character was masterfully portrayed by rea the comic and almost tragic at times relationship between rea and the sutherland character made this one of my favorite movies of the last years the catching of one of the worst mass murderers in history had me on the edge of my seat while not nearly as well advertised and talked about as silence of the lamb s the plot was just as suspenseful rent or buy this movie today
being that i am a true product of the hip hop and electronic dance music generation this is without a doubt one of my favorite movies of all time beat street although not as authentic in some respects as wild style is a film that is guaranteed to tug the heart strings of anyone who takes pride in the culture of urban sample dj based music and electro club culture although i will admit that at times the dialogue is somewhat cheesy you can t help but feel for the characters and ultimately wish you were there for the beginnings of hip hop culture in new york city in the early eighties the b boy battle scene at the roxy nightclub a real life real time competition between the legendary rock steady crew and the nyc breakers is just as essential to a hip hop fan s archives as any classic album watch some of the breakers moves in slow motion if possible to truly appreciate the athletic and stylistic expertise of a seasoned b boy b girl all praises due to the zulu nation
the good thing about this film is that it stands alone you don t have to have seen the original unfortunately this is also it s biggest drawback it would have been nice to have included a few of the original characters in the new story and seen how their lives had developed sinclair as in the original is excellent and provides the films best comic moments as he attempts to deal with awkward and embarrassing situations but the supporting cast is not as strong as in the original movie forsyth is to be congratulated on a brave attempt to move the character on and create an original sequel but the film is ultimately flawed and lacks the warmth of the original
good story good script good casting good acting good directing good art direction good photography good sound good editing good everything put it all together and you end up with good entertainment the shame of it is that there aren t nearly enough films of this caliber being made these days we may count ourselves lucky that writers directors like john hughes are occasionally able to make their creative voices heard whenever i notice that i m watching a film for the third or fourth time and still find it thoroughly satisfying i have to conclude that something about that film is right
slaughter high is a totally ridiculous slasher flick about a high school nerd marty who gets pick on all the time by some pranksters the prank goes wrong and he ends up getting savagely burned five years later his tormentors all attend a reunion just the ten of them of course and low and behold marty murders them one after another british actress caroline munro maniac leads the cast as the heroine who dies anyway the acting is completely awful there s also no suspense at all plenty of grotesque death scenes to satisfy the gore freaks a guy s stomach explodes another female victim literally gets an acid bath a couple having sex in bed get electrocuted a guy is crushed by a tractor one girl is drowned and a doctor gets a hyperdermic needle in the eye the killer wears a decent and rather creepy jester s mask and the setting a beautiful old english castle is really nice however the dream finale is utterly pathetic all in all it s true that slaughter high is a piece of garbage but i enjoyed it only for fans of truly bad slasher flicks
so often with stephen king adaptations you just get a collection of characters reciting dialogue from the books this really captures the heart of the book maybe because they don t use large chunks of text straight from the book but it s a bit more of an improv of the events in the story a big part of its success is miko hughes as baby gage dale midkiff and denise tasha yar crosby really act like his parents there s a scene where louis is cuddling gage and they are very natural together fred gwynne is wonderful he nails the maine accent perfectly without lapsing into parody and is wise and warm just like jud should be out of
as a huge fan of the original i avoided this film like the plague when the bad reviews started coming in eight years ago but i just finished watching this film and found it to be a really pleasant surprise okay if you are looking for a retread of the original you re in for a big disappointment but if you are looking for something quite different a bit edgy and political then this is the film for you gregory is now thirty four and works as a teacher at his old comprehensive school where he s being pursued by a fellow teacher and having sexual dreams about one of his students when the student insists on meeting up with gregory a series of misadventures ensue that include torture breaking and entering and all manner of unexpected twists and turns that left me feeling elated and moved if you are looking for something original then i highly recommend this film i only wish that more people had gone to see this when it was released and seen it for what it really is
a girl s folly is a sort of half comedy half mockumentary look at the motion picture business of the mid s we get a glimpse of life at an early movie studio where we experience assembly of a set running through a scene handling of adoring movie fanatics even lunch at the commissary we are also privy to little known cinematic facts for example did you know that frequently movie actors do not know the plot of the picture in which they are working the plot of this film in essence is movie star kenneth driscoll s discovery and romancing of a budding young starlet whom he discovers while shooting on location in the country i believe the minute version i watched was abridged included on the same tape with cecil b de mille s the cheat it is a very credible film an easy watch with a large cast of extras as a bonus it includes some of best illustrated captions i have ever seen accompanying a silent movie
this movie is not schlock despite the lo fi production and its link to troma productions a dark fable for adults exploitation is a theme of sugar cookies and one wonders if the cast has not fallen prey to said theme a weird movie with enticing visuals shadows and contrast are prominent definitely worth a look especially from fans of warhol and stylish decadence through all the cruelty and wickedness a moral albeit twisted can be gleamed
a top notch columbo from beginning to end i particularly like the interaction between columbo and the killer ruth gordon as an avid columbo fan i can t recall another one in which he doesn t set up the killer at the end as he does in other episodes in this one as he s trying to determine the correct sequence of the boxes and the message that the nephew left behind it finally dawns on him the music in this episode is very good as well as it is in many of other ones
cary grant and myrna loy are perfectly cast as a middle class couple who want to build the house of their dreams it all starts out with reasonable plans and expectations both of which are blown to bits by countless complications and an explosion of the original budget there are many great laughs even if the story is somewhat thin sure to entertain fans of the stars or the late s hollywood comedy style a definite highlight comes when a contractor goes through a run down of all expenses which must have sounded quite excessive to a audience as he makes his exit he assures the client grant that perhaps he could achieve a reduction of from the total or at least but certainly hilarious
demonicus rocked you guys need to understand how hard it rocked unfortunately the words needed to explain the extent of the rocking have not been discovered for a tiny idea pop like hits of e watch death factory while on the phone with jesus wait jesus is on call waiting you re having phone sex with will smith on the primary line seriously that movie so good you need to watch it at least a times to catch all the subtleties well not so much subtleties as much as it takes the length of the movie times in order to ponder why the people at full moon are allowed to a live and b reproduce what is our world coming to
this is one to watch a few times the excellent writing shows they had to have lived this story or know someone whom did because they nailed it freebird made me relive and laugh at my misspent youth the title was a great choice great film setting story soundtrack and characters it s a biker flick but would be a shame to pigeon hole it that way funny to the bone kinda like trailer park boys in the u k if you ve never seen tpb make a point to if you like this film you will thank me i hope to see more of these characters in other films sequel could be done there s a whole lot more of the world i would like to see through their eyes
this film deals with the atrocity in derry years ago which is commonly known as bloody sunday the film is well researched acted and directed it is as close to the truth as we will get until the outcome of the saville enquiry the film puts the atrocity into context of the time it also shows the savagery of the soldiers on the day of the atrocity the disgraceful white wash that was the widgery tribunal is also dealt with overall this is an excellent drama which is moving and shocking when the saville report comes out watch this film again to see how close to the truth it is
giallo fans seek out this rare film it is well written and full of all sorts of the usual low lifes that populate these films i don t want to give anything away so i wont even say anything about the plot the whole movie creates a very bizarre atmosphere and you don t know what to expect or who to suspect recommended the only place i ve seen to get this film in english is from european trash cinema for

oliver the musical is a favorite of mine the music the characters the story it all just seems perfect in this rendition of the timeless classic novel turned stage musical director carol reed brings the broadway hit to life on the movie screen the transition from musical to movie musical is not an easy one you have to have the right voices the right set the right script and the right play all signs point to yes for this play it almost appears that it was written for the screen our story takes place in jolly old england where a boy named oliver manages to work his way out of the orphanage he winds his way through the country to london where he meets up with a group of juvenile delinquents headed by dodger the smart talking quick handed pick pocket the leader of this gang is named fagin an older fellow who sells all the stolen goods but all is not well in london town when bill sykes played by oliver reed and his loving girlfriend nancy get tangled up with oliver fagin and his young troops and the law what ensues is a marvelous tale of love affection and great musical numbers whether or not you like musicals or not one listen to these tunes and you will be humming them all day long oliver is a triumph on and off the stage and is a timeless work of art
much about love life can be learned from watching the folks at the shop around the corner ernst lubitsch had another quiet triumph added to his credit with this lovely film with sparkling dialogue courtesy of his longtime collaborator samson raphaelson and wonderful performances from a cast of abundantly talented performers he created a truly memorable movie always believing in playing up to the intelligence of his viewers and favoring sophistication over slapstick the director concocted a scintillating cinematic repast seasoned with that elusive enigmatic quality known as the lubitsch touch although the story is set in budapest and there is a jumble of accents among the players this is of no consequence the beautiful simplicity of the plot is that any great american city or small town could easily be the locus for the action jimmy stewart margaret sullavan are wonderful as the clerks in love with romance and then with each other without knowing it their dialogue so adeptly handled as to seem utterly natural perfectly conveys their confusion quiet desperation as they seek for soul mates theirs is one of the classic love stories of the cinema cherubic frank morgan has a more serious role than usual that of a man whose transient importance in his little world is shattered when he finds himself to be a cuckold an accomplished scene stealer he allows no emotion to escape unvented additionally morgan provides the film with its most joyous few moments near the end when he determines that his store s newest employee an impoverished youth enjoys a memorable christmas eve joseph schildkraut adds another vivid depiction to his roster of screen portrayals this time that of a toadying sycophantic lothario who thoroughly deserves the punishment eventually meted out to him gentle felix bressart has his finest film role as a family man who really can not afford to become involved in shop intrigues yet remains a steadfast friend to stewart sara haden graces the small role of a sales clerk william tracy is hilarious as the ambitious errand boy who takes advantage of unforeseen developments to leverage himself onto the sales force in tiny roles charles halton plays a no nonsense detective and edwin maxwell appears as a pompous doctor movie mavens will recognize mary carr mabel colcord both uncredited in their single scene as miss sullavan s grandmother aunt
i found this movie to be suspenseful almost from the get go when miss stanwyck starts her narration it s only a few minutes until you realize that trouble is coming the deserted area the lock on the deserted gas station door everything sets you up to wait for it here it comes at first you think it will be about the little boy but all too soon you start holding your breath watching the tide coming in i found this movie to be really stressful even though i had watched it before and was prepared for the denouement now a movie that can keep you in suspense even when you have seen it before deserves some sort of special rating maybe a white knuckles award
saw this again recently on comedy central i d love to see jean schertler memama and emmy collins hippie in supermarket cast as mother and son in a film it would probably be the weirdest flicker ever made hats off to waters for making a consistently funny film
i thought that it was a great film for kids ages a little sappy but the story is uplifting an fresh it proves that the dreams of an adolescent can truly come true i think that it s a great story for any kid who is feelings down or feels as if there trying to juggle too many things among them very cute film bravo
the only thing serious about this movie is the humor well worth the rental price i ll bet you watch it twice it s obvious that sutherland enjoyed his role
so todd sheets once stated that he considers his shot on video z epic zombie bloodbath to be his first feature film anyone who s ever seen a little beauty called zombie rampage knows exactly how untrue that statement is i mean what makes this one that much more superior well then again zombie rampage doesn t include that mullet guy now does it for one to comprehend exactly why zombie bloodbath is actually considered worth a damn one must remember what the s were like for lovers of bad horror a decade that all but said goodbye to b and z cinema as we knew it technological advances awkward trends and the internet would abolish the mysterious charms of the s o v s big boxed golden years and anything remotely resembling quality schlock was all too self aware for it s own good basically defeating the purpose luckily not everyone changes with the times enter zombie bloodbath and i guess this is the part where i explain the same exact premise from other zombie flicks from the last years alright so some kind of accident at a nuclear plant infects everyone in sight turning them into flesh eating zombies who go on a rampage inflicting some of the most gruesome yet humorous gore scenes of the s the first minutes are cluttered with the most awkward sounding conversations you could imagine conversations that let you know that this isn t just a low budget zombie flick this is a z grade disasterpiece fella plenty hysterical non existent acting to go around and that goes triple for mr mullet that guy is truly the highlight of the night the fact that todd sheets seriously considers zombie bloodbath to be that superior to zombie rampage amuses me to no end i mean really both are complete jokes on celluloid but then again so is redneck zombies so obviously todd sheets is in the company of awsomeness by a movie this bad would no doubt be a full blast spoof but mr sheets stands his ground giving us some good old fashion schlock the way it was meant to be unaware clueless and pointless god bless todd sheets for anyone seeking surprisingly worthwhile s b horror leif jonker s darkness should be at the top of your list as for zombie bloodbath if you re a gorehound who got bored sometime around then would be the perfect time to pick up
road to perdition a movie undeservedly overlooked at that year oscars is the second work of sam mendes and in my opinion his best work a director who three years before won oscar for his widely acclaimed but controversial american beauty this is a terrific movie and at the same time ultimately poignant and sad it s a story of a relatively wealthy and happy family from outward appearance during difficult times of depression when the michael sullivan a father of two children played by great tom hanks i m not his admirer but ought to say that is a hit man for local mafia boss played by paul newman his eldest son a thirteen years boy michael sullivan jr perfectly played by young tyler hoechlin after years of blissful ignorance finds out what is his father job and on what money their family live prompted by his curiosity and his aspiration to know truth he accidentally becomes a witness of a murder committed by john rooney son of his father boss such discovery strikes an innocent soul and it caused numerous events that changed his life forever the atmosphere of the period all the backgrounds and decorations are perfectly created editing and cinematography are almost flawless while the story is well written but the main line of the movie the most important moments and points of the movie and the key factor of the movie success are difficult father son relations in bad times they are shown so deeply strong and believable tom hanks does excellent and has one of the best performances of his career in a quite unusual role for him and all acting across the board is superb finally worth to mention a very nice score by paul newman and in the result we get an outstanding work of all people involved in making this beautiful but one more time sad masterpiece i believe road to perdition belongs to greatest achievements of film making of this decade and undoubtedly one of the best films of the year my grade out of
i thought this movie was really really great because in india cinemas nowadays all you see is skin music and bad acting in this movie you can see some tradition ethnicity and at least some decency although some parts were a little dramatic guess what that is what indian cinema is all about after watching this movie at least you don t get a headache from all the loud overrated music or any violence its just the truth it teaches about love and of course caring for the person you love throughout life i think it was an amazing movie kids can watch it without a doubt and adults will enjoy the simplicity that used to be india s sure profoundness until all these rap hits miniskirts and skin showing became a part of it
i had the opportunity to see this film debut at the appalachian film festival in which it won an award for best picture this film is brilliantly done with an excellent cast that works well as an ensemble my favorite performances were from youssef kerkour justin lane and adam jones also there are some great effects with dragonflies and cockroaches that i was surprised to find out that this film was done on a small budget the writer director adam jones who i believe also won an award for his writing does an excellent job with direction the audience loved this movie cross eyed will keep you laughing throughout the movie definitely a must see
after chicago i was beginning to lose all respect for richard gere and then along came the flock there s just so far a nice smile and a couple of stock facial gestures can get you but he proved to me that he s finally gotten hold of his craft and can act with the best of them clare danes was also super as his trainee replacement some have suggested there was too much unnecessary violence but i don t see it that way nothing i saw detracted from the power of this film i was really shocked i hadn t heard of it being released in theaters and came across it at blockbuster instead really an exceptional film with just the right blend of action suspense thrills and social consciousness as good as even well maybe and you ll see better acting out of gere than anyone s ever gotten out of pitt
ko to tamo peva is one of the best films i ever saw a tragicomedy with very deep implications on the fate of humankind shown through the eyes of seemingly very plain and common people from a god forsaken serbian province just before the start of the world war ii i saw it in a small movie theater in russia where the film had had a very limited distribution and i had no chance to come across it ever since it is such a pity that this excellent film is almost forgotten now i searched for a vhs or dvd copy of it many times and alas could find none i would be most grateful to other fans of this little gem of movie making for a suggestion of the ways to purchase a copy
many reviews here explain the story and characters of opening night in some detail so i won t do that i just want to add my comment that i believe the film is a wonderful affirmation of life at the beginning myrtle gordon is remembering how easy it was to act when she was when she had youth and energy and felt she knew the truth experience has left her emotionally fragile wondering what her life has been for and indeed if she can even continue living a tragic accident triggers a personal crisis that almost overwhelms her almost but not quite at the eleventh hour she rediscovers the power of her art and reasserts herself i m going to bury that bastard she says of fellow actor maurice as she goes on stage it seems almost sadistic when myrtle s director prevents people from helping her when she arrives hopelessly drunk for her first performance he knows however that she has to have the guts to make it herself if she is to make it at all some critics wonder if this triumph is just a temporary pause on myrtle s downward path i believe this is truly her opening night she opens like a flower to new possibilities of life and action she sees a way forward it is tremendously moving gena rowlands is superb the film is superb thank you mr cassavetes wherever you are
the movie is about anton newcombe the music and careers of the two bands are simply backdrop it s only fair that newcombe have the last word about the film which at this writing you can find in the news section at the brianjonestownmassacre website i d link it here but imdb won t permit it documentarians are limited by what the camera captures as well as by the need to assemble a cohesive narrative from the somewhat random occasions when chance has put the camera lens on a sight line with relevant happenstance in dig fortune smiled on the dandy warhols capturing their rise to the status of pop idol candidates as they formed slickly produced pop confections for mass consumption most notably bohemian like you a song that made them global darlings thanks to a euro cell phone ad no such luck for brian jonestown massacre the film captures little of what made the original bjm lineup great with the sole exception of a single montage lasting a minute or so showing newcombe creating recording a number of brief instrumental parts unremarkable in themselves and concluding the sequence with a playback of the lush shimmering sounds that had to have been in newcombe s mind and soul before they could enter the world three commentaries accompany the film one by the filmmakers and two by the members of the bands the bjm track is solely former members and without newcombe both the warhols and bjm alumni point up this montage sequence as the best bit in the film and i d agree that given the film s focus on anton newcombe it is the only part of the film that sheds proper light on his gift and seems too brief to lend proper balance to this attempted portrait of the tortured artist interesting thing about commentaries is that unlike film they are recorded in real time one long take which can be more honestly revelatory than a documentary that takes shape primarily through editing the dandies do not come off well in their comments if the rock and roll world extends the experience of high school life for its denizens as i believe it does the dandies are the popularity obsessed preppy types the ones who listen to rock because it s what their peers do while the bjm crew come off as the half rejected half self exiled outsiders to insiders like the dandies losers that are the real rock spirit bjm s joel gion who talks a lot nails the film s message for me when he says paraphrasing you can t forget that anton has been able to do the only thing he ever said he wanted to do make a lot of great music the dandies meanwhile laugh too easily at every outrageous display in the course of newcombe s meltdown all the bjm footage here ends at before newcombe quit heroin courtney taylor taylor s discounting of newcombe s commitment to his vision is summed up as follows he s and still living in his car you can download all his work at his website he was so tired of being ripped off by everyone else he s giving it all away he could be making a mint you can practically hear him shaking his head in disbelief the film s shortcomings can t be blamed on the filmmakers rather it s the difficulties of the documentary form and the loss of cooperation by the film s subject that makes this portrait of newcombe so fragmentary but it s likely the best we will get outside of his music i only rented disc one which has the feature most of the extras are on disc two not renting that as i ve put in my order to buy the set
david lynch s new short is a very lynchian piece full of darkness tension silences discreet but very textured background music and features again two beautiful actresses a blonde and a brunette a recurrent theme in his work both characters create a very intriguing slave mistress relationship that could be seen as a direct follow up to the same kind of relationship featured in mulholland dr beautiful for lynch fan s
i ve been impressed with chavez s stance against globalisation for sometime now but it wasn t until i saw the film at the amsterdam documentary international film festival that i realize what he has really achieved this film tells the story of coup conspiracy by venezuela s elite the oil companies and oil loving corrupt western governments to remove democratically elected president chavez and return venezuela back to a brutal dictatorship this film is must for anyone who believes in freedom and justice and is also a lesson to the rest of world i commend the people of venezuela for taking matter into their own hands and saving their country from the likes of halliburton and the bush regime
i wasn t expecting the highest calibre of film making with joel schumacher directing this one so i was surprised that tigerland wasn t a complete waste of time in technique it s often derivative of saving private ryan with the shaky camera work grainy shots the film occasionally running like it s skipping a sprocket all those techniques speilberg used to make his film seem more realistic but in the end was more distracting than anything else but unlike saving private ryan the emotional component wasn t as weak as the characters in this film seemed more like real people and the story less contrived not so wrapped up in the american flag speilberg gets an f in subtlety next to the first section of kubrick s full metal jacket this is the most realistic portrayal of boot camp that i have seen in a film and for that i think it s worth watching it s not a great film but neither is it a bad film
okay i saw this movie as a child and really loved it my parents never purchased the movie for me but i think i ll go about and buy it now i m a sucker for pre animated films anyway onto the actual review what i liked there was an actual portrayal of heaven and hell one of the few i ve seen in animated films character development existed it s easy to classify characters in this movie i e charlie is the selfish mutt itchy is cynical but believes charlie carface is obviously the relentless villain etc i also loved king gator s song i ve always loved loud annoying flamboyant guys this song may have been random but it was so fun finally the detail of the animation was beautiful you could tell charlie was all gruff and stuff and the backgrounds were beautiful what i did not like the actual portrayal of heaven the way charlie reacted to it no surprises whatsoever made it actually seem very boring he denied a place in heaven and still got to return to it in the end i remember a few lines of certain songs such as you can t keep a good dog down let s make music forever and welcome to being dead but i can t remember the majority of any of them the songs weren t that catchy to be honest whippet angel she s annoying and that neck augh what parents may not like a few very scary depending on the viewer images of hell are shown during the movie carface is quite threatening beer is also implied but not actually dubbed beer gambling is a key element in the movie the good guy dies overall i love this movie even if it is a bit forgettable at times the scarier children s animations are always my favorite ones this was created back in a time when producers and writers weren t afraid to give kids a little scare now and then nowadays this probably would have been rated pg kids under the age of or easily disturbed kids should not watch this other than that i give it happy viewing
i saw brother s shadow at the tribeca film festival and found myself still thinking about it two days later the story of a prodigal son scott cohen returning to his family s custom furniture business after a stint in jail it offers all the necessary qualities of a solid drama memorable characters sharp observant dialog sensitive use of the camera by a filmmaker who thinks visually but more than that it presents something that is all too rare at the multiplex these days the uncompromising vision of a mature sensibility the talent of director screenwriter todd s yellin seems to emerge full blown but we get the sense he like his protagonist has paid his dues he knows how real people struggle in this world and he knows how we yearn to see or at least to experience vicariously success yet yellin respects his audience too much to blow happy smoke up our rear ends in the end we see that jake s triumph doesn t lie in commissions or even in the esteem of his family but in the work he couldn t abandon if he tried it s an essential theme in a world and especially a movie industry that can t rise above the bottom line this film deserves a wide audience
mitchell leisen s fifth feature as director and he shows his versatility by directing a musical after his previous movies were heavy dramas he also plays a cameo as the conductor you can tell it is a pre code movie and nothing like it was made in the us for quite a while afterwards like years leisen shot the musical numbers so they were like what the audience would see no widescreen shots or from above ala busby berkeley what i do find funny or interesting is that you never actually see the audience as others have mentioned the leads are fairly characterless and jack oakie and victor mclaghlan play their normal movie personas gertrude michael however provides a bit of spark the musical numbers are interesting and some good the rape of the rhapsody in particular is amusing but the drama unconvincing and faked three murders is too many and have minimal emotional impact on the characters this is where this movie could have been a lot better
for me too this christmas special is one that i remember very fondly in i snatched up the cds i found of the soundtrack recording giving one to my sister and keeping the other for myself it s part of my family s christmas tradition now and i would love to be able to actually see the show again rather than just remember it as i listen it has been noted elsewhere that john denver made a number of appearances on the muppet show and they did more than one special together the good rapport between denver and his fuzzy companions comes through clearly here in a charming and fun show that is good for all ages
as much as i like big epic pictures i ll spare you the namedropping it s great to kick back with a few beers and a simple action flick sometimes films where the plot takes a backseat to the set pieces films where the dialogue isn t so cleverly written that it ties itself in endless knots of purple prose there are hundreds of films that fit the bill but in my opinion gone in sixty seconds is one of the better ones it s an update of the movie that shares its name it also shares that picture s ethos but not quite it s execution whatever was great about the original has been streamlined whatever was streamlined was also amped up thanks to a bigger budget often these kinds of endeavours are recipes for complete disaster see the pug ugly remake of the italian job for one that blew it but here thanks to a cast of mostly excellent actors sixty succeeds the plot and much of the dialogue isn t much to write imdb about often you ll have scenes where the same line of dialogue goes back and forth between the actors each of whom will voice it with different inflections a lot of people found this annoying i find it raises a smile each actor gets a chance to show off his or her definition of style here with cage jolie and duvall leading the pack of course and it should be noted that it s also amusing to see mrs pitt not given first billing here the chemistry between good ol saint nick the stalwart see date of review and angelina leads to a couple of nice moments the villain is not even a little scary i ve seen chris eccleston play tough guy roles before so i know he can handle them but i think he was deliberately directed to make his role inconsequential as not to distract from the action we know the heroes are going to succeed somehow we re just sitting in the car with them enjoying the ride i think a lot of these scenes were played with tongue so far in cheek that it went over the heads of a lot of people giving this a poor rating in fact i wouldn t have minded some fourth wall breaking winks at the camera it s just that kind of movie all this style and not so much substance something that often exhausts my patience if not executed just so would be worthless if the action wasn t there and for the most part it is wonderfully so i ve noticed that it seems to be a common trend to be using fast cut extreme close up shots to direct action these days i personally find this kind of thing exhausting i prefer movies like this where the stunts are impressive enough to not need artificial tension ramping by raping tight shots all the time i ve been told that cage actually did as many of the car stunts as he could get away with without losing his insurance in real life i mean his character clearly doesn t care and it shows the man can really move a vehicle and this is put to good use in the slow burning climatic finale where he drives a mustang into the ground in the most outlandish and fun way possible so yes this movie isn t an epic life affirming post picture with obligatory social commentary effort the pacing is uneven some of the scenes could have been cut and not all the actors tow the line but car movies rarely come better than this so if you hate cars why are you even reading these comments i d take it over the numerous iterations of the flaccid and the tedious guess the franchise any day
i come to pinjar from a completely different background than most of the other reviewers who have posted here i m relatively new to bollywood films and was born and raised in the us so i don t have a broad basis for comparing pinjar to other indian films luckily no comparison is needed pinjar stands on its own as nothing less than a masterpiece in one line i can tell you that pinjar is one of the most important films to come out of any studio anywhere at any time on a mass appeal scale it could have been the indian equivalent of crouching tiger hidden dragon had it been adequately promoted in the us this could very well have been the film that put bollywood on the american map the american movie going public has a long standing love affair with gone with the wind and while pinjar doesn t borrow from that plot there are some passing similarities not the least of which is the whopping by us standards minute run time set against the gritty backdrop of the india pakistan partition in is a compelling human drama of a young woman imprisoned by circumstances and thrust into troubles she had no hand in creating put into an untenable position she somehow manages to not only survive but to grow and even flourish if the story is lacking in any way it s in the exposition puro s the protagonist growth as a person would be better illustrated at least for western audiences unfamiliar with indian culture if her character s back story were more fully developed in the early part of the film but that would have stretched a hour movie to hours or perhaps even more because not one minute of the film is wasted and none of what made it out of editing could really be cut for the sake of time better that the audience has to fill in some of what came before than to leave out any of what remains i could use many words to describe pinjar poignant disturbing compelling heart wrenching come to mind immediately but uplifting is perhaps as apropos as any of those any story that points up the indomitability of the human spirit against the worst of odds has to be considered such and puro s triumph while possibly not immediately evident to those around her is no less than inspirational for strength of story alone i cannot recommend this film highly enough equally inspiring is urmila matondkar s portrayal of puro all too often overlooked amid the bevy of younger newer actresses urmila has the unique capability to deliver a completely credible character in any role she plays she doesn t merely act puro s part she breathes life into the character manoj bajpai s selection as rashid was inspired he manages something far too few indian film heroes can subtlety his command of expression and nuance is essential to the role he brings more menace to the early part of the film with his piercing stare than all of the sword wielding rioters combined if you only see one bollywood film in your life make it pinjar
a kind of road movie in old fashioned trains in the slowenian late summer province at the beginning you see someone in underwear sewing trousers from black cloth and when the same young man in his black trousers leaves the house with two suitcases you see that the trousers part is missing on a flag of mourning appearently his father has died in the train he meets a young lady and almost without words but many small gestures a wonderful love story begins it s a somehow surreal very poetic and a little bizarre movie with a lot of strange characters and strange incidents beautiful pictures with love for beautiful details
in panic in the streets richard widmark plays u s navy doctor who has his week rudely interrupted with a corpse that contains plague as cop paul douglas properly points out the guy died from two bullets in the chest that s not the issue here the two of them become unwilling partners in an effort to find the killers and anyone else exposed to the disease as was pointed out by any number of people for some reason director elia kazan did not bother to cast the small parts with anyone that sounds like they re from louisiana having been to new orleans where the story takes place i can personally attest to that richard widmark and his wife barbara bel geddes can be excused because as a navy doctor he could be assigned there but for those that are natives it doesn t work but with plague out there and the news being kept a secret the new orleans pd starts a dragnet of the city s underworld the dead guy came off a ship from europe and he had underworld connections a new orleans wise guy played by jack palance jumps to a whole bunch of erroneous conclusions and starts harassing a cousin of the dead guy who is starting to show plague symptoms palance got rave reviews in the first film where he received notice personally my favorite in this film is zero mostel this happened right before mostel was blacklisted and around that time he made a specialty of playing would be tough guys who are really toadies he plays the same kind of role in the humphrey bogart film the enforcer sadly i can kind of identify with mostel in that last chase scene where he and palance are being chased down by widmark douglas and half the new orleans police seeing the weight challenged zero trying to keep up with palance was something else because i m kind of in zero s league now in the heft department kazan kept the action going at a good clip there s very little down time in this film if there was any less it would be an indiana jones film panic in the streets won an oscar for best original screenplay that year kazan also made good use of the new orleans waterfront and the french quarter some of the same kinds of shots are later used in on the waterfront in fact panic in the streets is about people not squealing when they really should in their own best interest very similar again to on the waterfront panic in the streets does everyone proud who was associated with it now why couldn t elia kazan get some decent new orleans sounding people in the small roles
this is not as bad a movie as some reviewers and as the summary at the imdb page for this movie say it is why first is the fact that in the movie makers were daring enough to confront as one of the plot elements the issue of domestic violence so reviewers who complain about the plot are sadly missing one of the main points second without the plot element of prince s movie relationship with his abusive father the musical climax wouldn t work as well as it does so those reviewers who say that only the music is good have once again missed one of the points specifically why it is so good because all of the music in this film has a plot element backdrop that makes the music more effective third give this movie a break for first time movie producers and director this is just not that bad there are far worse movies out there by accomplished movie people and last the reviewers who say that the music is good have also missed the point check out the range of stylistic musical treatments the variety the musicianship and the stage performance of prince truly one of a kind going musically where no one else was going during the s and with a style seen in the work of other artists clothes and movement which costuming elements came first michael jackson s or prince s also see if you can spot the splayed fingers sweeping in front of the eyes that prince does in this movie long before quentin tarentino s pulp fiction as the sum of its parts not a bad movie at all
i happened to borrow this movie from a friend knowing nothing about it and it turned out to be an outstanding documentary about a journey on an ancient vessel across vast expanses of the ocean thor heyerdahl had developed a theory that the ancient incas in peru managed to travel thousands of miles across the ocean to polynesia based on certain relics that are found in both places certain types of ancient sea going vessels that we know they had available analysis of ocean and wind currents and the knowledge that the incas did in fact travel in some undetermined amount at sea in order to test his hypothesis heyerdahl and his crew construct a vessel as closely as possible to what the ancient incas had available using only balsa wood and other materials available at the time and set out from lima peru s capital to try to reach the islands of polynesia some miles away his theory like so much about ancient history is impossible to prove with certainty but the coverage of their journey provides for strong support that he is right the film is really little more than narration of footage taken during the day expedition but it is a very detailed description of what it was like and the trials and tribulations that they faced i often wish that academy award winning documentaries were easier to find and this one from more than years ago is still as interesting and informative as i am sure it was when it was first released
i was watching this movie on friday apr th i didn t see the last scene cos i was talking with my bro n mom in law at the same time anyone can tell me what happened to her i watched slightly that her husband was hearing someone was talking to his wife in the bedroom and then he opened the door she s dead already what happened to her did she kill herself how could she arrange everything like the phone calls meanwhile she s at home when her husband was talking to this strange admirer anyone can explain to me please i am so so curious in the end i read that she suffered from multiply disorder personality thnks before
i wasn t alive in the s so i can t guarantee that this movie was a completely accurate representation of the period but it is certainly a moving and fulfilling experience there are some excellent performances most notably by josh hamilton of with honors jerry o connell sliders who play brothers divided by the war bill smitrovich a character actor who has been long ignored by many gives a heart filled performance as their strict father who is forced to question his own beliefs and values as one of his sons makes him proud by going to vietnam but returns empty inside while the other is exactly the opposite all in all this is a powerful and heartwarming film that i hope everyone gets a chance to experience
this short film that inspired the soon to be full length feature spatula madness is a hilarious piece that contends against similar cartoons yielding multiple writers the short film stars edward the spatula who after being fired from his job joins in the fight against the evil spoons this premise allows for some funny content near the beginning but is barely present for the remainder of the feature this film s minute running time is absorbed by some odd ball comedy and a small musical number unfortunately not much else lies below it the plot that is set up doesn t really have time to show but it s surely follows it plot better than many high budget hollywood films this film is worth watching at least a few times take it for what it is and don t expect a deep story
jim carrey can do anything i thought this was going to be some dumb childish movie and it totally was not it was so incredibly funny for everyone adults kids i saw it once cause it was almost out of theatres and now it s finally coming out on dvd this tuesday and i m way to excited as you can see you should definitely see it if you haven t already it was so great liz
a very funny east meets west film influenced by the closure of gm s flint michigan plant in the eighties and the rise and integration of japanese automakers in the us set in western pennsylvania it features great performances by michael keaton gedde watanabe and george wendt music by blues legend stevie ray vaughan
this film like astaire s royal wedding which was shown after it on turner classic network last night is famous for a single musical sequence that has gained a place in gene kelly s record like fred astaire dancing with a clothing rack and later dancing around a room s walls and ceiling this film had gene kelly dancing in a cartoon sequence with jerry mouse the sequence is nicely done what is forgotten is that kelly is telling the story behind the cartoon sequence to dean stockwell and his fellow child students at school during a break in the day and sets the stage for the sequence by having stockwell and the others shut their eyes and imagine a pastoral type of background kelly even changes the navy blues he actually wears into a white pomeranian navy uniform with blue stripes on it jerry mouse does more than dance with gene he actually talks a first that he did not repeat for many decades he also finally puts tom cat into his proper place tom briefly appears as king jerry s butler trying to cheer him with a platter of cheeses but the sequence of the cartoon with kelly took about seven minutes of the movie far more of this peculiar film is taken up with kelly s story of the lost four day furlough in hollywood and how kelly ends up meeting katherine grayson and with frank sinatra stalking jose iturbi at the mgm film studio the hollywood bowl and iturbi s own home except that the two sailors mean no harm this film could have been quite disturbing kelly has saved sinatra s life in the pacific and is getting a medal as a result they are both among the crewmen back in california who are getting a four day leave but the script writers to propel what would be a short film kelly has plans to spend four days having sex with one lola an unseen good time girl in hollywood saddle gene with frank it seems frank is one of those idiots that appear in film after film of the movie factories particularly musical comedies who are socially underdeveloped and in need of instruction about meeting girls or guys if the characters are women frank insists that gene help teach him how to get a girl just then a policeman takes them to headquarters to help the cops with a little boy stockwell who insists on joining the navy and won t give the cops his real name and address when a protesting kelly is able to get this information out of stockwell by asking him some straight questions which the cops could not ask they insist kelly take the boy home to his aunt grayson still protesting kelly gets saddled with increasingly complicated problems mostly due to sinatra s simplistic soul view of things he misses seeing lola the next day by sleeping late sinatra felt he looked so peaceful sleeping he did not wake him up he keeps getting dragged back to grayson s house as sinatra feels she is the right woman for himself but needs kelly to train him in love making i suppose my presentation of the plot may annoy fans of anchors aweigh but i find this kind of story irritating while the singing and dancing and concert music of kelly sinatra grayson and iturbi are first rate it is annoying to have to take the idiocies of someone like sinatra s character seriously in the real world kelly would have beaten the hell out of him at the start for following him at the beginning of the four day furlough what right has he to insist as sinatra does that someone who saves their life should assist him on learning how to date that kind of crap always ruins the total affects of a musical for me unless the musical numbers are so superior as to make me forget this type of nonsense the stalking of iturbi is likewise annoying kelly tries to get grayson to like sinatra when he says sinatra can get her a meeting with jose iturbi to audition her singing ability for much of the rest of the picture sinatra and kelly try to do that and keep floundering at one point for no really good reason grayson herself ruins kelly s attempt to get an interview at mgm with iturbi it is only sheer luck that iturbi feels sorry for an embarrassed grayson that she does give him an audition of her talent kelly by the way ends up with grayson sinatra s conscience at not being able to help her see iturbi makes him ashamed of his bothering her but not pulling kelly into it oddly enough and he meanwhile accidentally stumbles into meeting a waitress pamela britton from his native brooklyn and naturally without any assistance from kelly sinatra and britton fall in love ah consistency thy name is not screenwriting necessarily
i really liked this film one of those rare films that hollywood really does not make anymore william h macy is just great as the hit man with a soul and neve campbell is just flat out fantastic as the woman who puts his life on the track of redemption if you have a chance see this film it earns it s praise
i have just started watching the tv series what i like about you and i must say that is a joy to watch i always like to see new shows do well considering a lot of shows go off before you really get a feel for them i have watched amanda bynes since all that she is truly a funny girl what is the best about her comedy is that its so natural and what i mean about that is its something that a person could here there best friend saying its not rehearsed i just recently started watching the show and have fell in love i am just watching re runs as of now but am looking forward to the next season all the characters in the show give something to the whole story line its nice to see some old face from other shows i enjoyed watching in the past such as jennie garth from leslie grossman from popular and wesley jonathan from city guys the new character are very talented as well nick zano has that charm the makes you love him even when he is doing something wrong to holly bynes overall this show has the right ingredients to be successful i look forward to watching it grow
this movie is amazing for several reasons harris takes an extremely awkward documentary and turns it into a relevant social commentary groovin gary is a small town kid who is assumed well liked for his many impersonations when he decides to play olivia newton john in a local talent show for whom he is very passionate gary s actions show that he is at odds with the conservative social environment in which he lives this results in him making various justifications for his actions so that people will not think that he is in fact a transvestite or other such social outcast in the second installment harris exploites the struggle between gary and beaver in a novice attempt to make a narrative out of the original documentary the third and final installment to the trilogy is truly amazing for harris extreme sensitivity with the subject unlike the second installment the orkly kid shows gary as a truly troubled character he struggles to gain acceptance within his own community to no avail his secret passion for dressing like olivia newton john distances him even further from the people that already consider him a social outcast the movie is depicted so realistically that like reality it lends itself to many reactions surely one can see gary as a ridiculously pathetic character but may also identify with him as an outcast
in the funeral of the famous british journalist joe strombel ian mcshane his colleagues and friends recall how obstinate he was while seeking for a scoop meanwhile the deceased joe discloses the identity of the tarot card serial killer of london he cheats the reaper and appears to the american student of journalism sondra pransky scarlett johansson who is on the stage in the middle of a magic show of the magician sidney waterman woody allen in london and tells her that the murderer is the aristocrat peter lyman hugh jackman sondra drags sid in her investigation seeking for evidences that peter is the killer however she falls in love with him and questions if joe strombel is right in his scoop scoop is another great woody allen s comedy outside manhattan actually again in london his ironic and witty lines are simply fantastic and i laughed a lot inclusive with his fate of hero in a country where people drive in the wrong side sid waterman is extremely funny and woody allen is in an excellent shape as comedian however his present muse scarlett johansson of whom i am a big fan has over acting and is annoying in many moments changing inclusive her accent to a histrionic pronunciation her character is absolutely silly and promiscuous and i was quite disappointed with her performance probably for the first time in her filmography but this supernatural comedy is still a hilarious and worthwhile entertainment my vote is eight title brazil scoop o grande furo scoop the big scoop
hollywood hotel is a fast moving exuberant wonderfully entertaining musical comedy from warners which is sadly overlooked it should be remembered if only for providing the official theme song of tinseltown hooray for hollywood the score by richard whiting and johnny mercer has a number of other gems however including the charming i m like a fish out of water and silhouetted in the moonlight the best musical number is let that be a lesson to you in which dick powell and company detail the misadventures of people who found themselves behind the eight ball a fate which literally befalls slow burning edgar kennedy at the number s end the picture celebrates hollywood glamour and punctures it all at once as it gets a lot of comic mileage out of pompous and ego maniacal actors and duplicitous studio executives the cast includes a gaggle of great character comedians allyn joslyn as a crafty press agent ted healy as dick powell s would be manager fritz feld as an excitable restaurant patron glenda farrell as mona marshall s sarcastic gal friday edgar kennedy as a put upon drive in manager mabel todd as mona s goofy sister and hugh herbert as her even goofier dad the racist element mentioned in another review here is a ten second bit where herbert appears in black face during a pseudo gone with the wind sequence it s in questionable taste but it shouldn t prevent you from seeing the other delights in this film notably the benny goodman quartet including teddy wilson and lionel hampton in what i believe is the only footage available on this incredible jazz combo the dark eyes sequence goes on a bit too long and comes in too late but otherwise hollywood hotel is a gem well worth your time and certainly a film which should be considered for dvd release
as a habit i always like to read through the hated it reviews of any given movie especially one that i d want to comment on and it s not so much a point counterpoint sorta deal i just like to see what people say on the flipside however i do want to address one thing many people that hated it called it to paraphrase beautiful but shallow some even going so far as to say that norm s desire yet inability to help his brother was a mundane plot at best i d like to disagree as a brother of a sibling who has a similar dysfunction i can relate daily you see them abuse themselves knowing only that their current path will inevitably lead them to self destruction and it s not about the specifics of what they did when how or why paul decided to take up gambling and associating with questionable folks it s really more how they are wired on one hand they are veritable geniuses and on the other painfully self destructive it s a lot like people like howard hughes the same forces which drive them are the same forces which tear them apart and all the while you see this you know this and what s worse you realize you can t do a damn thing about it for norman maclean a river runs through it was probably a way to find an answer to why the tragedy had to occur and who was to blame in the end no one is and often there is no why but it takes a great deal of personal anguish to truly come to this realization sometimes it takes a lifetime and sometimes it never comes at all
this is an excellent little film about the loneliness of the single man phillipe harel as notre heros is a bit like an amalgam of robert de niro in taxi driver inspector clouseau in his stoicism and chauncey gardiner in being there also peter sellers he is single yet doesn t have a clue how to attract the opposite sex in fact he really makes no effort at all he has a stoicism and fatalism that defies any hope of ever achieving coupledom his friend jose garcia as tisserand is in the same plight yet at least makes a brave effort to transcend his extended virginhood he s and admits he s never had sex very good outdoor shots of paris and rouen where the two software people travel on business they try various nightclubs and places but all to no avail my theory is that they re trying the wrong places they go to more or less youth nightclubs they should try the type that has older people more their own age harel increasingly becomes isolated and does a little de niro effort as in taxi driver urging his friend colleague to go and stab some bloke who s pulled a nice looking girl in the nightclub worth watching
this film is pure elvira and shows her at her breast i mean best the story co written by cassandra peterson elvira s alter ego is inspiring and captivating and is brought to life by elvira s wit and charm the viewer gets an opportunity to see elvira in a whole new light as she struggles with the prejudices of the people of fallwell massachusetts where she has travelled from los angeles in order to attend the reading of her great aunt morganna s will and at the same time tries to help the long suffering teenagers who have been deprived of fun by the matriarchal chastity pariah and the rest of the town council she also has to deal with her attraction to bob redding the owner of the local cinema and another woman patty who has her eye on bob as well but is not nearly as deserving of his love as elvira and later in the movie she also faces the complications of being descended from a major metaphysical celebrity and the charges of witchcraft brought against her which mean that she will be burnt at the stake elvira manages to be both sexy and vulnerable streetwise and naive in this film while cracking risque jokes and delivering off beat lines with double meanings this movie is inspiring because it gives out the message of never giving up on yourself and always trying to follow your dreams in the end elvira s dreams finally come true which is the best thing that could happen to this wonderfully unique and determined woman i ve seen this movie countless times and i never ever get tired of it there are no unnecessary scenes and i found myself captivated throughout the whole movie a review will not do justice to the actual movie so i can just tell you to please watch it because it is one of the best movies ever made meanwhile i wish you unpleasant dreams
although the story is fictional it draws from the reality of not only the history of latin american countries but all the third world this is the true pure and raw recent history of these countries summarized concisely in this novel film the offbeat supranatural stuff lightens up the intensity of historical events presented in this movie after all the supranatural stuff is a part of the culture in the third world although is not critically acclaimed probably because of the supranatural stuff this is an excellent movie with a great story and great acting
there can be no denying that hak se wui election in english is a well made and well thought out film the film uses numerous clever pieces of identification all the time playing with modernity yet sticking to tradition a theme played with throughout the film where john woo s hong kong films are action packed and over the top in their explosive content as seen in hard boiled and when hong kong films do settle down into rhythms of telling the story from the bad point of view they can sometimes stutter and just become merely unmemorable a good example being city on fire election is a film that is memorable for the sheer fact of its unpredictable scenes spontaneous action and violence that are done in a realistic and tasteful if that s the right word manner as well as the clever little in pieces of film making it s difficult to spot during the viewing but election is really constructed in a kind of three act structure there is the first point of concern involving the actual election and whoever is voted in is voted in not everyone likes the decision but what the uncles say goes the second act is the retrieving of the ancient baton from china that tradition demands must be present during the inauguration with the final third the aftermath of the inauguration and certain characters coming up with their own ideas on how the triads should and could be run needless to say certain events and twists occur during each of the three thirds some are small and immaterial whereas some are much larger and spectacular election does have some faults with the majority coming in the opening third trying to kill off time surrounding an election that only takes a few minutes to complete was clearly a hard task for the writers and filmmakers and that shows at numerous points i got the feeling that a certain scene was just starting to go somewhere before it was interrupted by the police and then everyone gets arrested this happens a few times a fight breaks out in a restaurant but the police are there and everyone is arrested there s a secret meeting about the baton between the triads but the police show up and everyone gets arrested some other triads are having a pre election talk but the police show up and guess what you know once the film gets out of that rut that i thought it would it uses a sacred baton as a plot device to get everybody moving the baton spawns some good fight scenes such as the chasing of a truck after it s been hotwired another chase involving a motorbike and a kung fu fight with a load of melee weapons in a street the scenes are unpredictable realistic and violent but like i said they are in a tasteful manner where election really soars is its attention to that fine detail when the triads are in jail the bars are covered with wire suggesting they re all animals in cages as that s how they behave on the outside when in conflict another fine piece of attention to detail is the way the uncles toast using tea and not alcohol elevating themselves above other head gangsters who d use champagne the long good friday and also referencing chinese tradition of drinking tea to celebrate or commemorate election is a good film that is structured well enough to enjoy and a film that has fantastic mise en scene as you look at what s going on some of the indoor settings and the clothing as well as the buckets of style that is poured on as the search and chase for the baton intensifies the inauguration is like another short film entirely and very well integrated into the film hinting at chinese tradition in the process i feel the best scene is the ending scene as it sums it up perfectly two shifty characters fishing and debating the ruling of the triads all the while remaining realistic unpredictable and violent in a tasteful manner of course
what s inexplicable firstly the hatred towards this movie it may not be the greatest movie of all time but gimme a break it got oscars for a reason it made eighteen hundred million dollars for a reason it s a damn good movie which brings to the other inexplicable aspect of it i have no idea whatsoever why this movie left such an impression on me when i saw it in theaters i ve rewatched it on tv and video and it had none of the impact it had when i saw it on the big screen twice or maybe three times actually but that might be it the appeal of it it s a movie yes capital m there it s an epic it s a spectacle in the order of gone with the wind or ben hur now ben hur and gone with the wind seem kinda hokey to me with the hammy acting and excessive melodrama not that titanic has none of that well the acting was actually very good the melodrama was quite heavy handed at times but the reason titanic works is that it s such an emotional ride i usually enjoy movies that stimulate the mind or give me a visual thrill this movie isn t exactly dumb but it s not cerebral at all the visual thrills are simply means to an end to fuel the emotions of the audience i didn t cry when bambi s mom died i don t react to tearjerkers but this is a tearjerker to the power of ten million an emotional rollercoaster that if it were a regular one would make buzz aldrin scream like a little girl and i m sure that if you see it on video and have decided that you hate it and have a ready supply of cynicism then you can thoroughly dislike this movie but if you let that disbelief suspend just a bit if you give this epic melodrama the benefit of the doubt you ll enjoy it completely and look at the top ten grossing films of all time is a single one of them bad is a single one of them worth a score of out of no not even the phantom menace and this movie made billion dollars worldwide it can t be bad not possible p s how can anyone even consider comparing this to spiderman spiderman was a fun movie but it was a total kneejerk that caused it to gross as much as it did it simply wasn t anything all that special no one will remember it in years but i m pretty sure titanic will be remembered
well i had seen they all laughed when it came out ineurope around and had kept a vague but dear souvenir of it i ve just seen it again on tape almost twenty years after bogdanovich has a true heartfelt tenderness over his characters and a kind sympathy which is difficult not to feel also excellent comedians and actors good lines all over and for everyone and pretty good editing too i laughed and smiled all the time just as we all do at times go get it
this movie took me by complete surprise i watched it or times i really liked this film there were many truths this movie brought up i love all the characters in this film as well this movie makes a lot of sense because as society becomes more advance what does the culture loose not to sound preachy i can really relate to this movie from my child hood and loosing apart of my life that will never come back or ever been the same this film is on my top movies i have ever watched there is just such a raw truth that i feel when i watch the movie and its not the kind of truth that you have to dig for its right in front of your face the creators of this film did a great job and i enjoyed this movie very much this movie may not be for every one but if you have an open mind i think you will love it
so so thriller starring brad pitt and juliette lewis who join david duchovny and michelle forbes on a road trip out west the latter couple are researching notorious murder sites for an upcoming book pitt s a serial killer on the lam unbeknownst to dave and juliette is his poor not all there companion this is a good cast and the story moves along but pitt isn t belivably scary as a serial killer although it is one of his better earlier roles the best thing is here is michelle forbes who always manages to shine whether in her roles on homicide life on the street or in the brief series wonderland vote
okay we ve got extreme verhoeven violence although not as extreme as other verhoeven flicks we ve got plenty of sex and nudity but something is missing oh yes it s missing the intelligence that paul verhoeven is known for in his sci fi movies i admire the way verhoeven introduces the characters and how they have a sense of humor but unlike most verhoeven films the movie itself doesn t have enough humor for it to fall into the comedy genre the acting overall was above average compared to most slasher films what makes hollow man a good movie is not the story not the cast or characters but the amazing special effects work that would otherwise make a film like this impossible the crew has truly made an invisible man without the use of things like a floating hat suspended on piano wires and other practical effects effects done on set the most stunning effects scenes are not seen while kevin bacon is invisible they are when kevin bacon is becoming invisible and visible the problem is that this invisible man story deserves to be more imaginitive here it takes place at a lab for the most part i would have enjoyed seeing the invisible kevin bacon robbing a bank and getting away with it or let s say steal something from people s purses or something like that but what is shown is decent enough to make hollow man an entertaining movie grade b
a masterpiece to be recorded in the books and never forgotten a classic in time simply a must see a solid worth while very entertaining piece a good movie but there are some uneven elements or noticeable flaws may still be considered good in areas but this work has either serious issues or is restrained by inevitable elements deemed inescapable e g genre mostly a heap of nothing sparked by mildly worthwhile momentsbomb not of a viewable quality kalifornia unrated for strong violent material considerable sexuality and language i rented this film expecting an in your face summer blockbuster quality celebration of brad pitt s face but was happily surprised and disappointed this really is more of a drama and very grim at that i remember some emotionally intense duchovny voice overs pitt plays out his possibly un sexiest film ever with startling talent who started out as a hopeless yet harmless white trash husband became realized as a violent disturbing alcoholic with a messed mind during some of the latter stages in the film i found it hard to keep watching him he was unpredictable and scary this proves very good writing and acting the whole movie is filled with bizarre sensational scenes that made me hold my breath not fewer than once and i don t mean action scenes i mean dialogue scenes so brilliantly crafted i actually winced and gasped at what i was seeing it was like watching a rhino and a lion put in a cage and watching as they gnawed each other to death again i am very impressed with the screenwriter s whoever they are did the impossible mixed oil and water i also very much enjoyed juliette lewis s performance it is so rare for this talented young actress to make an appearance these days that when she does it is such a joy some of her moments in this film brought me to tears i mean that the emotions this girl can arouse in your head are incredible and i clearly remember getting blurry eyed on a few occasions i almost feel like i m cheating the quality craftsmanship the film makers have displayed by only giving kalifornia a rating but the dark feelings that it stirs are too potent and depressing to raise it i do believe that everyone should see this movie though i truly do
i remember seeing this film when it first came out in loved it then about years later i had the privilege of seeing luciano pavarotti sing at the metropolitan opera house in new york in tosca so seeing the ending of this film reminds me very much of that great night what s not to like about this film the music is brilliant and pavarotti fini was at his best and still looked great the story is actually very funny in parts the food fight scene is still one of the funniest i have ever seen the hot air balloon flight over the napa valley was beautiful so was the song he sang if we were in love one of the few times pavarotti sang in english and hearing the duet of santa lucia gorgeous get real folks this was a film about an opera singer called georgio fini who just happened to be played by pavarotti kathryn harrold eddie albert were excellent in their supporting roles i am very glad that i still have this almost worn out vhs tape of this movie but i would love this to be released on dvd especially now that pavarotti is no longer with us because i think this includes the best performance of nessun dorma sung by him still on film today
it s easy to forget once later series had developed the alien conspiracy plot arc more that once upon a time the x files wrote episodes like genderbender and fearful symmetry where the aliens weren t all little grey men or mind control goop but could actually surprise you fearful symmetry starts with an invisible elephant actually an elephant somehow dislocated in space and time not a mile away from the walk and ends with a pregnant gorilla being abducted and it s very much an episode of wonderful moments the subplot is annoyingly worthy yeah we get it zoos are bad except when they re not but the ideas that within it are fascinating visually powerful and very memorable and it covers an angle on abduction that is largely overlooked why would humans be the only things that aliens are interested in in the end it wasn t an instant classic but it was enjoyable viewing while it lasted again very memorable and mainly it s something that you couldn t imagine many other shows doing
this is a beautiful film the true tale of bond between father and son this is by far tom hanks at his finest tom hanks is really out of the box in this movie he usually has the nice guy roles yet in this film he comes off in this film as a bit gritty but still emerges smelling like a rose even until the very last scene the assassination of his character the cast of this movie was well put together i also love the part when there is total silence when tom hanks character shoots and kills all of the men in mr rooney s group there is something chilling and yet profound about no sound in that scene just simply emotion i love the look on john rooney paul newman s character s face when he realizes even before seeing him that it is tom hanks s character getting revenge and he knows his fate has come the first time i saw this movie i was blown away and knew i had to go out and get the video and i since have adding it to my collection of my all time favorite movies tom hanks is my favorite actor so this film has a special place in me
as far as i can recall balanchine s alterations to tchaikovsky s score are as follows the final section of the grossvatertanz a traditional tune played at the end of a party is repeated several times to give the children a last dance before their scene is over a violin solo written for but eliminated from tchaikovsky s score for the sleeping beauty is interpolated between the end of the party scene and the beginning of the transformation scene balanchine chose this music because of its melodic relationship to the music for the growing christmas tree that occurs shortly thereafter the solo for the sugar plum fairy s cavalier is eliminated it seems to me the accusation that balanchine has somehow desecrated tchaikovsky s great score is misplaced
goebbels motivation in backing down was not explored in the aftermath of stalingrad the reich had decided to go for total war this is referred to in the film part of this was to use women in the war effort which germany had not previously done to any great extent an ss massacre of women would have faced goebbels with a public relations disaster of massive proportion his preference was to make the problem go away as quietly as possible on the basis that the jewish men could always be rounded up later i understand the majority survived the war his other problem was that the red berlin had never been very enthusiastically behind the nazi cause and had to be handled cautiously again a massacre of women could have cost the nazis what mediocre level of support they had in their capital city it was interesting that the majority of ss uniforms showed patches which indicated that the men wearing them were not of german nationality but were from german origins in other countries such as lithuania or latvia
another one of those films you hear about from friends or read about on imdb not many false notes in this one i could see just about everything here actually happening to a young girl fleeing from a dead end home town in tennessee to florida with all her worldly possessions in an old beaten up car the heroine ruby makes some false starts but learns from them i found myself wondering why why didn t she lean a bit more on mike s shoulder but she has her reasons as it turns out just a fine film the only thing i don t much like about it i think is the title
i didn t expect val kilmer to make a convincing john holmes but i found myself forgetting that it wasn t the porn legend himself in fact the entire cast turned in amazing performances in this vastly under rated movie as some have mentioned earlier seek out the two disc set and watch the wadd documentary first it will give you a lot of background on the story which will be helpful in appreciating the movie some people seem unhappy about the lapd crime scene video being included on the dvd there are a number of reasons that it might have been included one of which is that john holmes trial for the murders was the first ever in the united states where such footage was used by the prosecution if you don t want to see it it s easy to avoid it s clearly identified as lapd crime scene footage on the menu
arguebly al pacino s best role he plays tony montana a small time hood from cuba turned into a rich and powerful crime lord in miami and he does it with the only two things he s got in this world his balls and his word and he doesn t break em for nobody starts as doing jobs for a big time cuban dealer frank lopez robert loggia and quickly goes up the ladder of the organization along with his long time friend manny steven bauer soon he has an eye for the boss s sexy wife elvira michelle pfeiffer after frank sees a threat from tony to his position he attempts to assassin tony but with no luck tony is upset and nothing can stop him now the film has a great supporting cast among them is f murray abraham as a jumpy gangster another familiar face is harris yulin as a crooked cop trying to shake down tony marry elizabeth mastrantonio as tony s young sister credits to the ecxellent screenplay by oliver stone this film is one of brian depalma s brightest points in his long ups and downs career you can see this guy is very talented the movie has a magnificent look to it also pay attention for two memorable scenes the one at the fancy restaurant say goodnight to the bad guy the other is the final shootout where tony shows that he still knows how to kick ass and kills about assassins that invaded to his house this is certainly one of the most impressive endings to a movie i have ever seen for fans of al pacino and crime movies it s a must see for the rest of you it s highly recommended
russian emigrant director in hollywood in william powell is casting his epic about the russian revolution and hires an old ex general from the czarist regime emil jannings to play the general of the film and the two relive the drama and the memory of the woman they shared evelyn brent of years before try as i might i feel it hard to warm to the last command for all its virtues the docks of new york was indubitably a great film and underworld is a film i have always been craving to see but the last command is rather heavy going the premise is fascinating but the treatment does really make the script come to life except in the sequences set in hollywood depicting the breadline of employable extras and the machinations of a big movie production with state of the art technology emil jannings is predictably a marvelous russian general distinguishing wonderfully between the traumatized and decrepit old ex general transfixed in his misery and the vigorous hearty officer of yore the ending is great and worth the wait but in order to get there you must prepared to be slightly bored at times
this film came out years years ago and was a revelation even for people who knew something of the drag scene in new york the textbooks on drag performance say nothing of these vogueing houses anthony slide s great pretenders says nothing julian fleisher s the drag queens of new york an illustrated field guide with its flow chart of influence that pulls together julian eltinge minette the warhol queens and the s club scene and postdates the film ignores the houses completely even laurence senelick s the changing room the closest thing that we have to a definitive book on drag performance rushes quickly past the film and does not give the background information that one would have expected from it i understand from the film itself and various articles i found on the web that this house system goes back decades the major film performance by a house member prior to seems to be chrystal la beija in the queen the historical context is the biggest missing part of paris is burning the film is valuable because it focuses on a scene otherwise being ignored it is a valuable snapshot of life in the unfortunate fact that venus xtravaganza was murdered during filming provides a very dramatic ending but this is not the only film about transsexuals to include a real life murder as we now know dorian corey had a mummified corpse in her literal closet but this did not come out until three years later of historical importance but we still need someone to do either a book or a documentary film that provides more context
this is one of those movies that s difficult to review without giving away the plot suffice to say there are weird things and unexpected twists going on beyond the initial superficial tom cruise screws around with multiple women plot the quality cast elevate this movie above the norm and all the cast are well suited to their parts cruise as the irritatingly smug playboy who has it all and then loses it all diaz as the attractive but slightly deranged jilted lover cruz as the exotic new girl on the scene and russell as the fatherly psychologist the story involves elements of romance morality murder mystery suspense and sci fi and is generally an entertaining trip i should add that the photography is also uniformly excellent and the insertion of various visual metaphors is beautiful once you realize what s going on if you enjoy well acted movies with twists and suspense and are prepared to accept a slightly fantastic philip k dick style resolution then this is a must see
i was pretty surprised with this flick even though their budjet was obviously lacking still you have to be impressed that this movie took years to make and still turned out good the acting was pretty impressive and the story really captivated me my only complaint would be that the ending really was a little too abrupt for my taste but hey if your audience is left wanting more then this movie has succeeded i would really recommend anyone in hollywood to look up antonella r os who is an excellent spanish talent something hard to find now days with all the bad novela over acting antonella r os truly is a star on the rise
too bad a couple of comments before me don t know the facts of this case it is based on actual events a highly publicized disappearance and murder case taking place in the wilmington de philadelphia pa region from through i have to admit i was highly skeptical of how hollywood would dramatize the actual history and events and was actually quite impressed on how close they stayed to what was constantly reported on local newscasts and philadelphia inquirer news stories throughout the time period of course i immediately pointed out that the actress who i really like in cold case who played fahey looked nothing like her anne marie was actually prettier i have to admit though that mark harmon really nailed the type of personality that was revealed as capano s and the behavior that capano exhibited throughout this period details of the case were right on no deviations of dramatic effect even down to the carpet gun furniture and cooler in conclusion i also wanted to add that i have met tom carper many times at various functions a good man despite being a politician and i am so glad that he pulled the strings in the federal realm necessary to solve this heinous crime guys like capano are real and it was great to see him finally put behind bars
if you want a fun romp with loads of subtle humor then you will enjoy this flick i don t understand why anyone wouldn t enjoy this one take it for what it is a vehicle for dennis hopper to mess with your head and make you laugh it ain t shakespeare but it is well done ericka eleniak is absolutely beautiful and holds her own in this one better than any episode of baywatch and shows a knack for subtle humor too bad she hasn t had many opportunities to expand on that tom berenger fits his role of real navy perfectly and william mcnamara does a solid job as a hustler throw in a walk on by hopper in the middle of the chase for the cherry on this sundae and you ve got a movie that kept my attention and kept me laughing i bought this one as soon as it was available brain candy
in his first go as a hollywood director henry brommell whips an enthralling yarn that is all of penetrating relatable marital issues with melancholic authenticity and lacing such with an equally absorbing subplot of a father son hit man business the film is directed astutely and consists of a wonderfully put together cast as well as a swift family conscious screenplay also by brommell that brings life to an otherwise fatigued genre as a bonus panic delivers subtle acerbic humor an unexpected undeniably charming and very welcome surprise through its bumbling unsure of himself low key star whose ever cool state is enticing especially given his line of work the forever great william h macy again captures our hearts as alex a unhappy torn middle aged husband and father who finds solace in the most dubious of persons a young attractive equally messed up year old named sarah neve campbell whom he meets in the waiting room at a psychologist s office where he awaits the therapy of dr josh parks john ritter to discuss his growing eagerness to quit the family business that his father donald sutherland built alex whose lust to lead a new life is obstructed by the fear of disappointing his dictating father strikes an unwise fancy for sarah which ultimately leads him to understand the essence and irrefutable responsibility of being a husband to his wife and more importantly to him a good father to his six year old son sammy played enthusiastically by the endearing david dorfman henry brommell s brilliant panic is something of a rarity in hollywood seldom seen with the exception of s road to perdition since its conception in it weaves two conflicting genres organized crime family drama into a fascinating warm hunk of movie viewing that is evenly strong in either direction and it s one that will maintain its exceptional infrequent caliber and gleaming sincerity for ages to come
my rating refers to the first seasons of stargate sg which are wonderfully fresh creative and addicting when the cast stepped through the gate you never knew what lay on the other side starting around season the show took a different focus still good but different the series follows the adventures of a team of humans and one alien who regularly venture into a planetary transport device called the stargate the backstory of the series is based on the characters and events of the movie stargate in which the device is discovered during an archaeological dig in egypt the episodes are light innocent and easy to watch and very creative many of the inventive stories could easily have been made into great sci fi movies of their own what happens next was always unpredictable the characters on which the show rests are also well defined and brilliantly performed their tone is serious but the dialog is flowered with incredible wit and humor they are simply fun to watch starting somewhere around season the series started to evolve into a continuing storyline based on fighting a single foe the goa uld then the ori the plots become more complex a lot more political strategic oriented and interdependent the characters were still as great as ever but the show was different in nature one thing that must be mentioned is to watch the episodes that commemorated the th and th episodes they are simply can t miss shows they exhibit the creative and wildly humorous genius that carried the series through seasons if you are a sci fi fan watch a few episodes of the first seasons and you ll likely be hooked if you like evolving story lines between two opposing sides you have seasons of shows to look forward to
when watching a bug s life for the first time in a long while i couldn t help but see the comparisons with last year s happy feet as far as the main storyline goes they are very similar an outcast doing what he can to fit in while also attempting to be special it just goes to show you how much better that film could have been without its liberal diatribe conclusion a lot of people disagree with me when i say that i really like pixar s sophomore effort sure it doesn t manage to capture the splendor of toy story nor is the animation out of this world however the story is top notch and the characters are wonderful to spend time with with plenty of laughs and a moral center to boot i could watch this one just as much as the studio s other classics there is a lot about finding strength from within to conquer all odds here between our lead flick needing to keep his self esteem up to save his colony the colony needing to open their eyes onto a new way of living for the future and the circus bugs finding that they are more than just untalented sideshow freaks everyone evolves into a better bug by the end of the story even the villain hopper is fully fleshed and menacing for the right reasons he is not doing it to be mean but instead understands the fact that the ants outnumber him to he needs them to fear him in order to not have to worry about them finding out the truth it is very much a circle of life but not one that can t evolve with the ages when thinking about the animation it is actually quite good compared to antz the rival film of the time this is much more realistic and less cartoony the water is rendered nicely as is the foliage you don t have to look much further than the ants eyes to see how much detail went into the production the reflections and moistness despite the smooth exterior shows the realism all the bugs are finely crafted too the flies in the city and the crazy mix of creatures recruited to save the ants are never skimped on whether for a small role or a more expanded one it is also in the city that we see the workmanship on the environments while ant island is nice it is just the outdoors bug city contains plenty of garbage doubling as buildings and clubs it is a great showing of humor and inventiveness to see what the animators used for everything from the ice cube trays as circus stands the animal crackers box as circus wagon complete with full nutrition guide on the side and crazy compilation of boxes to create a times square of billboards and facades everything is done right as far as much of the humor you have to credit the acting talent for wonderful delivery and inspired role choices no one could do a male ladybug better than dennis leary with his acerbic wit i dare you to think of someone better our leads are great too with dave foley as flick and julia louis dreyfus as princess atta as well as the always fantastic kevin spacey as hopper spacey not only steals many scenes from the movie but also takes center stage in the bloopers during the credits yes a bug s life was the originator of animated outtakes from pixar a tradition that has continued on with many tongue in cheek bug jokes laced throughout you also have to give props to the huge supporting cast full of those guy actors it is people like richard kind brad garrett and the late joe ranft as heimlich the worm who bring the biggest laughs overall it may be the simplest story brought to screen by pixar one that has been told in one form or the other numerous times over the years but it is inspired enough and fresh enough to deliver an enjoyable experience there are joyous moments sad times and even action packed scenes of suspense with birds coming in to join the fun complete with a couple of my favorite pixar characters tuck and roll there isn t too much bad that i can think of saying about it
i remember watching this in the s then i have just recently borrowed a couple of episodes from our public library with a nearly year hiatus i have come to another conclusion most of the principals interviewed in this series some at the center of power like traudl junge hitler s secretary karl doenitz head of germany s navy anthony eden uk are long gone but their first hand accounts will live on from generals and admirals to sergeants russian civilians concentration camp survivors all are on record here i can remember the lord mountbatten interview killed in the s this is truly a gem and i believe the producer of this series was knighted by queen elizabeth for this work well deserved seeing these few episodes from the library makes me want to buy the set this is the only i have given any review but i have discovered like a fine bottle of wine it is more appreciated with a little time
this is one of my favorite sports movies dennis quaid is moving and convincing in the part of a man who gave up his dream of being a baseball pitcher when his arm gave out on him as a high school coach he challenges his players to win the division championship by telling them he ll try out for a baseball team if they do they win partly because of all the batting practice they take with a coach who can pitch over miles an hour and he keeps his side of the bargain and is signed if you have ever decided to try something new and terrifying as an adult jim morris s story will resonate with you it is moving and inspiring and the man s relationships ring true inspiration is not the only reason i rent this one though dennis quaid is just downright purdy in the part and a baseball movie with a good looking man changing a diaper is my idea of heaven ladies if you feel the way i do check this one out
a bit slow and boring the tale of an old man and his wife living a delapidated building and interacting with a fixed cast of characters like the mailman the brothers sitting on the porch the wealthy cigar smoking man the photography of the river is marvelous as is the interior period decoration if you like decoration of banana republic stores this is a must
undoubtedly one of the great john ford s masterpieces young mr lincoln went practically unnoticed at the time of its initial release no wonder because the year was when many of the greatest movies of the whole cinema history had been released including the most mythical western in the history of the genre john ford s milestone stagecoach and many others such as gone with the wind the wizard of oz mr smith goes to washington which took the oscar in the only category young mr lincoln was nominated for which is original screenplay it continued to be the most underrated ford s film for many years ahead destined to gradually fade away in the shadow of other john ford s masterpieces but by the end of the s american and european film critics and historians took a hold of a note written by legendary russian director sergei eisenstein about the young mr lincoln where he praised it and acknowledged that if he would only have had an opportunity to direct any american film ever made till then it would be definitely john ford s young mr lincoln impressed by such an undoubted preference from eisenstein critics began to see the film again but only with a bit different eyes and film s reputation has been increasing ever since it was far not for the first time the life of one of the most legendary american presidents was brought to the screen right in the beginning of the s griffith did it in his abraham lincoln and the same year as ford s film mgm released john cromwell s one called abe lincoln in illinois curiously enough both of them were based on a very successful broadway stage play released in and written by robert sherwood as far as john ford s films are concerned we can easily find many references to the life and deeds and even death of mythical lincoln s figure in several of director s works such as the iron horse or the prisoner of the shark island the second one just as young mr lincoln utilizes as the main musical theme the favourite lincoln s song dixie the screenplay based on a previously mentioned stage play and lincoln s biographies was written by lamar trotti in collaboration with john ford himself which was quite a rare thing for ford to do but final result was simply superb a script combining elements of the play with several historical facts as well as myths and legends about the beginning of abraham lincoln s life and law practice culminating in a hilarious but mostly heartbreaking trial scene which is the film s highest point and main laugh and tears generator where lincoln defends the two young brothers accused of a murder and have to devise a manner to help their mother too when she is brought before the court as a witness and where the prosecuting attorney played by donald meek demands her to indicate which one of her sons actually committed the murder obviously obliging her to the making of an impossible choice of condemning to death one and letting live the other overall it s a very touching heart warming and even funny film with simply magnificent performance from henry fonda in his supreme characterization of abraham lincoln and with overwhelming richness of other characters no matter how little or how big they are incarnated from the wonderful and intelligent screenplay and conducted by the ability of john ford s genius at one of its best deliveries ever a definite must see for everyone
this indie film looks at the lives of a group of people taking an adult swim class in connecticut the plot is fairly thin what drives the film is the characters excellently played by mostly unknown actors standouts in the cast are brewster as a high school teacher experiencing marital problems and weixler as a casino dealer who moonlights as a stripper the two actresses give natural performances and work well together this is an impressive feature film debut for writer schechter and director setton the latter keeps the narrative moving at a fast clip the film title and poster suggest something raunchy but this is a marvelous little comedy drama
marion davies stars in this remarkable comedy show people released by mgm in davies plays a hick from savannah georgia who arrives in hollywood with her father dell henderson the jalopy they arrive in is a hoot as is davies outrageous southern costume davies lands a job in slapstick comedy not what she wants but it brings her success she meets fellow slapstick star william haines who is immediately smitten with her well davies then gets a job at a more prestigious studio high art studios and lands a job in stuffy period pieces a handsome but fake actor andre telefair shows her the ropes of how to be the typical pretentious hollywood star davies abandons her slapstick friend and father for the good life but of course learns that is not who she really is marion davies is wonderful throughout as she outrageously runs the gamut of emotions required of a serious actress william haines is his usual wonderful comedic self and there are cameos by charles chaplin john gilbert and other famous stars of the day including the director of the film king vidor this is a silent film with a few sound effects as sound pictures were just coming into their own a treasure of a film
if the cabinet of dr caligari is the father of all horror films and of german expressionist cinema this pre wwi film is the grandfather the titular student starving in an empty garret makes a deal with the devil the devil gives him a bottomless sack of gold in exchange for anything in this room the devil chooses the student s reflection in his mirror he walks off with the student s doppelganger who commits crimes for which the student is blamed the film is marred by some limitations arising out of the technically primitive state of filmmaking the plot cries out for chiaroschuro effects but the film is of necessity virtually all shot in shadowless daylight but the scene where the reflection walks out of the mirror still packs a wallop more interesting for the trends it fortells than for its own sake the student of prague is still worthwhile
i don t know whether to recommend this movie to the fans of tetsuo or not why tetsuo because you can easily label some things about this movie as a very obvious tetsuo rip off the concept is similar editing is equally frantic and fast which is good because aside from making the movie more dynamic it obscures some flaws caused by low budget and other factors there is lot more gore less eroticism and in the case of meatball machine the transformation of human being into a creature that s partially a machine sounds familiar called necroborg very original is caused by slimy little aliens these slimy little scums from outer space actually use human beings as vessels for their gladiator games that they play with each other they infest the body somehow manage to put an insane amount of mechanical parts in it pulling them seemingly out of nowhere and turn it into a killing machine that targets other necroborgs their aim is to defeat another alien who is in another necroborg rip it out of the corpse and eat it all in all the plot sounds somewhat silly and i didn t expect much but at the end i actually enjoyed this film as i said before this is a low budget flick but it s still relatively decent don t expect much from actors they re mostly not very good but it can be tolerated i liked the atmosphere and gore certain bizarre situations and the way the movie is directed and edited although the story is not too original it possesses certain charm to me at least out of
absolutely hilarious john waters tribute to the people he loves most baltimoreans is a twisted little ditty with plenty to look at and laugh at it s like being turned loose in a museum of kitsch i haven t laughed so much in a theater since serial mom i loved seeing old friends from the dreamland days sharon nisep and susan lowe back in front of waters camera the cast is simply wonderful especially edward furlong and martha plimpton uses the best elements of past waters atrocities especially the underrated polyester and plenty of new surprises made me sick in a wonderful way thanks john
good times working with the quiroz brothers and the entire cast on this project as the guy on the bench i was amazed how well they accomplished capturing all the identifiable traits of a true b horror film hopefully i will have the opportunity to work with pumpkin patch pictures team again in the future i moved to detroit shortly after completion and have been recognized in public on several occasions since the release one time was actually in the video store and the girl damn near lost her mind it was pretty funny and that was my st real autograph moment as i signed her receipt one day i asked the girl at blockbuster if the movie is rented often and she confirmed by looking it up in the computer at the time it was renting more than ring which was also a new release at the time the title really captures immediate interest in the more urban markets she also noticed on many occasions the movie had not been returned by the customer leading me to believe the movie is just so good people don t want to give it back watch out for zombies when in the hood cause they will get ya jaysun barr guy on the bench
this production was made in the middle s and appears to be the first serious attempt to put bleak house on celluloid no film version of the novel was ever attempted it is remarkably rich in subplots that actually serve as counterpoints to each other so that it would have been very hard to prune it down the novel was the only attempt by dickens to make a central narrator one of two in the work a woman esther summerson esther is raised by her aunt and uncle who in typical dickens style mistreat her she is illegitimate but they won t tell her anything about her parentage later we get involved with the gentry sir leicester dedlock and his wife lady honoria deadlock dame diana rigg is having an increasingly difficult time regarding her private life and the meddling involvement of the family solicitor tulkinghorn peter vaughn we also are involved with the actions of richard carstone esther s boyfriend in trying to win a long drawn out estate chancery case jarndyce v jarndyce which everyone even richard s cousin john jarndyce played by desmond elliot warns is not worth the effort dickens had been a law reporter and then a parliamentary reporter before he wrote fiction starting with the breach of promise case in pickwick papers dickens looked closely at the law mr bumble said it was a ass in oliver twist and dickens would consistently support that view he looks at the slums as breeding grounds for crime in twist that the law barely tries to cure he attacks the chancery and outdated estate laws as well as too powerful solicitors and greedy lawyers tulkinghorn vholes in bleak house in little dorrit he attacks the debtors prisons he had hit it also in david copperfield in our mutual friend he looks at testators and wills in the mystery of edwin drood he apparently was going to go to a murder trial dickens was far more critical of legal institutions than most of his contemporaries including thackeray but the novel also looks at other problems like charity and religious hypocrisy the budding scotland yard detective force social snobbery in the industrial revolution he also uses the novel to satirize various people leigh hunt the writer inspector fields of scotland yard and even the notorious maria manning most of these points were kept in this fine mini series version if it is shown again on a cable station catch it
in reflecting on this movie i can think of two others to help put it in perspective one relatively forgettable but covering the same geography is coup de torchon the other thousands of miles away and much larger in scope is the unforgettable indochine claire denis has produced a movie that has some of the grand underpinnings of indochine the complex and unspoken relationship between france and her colonial subjects i was struck with the dignity of potee with his struggle to maintain his dignity among his peers and with his white bosses i was also struck with the love hate relationship between him and aimee it is the latter that gives the film its driving force it is the latter that links this movie to indochine one never is sure what motivates everyone though some of the characters are required of a remembrance of colonialism it is this cynical side of the story that ties it to coup de torchon theirs is the more scandalous story perhaps even more interesting in a depraved way but denis gives us a remembrance of how it was with all the tension and unresolved relationships the american black who gives the grown up france a ride in the beginning and end of the movie offers yet another interesting side to the confusion that we in the western world have when we look at africa he says that when he came he wanted to call everyone brother he was coming home but they just thought him to be a little daft france the character and the girl grew up in cameroon but neither fully understands what it is even though they can remember how it was
atlantis the lost empire was everything the previews indicated it would be it is not often you find that most of the time the previews show only the best parts and then the rest of the movie is terrible not so with this one i was pleased with the original plot even though the sub plots were not the animation was not break through like shrek but it was good none the less the plot and the story line were well presented and there were only a few slow spots in them this keeps you interested i found myself enjoying this one atlantis gets and keeps your attention you also have to think a little bit but not too much once you think about it a little you can figure out what needs to happen but you really don t know for sure how it is going to happen the casting was also good michael j fox as milo was an excellent choice his personality fits nicely the gruff natured commander rourke was also well chosen with james garner his character reminded me of his performance in maverick which i also liked i really liked the casting of claudia christian as helga sinclair her ability to play a no nonsense personality makes the film more interesting it s just too bad she is a villain over all definitely worth you while out of
okay i ll admit it i am a goof ball and i occasionally love a really silly comedy while i have seen more films by kurosawa bergman and truffaut than practically anyone on the planet i still have a soft spot for a dopey comedy that doesn t try to be sophisticated but is simply funny a few such films that immediately come to mind are monty python and the holy grail uhf start the revolution without me strange brew and the bill and ted movies they all lack snob appeal but only a zombie or professional film critic could dislike them while bill ted s bogus journey isn t as wonderful as the original bill and ted film it still is great fun also unlike the original it actually seems to improve with repeated viewing i remember not loving the film the first time i saw it possibly because the other movie set such a high standard for laughs but every time i see it again i am amazed at all the great moments particularly those involving the grim reaper and by the way this reaper is about as different from bergman s in the seventh seal as you can get in addition to a lot of laughs this film features some excellent music one way that it s actually better than the first film the kiss anthem at the end is great but so are the rest of the hard rock tunes provided you aren t an old killjoy like de nomolos great viewing for kids and adults alike
well the movie isn t exactly funny okay i admit there are a few humorous lines but definitely nothing that is laugh out loud funny for example right before a steamy sex scene between eleniak and one of her male costars sh is handcuffed to the bedpost and he cannot remove her shirt before leaving the room to retrieve the key he tells her okay don t go anywhere see humorous but not funny the plot and acting are pretty good but erika eleniak definitely steals the show she s hot and sexy and there is a really steamy scene with her that one can t help but rewind and re watch there are also some other very sexy scenes with her and she has some very provocative lines overall stars i d only give it three if not for erika eleniak
the part where meg visits the mechanic and he says is the piston firing short implying poor sexual energy on the part of her fianc e was hilarious i love meg ryan and she is as sweet as ever in this wonderful movie very lovable and very intelligent too her innocent indignant expressions have you wishing she was yours the hero handles the garage mechanic to physicist transformation well einstein had a romantic side to his psyche the puzzle round in front of the press and audience was done well it s awfully underrated and deserves accolades and attempts at a revival it loses out one vote for including the highly improbable far fetched theory being bought by the us govt i don t see why it doesn t figure in the top romantic comedies of the century great movie it has the presidential seal of approval on it
the group of people are travelling to belgrade in an awful bus led by a drunk conductor and his dumb son who likes to drive with his eyes closed their journey is frequently interrupted by many hilarious events which with much irony describe the fall of nation s spirit in and are so funny that they are even today used as a common jokes the man who steals the show is a peasant feet tall with his sons who are almost two times bigger than him in the end the movie takes one dramatical turn and the trip becomes nothing but a swan s song of a dying country

this is one of the best fred astaire ginger rogers films or at least one of my favorites most of the a r movies feature great dancing but sappy romance stories this still has the courtship corniness but not as pronounced as the other films this movie features not just great dancing but likable characters and a bunch of good songs the music is the central theme here and what s nice is the addition of a tap solo by rogers she not only was a super dancer but a very pretty woman and one with tremendous figure she dances also with fred of course and they re always a fun pair to watch on the dance floor growing up in the s watching ozzie harriet on television it was a real kick the first time i saw this to see such a young harriet hilliard no surprise than ozzie fell for this beauty although she had that short early s hairstyle i recognized her voice right away also in this movie are quick appearances by betty grable and lucille ball but i have to admit that i have yet to out ball i can t find her but i know she s in here astaire except for some obnoxious gum chewing in the first third of the film was fun to watch and randolph scott although better in westerns is likable too this is simply a nice feel good film and good one if you want to to enjoy the great talents of astaire and rogers
one of the funnest mario s i ve ever played the levels are creative there are fluid controls and good graphics for its time there s also a multitude of crazy bosses and enemies to fight sometimes the levels get frustrating and if you leave out some of the hard levels and still need to get more accomplished to fight a boss it can be annoying another complaint is the camera angle though it works fairly well most of the time it can be a pain in certain situations if your a big time mario fan this ones for you even if your not a huge fan of him i d still recommend this one its a big game and getting what you need can take a while but it s very satisfying good for playing in short bursts of time it will almost certainly hold your interest it sure does hold mine
there is no such a thing as perfect murder lieutenant columbo knows that ken franklin who is the other half of the writing team of detective stories doesn t know that he kills his partner jim ferris who had plans on going solo now columbo steps into the picture and asks all sorts of questions from mr franklin and returns for one more question columbo murder by the book is directed by the young steven spielberg before his days of fame steven bochco wrote it columbo is a fantastic character with his shabby look it s hard to believe this man could solve any crime but he could each and every one of them peter falk is the one and only person in the world that could portray this character so no remakes please this part is a very good example of how columbo worked jack cassidy plays the murderer and martin milner plays the victim rosemary forsyth plays the victim s wife joanna ferris there s something endearing in the scenes between columbo and her how he makes the omelet and everything barbara colby plays lilly la sanka she actually met a tragic fate when she died after a homicide like she does here i ve been a fan of columbo since childhood and i still enjoy watching them there was a break for many years that they weren t showing columbo stories at all but now he s back back for one more question
paris je t aime is a film made up of segments you can do the math segments in minutes means each director had seven minutes to tell her or his story the movie is based on the premise that you can indeed tell a story in that short amount of time the premise works almost all of the segments are powerful complete and satisfying each presents a different aspect of the parisian experience and almost every director draws forth outstanding performances from a cast of great and near great actors there were so many powerful portrayals in this film that it s hard to pick one or two favorites probably the most memorable to me were juliette binoche as a grieving mother in the segment place des victoires gena rowlands as an aging beauty in quartier latin catalina sandino moreno as a maid in the segment loin du me and margo martindale as a colorado mail carrier who has learned to speak french so she can visit paris me arrondissement segment special mention must be given to gulliver hecq probably the meanest little boy to ever harass an american tourist in a parisian metro station segment tuileries this is an outstanding movie my wife and i decided to rent it in a few months so we can catch some of the subtle points we surely missed however paris is photographed so beautifully that i would suggest that you try to see it on a large screen in any case don t miss it

the odd couple is the classic film version of neil simon s most famous play about a tv newswriter named felix unger who is an obsessive neat freak who moves in with his divorced best friend oscar madison a sportswriter and complete slob after his wife frances throws him out of their apartment already divorced oscar takes his best friend in and regrets it from the moment he does it neil simon s classic comedy first came to broadway with art carney playing felix and walter matthau playing oscar jack lemmon takes over for carney in the film version with a memorable performance as felix unger lemmon is not only terribly funny in the role but so vividly real that he brings an element of melancholy to the pitiful figure that is felix unger matthau fortunately was allowed to recreate his role as oscar a one of a kind gem of comic performance that provides consistent laughs throughout this teaming of lemmon and matthau turned out to be comic gold that was re visited in nine other films with both of these actors no longer with us the viewing of this classic becomes more touching but no less hilarious simon s play has been nicely expanded for the screen with a silent prologue chronicling a depressed felix s suicide attempt that is a winner the supporting cast includes herb edelman john fiedler larry haines and david sheiner as oscar s poker playing buddies and moncia evans and carole shelley as the piedgon sisters blind dates of oscar and felix of course it later became an excellent tv series with tony randall and jack klugman but there s nothing like the original a joy from start to finish
i agree whole heartedly with the comments so far i remember this documentary as being one of the most amazing and informative i ve ever seen as stated before i recall that i began watching thinking it was just another nature study interesting not necessarily special but i was so wrong not only was the story of the colony incredible but i remember the music as being so much a part of it s appeal if i remember correctly it was native americn pipes akin to the music at the end of one flew over the cookoo s nest i too have been looking for a copy this should be required watching for anybody but especially the schools it should be re released
look if i were interested in a nancy drew book what i would do is pick up a book and read it i m not ever since i can remember i read people trashing movies because it wasn t like the book i m sorry in the digital age we can no longer watch movies on flip books however i m sure you can still find a few short silent films in book form when lord of the rings came out people complained when the third one won an oscar the book was better when i watched to kill a mockingbird the book was better now a bunch of people are upset yet again because nancy drew wasn t like the book i m not saying nancy drew is going to win any oscars if anything it ll be one of those nickelodeon blimps or kids choice awards i m saying give film a break it s film not paper as a movie i found nancy drew quite enjoyable featuring cameos from bruce willis and adam goldberg the hebrew hammer and supporting roles featuring tate donovan jimmy cooper on the o c and rachel leigh cook she s all that this is the first time i ve seen emma roberts in a movie and frankly i enjoy her work more than most of julia and of eric s her character stays consistent throughout the film and reacts well with conflict a lighthearted movie in the spirit of harriet the spy is nice now and again i give it ten stars because i thoroughly enjoyed the movie would love to see it again and will probably buy it upon dvd release
yet another remake of fistful of dollars sergio leone s remake of kurosawa s yojimbo suggested by the novel red harvest this one is strictly a b movie taken as that it is rather enjoyable the direction is crisp the acting full of verve the limitations of its direct to video photography well handled the weakness of the film is in the disastrous decision to marry the fistful yojimbo plot to a sub plot from leone s once upon a time in the west although leone directed both fistful and west his motivations behind the two films couldn t be anymore different the man with no name eastwood is a borderline socio path with a soft spot for broken families harmonica chaeles bronson is obsessed with his own broken family and obsessed with revenge these two characters would not have had much to do with each other in order to bring them together gun crazy has to twist it s plot and complicate it until we lose track of which story we re actually following but this is a b movie after all and filled with action and silliness it s entertaining on that level just don t expect anything more
very different topic treated in this film a straightforward and simple description of local chinese customs by looking at the daily operation of a public bath run by the old owner and his retarded son when older son returns home wrongly believing his father has died how every man in town makes his daily visit to chat play games discuss personal matters and get honest advice besides the usual spa like therapies when old man dies strong and loyal family ties make older son take charge so public bath operation is not disrupted and finally the arrival of modernization to end this way of spending relaxed hours and getting along the public bath has to be demolished making place for a commercial complex to be constructed
i used to watch pufnstuf every weekend when i was about it was on right after bay city rollers i saw it come on to family channel one day and taped it for my then three year old daughter i d forgotten all the things i d loved as a child the magic flute the zoom broom witcheepoo s makeup this show is decidedly low tech the mayor is surely a precedent to mayor mccheese and everyone is a stuffed creature with annoying googly eyes but kids love this stuff they would way way rather watch a guy work a sock puppet than sit in front of high tech computer animation there is mild slapstick but no adult themes such as sex or people dying and kids accept jimmy s schemes kids think it would be neat to carry a bag of smoke around and convince someone their house was on fire and i loved how every time my daughter saw a jet stream in the sky she thought witchypoo was flying overhead the music is old but you really get used to it and my daughter really loved it she used to sing different is hard different is lonely in the car my daughter watched this show at least once a day for about months and it s still one of her favourites i see that a new pufnstuf is in the works i really hope they try to keep the old flavour and don t do anything like computer animating characters etc i think a whole new generation would love pufnstuf
i saw this movie once on late night t v and knew it was the best movie ever this is one of the few kung fu movies with a decent plot the progression of the main character is seamless the whole movie is great
michael curtiz directed this very stylish whodunit from a script by robert presnell sr robert n lee and peter mine the original novel they adapted was the kennel murder case perhaps from a writer s standpoint the best of the philo vance mysteries by the strange s s van dine vance was a long worded and superior detective genius and his character being assigned to william powell probably meant the executives at warner brothers were aware of the possibility that in less engaging hands this detective might alienate viewers fortunately they assigned suave william powell first to the character later he was played by basil rathbone warren william and paul lukas before being consigned to b picture status the other question as always with warner brothers executives is why they chose vance as a character their penchant was to choose men who operated outside the law with no apparent discrimination between a vicious murderer and a champion of individual rights against all comers this film has a despicable villain who gets murdered and a claustrophobically challenging locale inside an apartment complex the characters are unarguably unusually well realized the direction rather good and unusually swift paced and except for a darkish b w look the film avoids the comedic asides superfluous characters and irrelevant dialogue characteristic of many early detective entries jack okey did the good art direction the music by berhard kaun is serviceable orry kelly did the costumes william reese provided the mostly indoor cinematography in the interesting cast powell is the philo vance of his time mostly sober minded with just a hint of sardonic humor here and there eugene palette is better than usual playing very straight as an admiring police partner to vance with his very professional timing the other actor who comes off best is handsome paul cavangh very effective as always in what was written as a red herring part mary astor is attractive but at this point in her career she talked a bit too fast to be as effective as she later proved also in the cast were helen vinson as the villain s woman jack la rue ralph morgan best known as frank morgan s brother robert barrat as the villain everyone has cause to kill archer coe and frank conroy as his likable brother with robert mcwade as the d a quirky and funny etiienne girardot has a delightfully witty part as the funny little forensics doctor who comes onto the crime scene james lee as the abused chinese servant is excellent and intelligent the story breaks into four parts first there is shad doings at a dog show where vance coe and cavanagh are all showing west highland terriers cavanagh s dog is killed by coe to prevent him winning the title over his own entry the second portion of the scene involves a leave taking someone is confused enough by who has gone where after coe parts from his girl friend vinson to murder his nice brother by mistake enter vance to find out who did in archer coe in a locked room and how with the help of palette the romantic difficulties are straightened out the chinese servant is exonerated we find out who broke the expensive vase who will marry whom how archer coe was done in and why the butler did not do it but someone else with a good excuse did this is a more than good little mystery which skilled hungarian born director curtiz took quite seriously he used wipes swift cuts changes of camera angle and alternations between straightforward and daring camera work to achieve variety interest and a sustained pace many writers critics and experts myself included consider this to be the best of the vance projects although others are estimable as well
i have been a fan of this movie for years and years because of teri hatchers move into the forefront i had to take the movie off the shelf and watch it why people back in did not see how wonderful this movie was in beyond me sally field and kevin kline are beyond fabulous although i never have watching daytime soap operas this movie kills me every time i watch it the acting is second to none for a comedy and the writing is so smart i highly recommend that you watch this if you haven t already you will get to see elizabeth shue whoopi goldberg teri hatcher and carrie fisher to name a few all give splendid performances
i love this show i watch all the reruns every day even though i have seen all of them like time s each it s about two sisters holly amanda bynes and val jennie garth who live in new york holly goes to live with val when their dad is transferred to japan val has the perfect life she has a boyfriend and a perfect apartment of the upper east side the show basically shows all the problems vall and holly go through the main problem is guys but also is about being responsible and other life choices holly is and is a total free spirit while val is the complete opposite she is the organized has to have a plan to do anything kind of person the other characters are henry vince gary lauren and tina
thank god abc picked this up instead of fox the best description for those in the know is really wonderfalls meets dead like me in the best way possible i m not sure whether an experience with death and destiny early in life makes me a fan of brian fuller but i certainly enjoy his productions i also enjoy checkered floors pies talking toys gravelings and other mischievous items while a bit burtonesque i certainly think this enjoys its own niche that doesn t require j depp or hb carter to be a wonderfully imaginative playground here we can find the joys and sorrows of childhood and adulthood crashing into each and actually making sense and making us want to live life to the fullest
i loved the the film it beautifully analyzes italian petty bourgeois society how the leftists of the s have given up all their ideals and come to a happy arrangement which they don t want disturbed for instance the aging psychoanalyst who is jealous of his own son and doesn t want to be reminded of his more radical youth for a long time wanted to buy the video after having seen the movie a couple of times on the big screen and on tv but it seems to have completely disappeared from the market even in italy no one in the book shops knew about the film a great pity the one sex scene which everyone seems to go on about does the film no harm
i liked top gun it held my interest predictable plot decent character development and story line it is pretty similar to high noon in that the town people appear weak and scared to stand up to a villain this movie has some quality actors who really did not get a chance to share all of their talents also some of the actors did not receive credit for their roles denver pyle was a good looking man in his younger days john dehner rod taylor are outstanding in their roles sterling hayden did the best that he could with poor material it is hard to imagine him as a gunslinger laura played by karen booth was a nauseating character she seemed flattered that two men may have been fighting over her ugh finally how can people travel without luggage especially women
one of hung s better early efforts the humor is dead on in parts as hung tries to imitate lee s moves and facial expressions and also in a bit where hung pokes fun at jackie chan s drunken master the action is also pretty good especially when hung takes on a trio on martial arts experts at the end it s not the greatest film but pretty good for s kung fu especially if you re a fan of hung and or lee be warned though most video versions of the movie have pretty shoddy quality there is also a character in blackface which some people might find offensive sammo hung is a rural swine herder who moves to hong kong to fight off some bad guys sammo turns on his dead on bruce lee impersonation when fighting this film is often billed as a parody of bruce lee s enter the dragon but it s not exactly that sammo is a rural swine herder obsessed with bruce lee who moves to hong kong to help his relatives run a small open air restaurant once situated at the new job he is forced to defend the eatery from local gangsters looking for protection money when sammo switches into fighting mode he switches on his bruce lee impersonation which must be seen to be believed this film is pretty sloppy in many of the fight scenes sammo battles against people who are obviously actors rather than martial artists and there s one character who s supposed to be black who is played by an asian man in heavy and preposterous makeup but what this film lacks in budget and accuracy it more than makes up for in atmosphere and energy highly recommended for a good mood
this movie was very good because it remember when i was young when i maked snow castle it was so fun this movie is interessant this is a good quebeker movie with no much money and is also a magical movie because their wonderfull castle is very big and beautiful
if unlike some of the commenters here you are not staging a class war and don t mind seeing the lives of other people who are fairly successful extroverted bohemian gasp and not being terribly english at a party and getting into all sorts of trouble as a result this is not a bad film closer to euro cinema rather than an imitation of the usual slick american crap i believe the minimal sound design and cheap camera is a conscious decision rather than bad film making i d defend this the film isn t any worse as a result and it puts the spotlight on the cast some of whom are really good kate hardie think that s her name as the sarcastic drunk is spot on the one exception being david baddiel who should never be allowed to appear in serious stuff it s light and we don t go for this kind of anatomising of relationship crap in this country but if you don t have any real friends to go to a party with than you could do worse than to sit in and watch this
i think that the idea of the plot is perfect for exploring first of all the emotional experiences of the people involved and second as someone else wrote in a comment the implications of this kind of relationships incest and lesbianism in the romanian society so to begin with the second aspect to make it short it wasn t visible at all as for the first as i said it had much more potential i think that those kind of relationships carry much more tension much more tension and the potential tension didn t get through i think the soundtrack could ve been more than those few songs on the background and the theme wich was nice but not enough and not always in the right moments yeah i could feel the absence of a better soundtrack the actors i think that they were somewhere from to not enough sensuality in the key moments a total of mostly for the story
i participate in a filmmaker s symposium and this film was shown after we had already seen a not so great film and participated in a minute discussion even though it was incredibly late and we were weary the entire audience really enjoyed it personally i thought the film was hilarious in all the right spots and i loved the quirky cast of characters they really grow on you in the film
although there were a few rough spots and some plot lines that weren t exactly true to character this was classic h lots the characters outside of mike giardello giancarlo esposito were true to form and the reunion scenes of pembleton andre braugher and bayliss kyle secor were as deep and well acted as anything ever to grace the small screen homicide the movie aka life everlasting is a fan flick but stands on its own as well as any hour episode of the series fontana overmeyer and yoshimura did a wonderful job in pulling loose ends from seasons and every major cast member of the best damn show on television together for the series finale that nbc never bothered to give it true to homicide form there were no happy endings such is life that s what has always set this show apart from the mindless cookie cutter cop shows left on television kudos to the writers and the cast for creating something over the span of the series and in the movie that challenged television viewers and producers alike i call myself a homicidal maniac if for no other reason than to keep my co workers in a cooperative mood
this movie surprised me it had good one liners and laughs a nonstop action packed storyline with tons of gun action and explosions this movie surprisingly had a lot of good twists and turns the plot is solid despite what others may think it kept my interest the whole time right up till the very end in conclusion this is a great way for an action movie buff to spend time on
have to be honest and say that i haven t seen many independent films but i thought this one was very well done the direction and cinematography were engaging without becoming a distraction the angles settings and lighting used successfully created the nightmarish world in which the main character was trapped many haunting and memorable images from the film stick in your mind long after it s over always a sign of a good director
i saw this movie once as a kid on the late late show and fell in love with it it took years but i recently did find it on dvd it wasn t cheap either in a catalog that specialized in war movies we watched it last night for the first time the audio was good however it was grainy and had the trailers between reels even so it was better than i remembered it i was also impressed at how true it was to the play the catalog is around here someplace if you re sincere in finding it fire me a missive and i ll see if i can get you the info cartwrightbride yahoo com
i loved this movie i knew it would be chocked full of camp and silliness like the original series i found it very heart warming to see adam west burt ward frank gorshin and julie newmar all back together once again anyone who loved the batman series from the s should have enjoyed return to the batcave you could tell the actors had a lot of fun making this film especially adam west and i ll bet he would have gladly jumped back into his batman costume had the script required him to do so i told a number of friends about this movie who chose not to view it now they wished they had i have all of the original episodes on vhs now this movie will join my collection thank you for the reunion adam and burt
scream was wes craven s last decent thriller since then there has been nothing but an unbearable streak of hollywood trash barely good enough for a blockbuster night including the disappointment of the scream sequels perhaps the genius and the craftsmanship devoted to the movie drained all the energy and creativity out of him so that when it came time for supper he had nothing to serve us but his own doo doo finally after who knows how many bad movies later he gives us a delicious ruthless gripping chilling suspense thriller with red eye rachel mcadams once again delivers an enjoyable performance as she plays a hotel manager who has the unfortunate connection with an important political figure and regular at her hotel then she meets jackson ripner cillian murphy batman beyond at the airport who she gets to know a little better after a delayed flight and a bay breeze what she doesn t know is he already knows her and he also knows her father who she will never see again if she fails to cooperate and meet jackson s demands to use her connections to set up her hotel regular for assassination you re probably thinking this is nothing but your everyday thriller complete with predictability and chase scenes although this is a good old fashioned thriller that s the beauty of it no special effects no cheap make up just classic suspense you feel the desperation and regret with every decision mcadams is forced to make and you actually care for her as you cheer her on every move she makes to find an escape from her claustrophobic position as always she delivers an entertaining and convincing performance it s either her sweet face or her uncanny ability to sincerely cry but you always seem to sympathize with her if her role demands it cillian murphy on the other hand is naturally creepy looking so even if the trailer didn t reveal it his ultimate transition from charming stranger to merciless jackass isn t so surprising perhaps it would have been more trippy to see a nice guy persona like toby maguire transforming into evil relentless madman nevertheless cillian murphy after his true identity is established played the role so solidly you d really want him to die or at least get his ass kicked don t overlook this feature there are plenty of chalkboard screeching moments and heart jumpers that will keep your eyes on the screen instead of your watch like you would at craven s recent pictures if not for the you do it for all the times you ll see your girlfriend or boyfriend or someone with popcorn jump and cling on to you wes finally gets it right aside from his trademark mastery in suspense red eye is not without its humor as mcadams replacement cynthia at the front desk fumbles to keep the hotel in order it was a relief that red eye wasn t a disappointment instead you ll get the pleasure of seeing mcadams deliver another incredibly talented performance murphy look creepier by the minute and craven craft a classic traditional thriller a flight that was delayed and would have been the beginning of craven s renaissance had it arrived right after scream
i gotta be straight up i haven t seen a film as solid as dog bite dog in quite a while i m a big fan of the old school late s to mid s era catiii films and i had been hearing that that style of films is making a bit of a come back with films such as this and herman yau s gong tau which as of this writing i have not yet seen so i was very interested to give some of these newer wave catiii films a shot did this film live up to my expectations absolutely but not quite in the fashion that i imagined the story follows a young animalistic resourceful and virtually unstoppable thai hit man with a somewhat vague history who comes to hong kong to complete a mission due to some bad luck he is quickly identified by a roguish copy who exudes many of the same qualities as our hit man and is quickly apprehended and captured this state of affairs doesn t last long though as the un named assassin escapes from his captors and quickly shows the local police that he is not to be taken lightly the hunt is on and a cat and mouse game between the police and the mad dog as the police refer to him ensues along the way mad dog is inadvertently befriended by a slow witted young woman and a bond forms between the two when she helps him out of a sticky situation the ante keeps getting upped as mad dog s only objective is to get out of hong kong and back to thailand by any means necessary and the cops keep trying to reel him in alive i could probably write ten paragraphs about this complex and thoroughly layered film but i don t want to give too much away i watched dog bite dog knowing nothing about the premise and i think it s the type of film that is definitely better appreciated that way as to comparisons to the older style catiii films there are some similarities dog bite dog has some hyper violent moments reminiscent of the good ol days but is never quite as sleazy or grimy as old school classicks like the untold story or red to kill where many of the older catiii films main intention was to shock dog bite dog is a far more thought out and well rounded production though that s not to take anything away from those catiii films that i hold so dear this film is far more emotional than it is exploitative and as we learn more about the characters and their backgrounds the audience begins to bond and identify with both sides there really are no clear cut good and bad guys as mad dog shows moments of extreme compassion and the cops stoop to extremely unorthodox methods to try to flesh out the killer there s also no nudity sex in this film which is a typical characteristic of the older catiii films personally i would compare dog bite dog more to park s sympathy for mr vengeance or perhaps the pang brother s bangkok dangerous as both of those films mixed extremely emotional overtones with strong and unflinching action and violence again there s pretty much nothing that i didn t like about this film the acting is dead on the cinematography is sharp and well done and the whole film skillfully blends several different elements successfully in a way that isn t seen very often is this film and others like it the rebirth of the catiii film not exactly but it is a very solid film that s absolutely worth checking out
well its about time i had really given up any and all hope that there was going to be a standout episode among this season s entries while there have still been far too many drab to hohum entries at least this episode turned out well its rather funny that director rob schmidt who only has the not bad wrong turn to his credit and writer john esposito whose only scripting chores to date have included tale of the mummy and graveyard shift should be the ones to give us the best written and most thought provoking episode of the season in right to die we are treated to the story of cliff and abbey at the start of the episode the couple are having a conversation abbey has caught cliff cheating and he is desperately trying to win her back while they speak they find themselves in a car accident where cliff is left with only scratches and bruises but abbey is thrown from the car and catches on fire when a spark ignites and gasoline that had dripped onto her catches her on fire and this is just the setup people once in the hospital cliff must decide whether or not abbey should live in this state with no skin and only nerve reflexes there s also a side effect too every time she flatlines abbey goes a walking as a ghost and causes trouble for all sorts of people hands down this is the best episode of the season and certainly ranks as one of the top episodes ever from the gruesome effects to the taut script which threw in a few twists i never saw coming and suspense so palpable you can almost touch it right to die should have the right to go on living forever
i ve never seen many online movies in most of my life but if i d pick any of them i d pick spatula madness a clever reference to most movies like star trooper etc using a camera and wits of steel jason steele mastered the art of turning a normal image into a painting and then putting it all together with frame by frame animation to get a world inhabited by spatulas the story begins at the middle hows that for directors delight then the middle is at the beginning and so on when i first watched it i expected a soggy pixely look but jason like me loves looks so took every detail to the max although i don t recommend it for children or would anybody besides me like it but please search it up on the net its a short film look up film cow its style reminds me of south park but less violent for the look for the laughs and for the story it all comes to a good workjason steele i m anxious to see the movie
warning contains spoilers i have this adult friend for whom the notion that her parents have sex makes her terribly uneasy she came to mind when i reflected on the audience s reaction to the mother people gasped when may anne reid writhed passionately in bed with her younger hunk lover darren daniel craig or later saw sexually explicit drawings by may i doubt the audience was aghast at the nudity or the drawings content as much as feeling uneasy at seeing a woman in her s rapturously enjoying sex screenwriter hanif kureishi my beautiful laundrette my son the fanatic again proves why he s among the most trenchant storytellers on either side of the atlantic his story s not easy to take this searing family drama isn t a film you can claim you enjoyed watching because it s raw complex and often makes us very uncomfortable nevertheless it s powerfully good stuff kureishi and roger michell who directed notting hill of all things craft an unsentimental wrenching and superbly acted portrait of an older woman who realizes after all these years she can and should still enjoy all of life s pleasures in a wonderfully epiphanous moment when her son bobby asks her not to be difficult may shoots back why not why not indeed anne reid deserves an oscar nomination for her turn as may it s subtle restrained powerful and sad often all at the same time watch reid when may observes darren and paula cathryn bradshaw in a seemingly passionate clutch in a pub or when she begs paula to open the front door after a disastrous date reid s eyes and face reveal all of may s anguish and despair in the film s most devastating moment may drops to her knees before darren willing to do anything for him only asking him to be kind this is a tremendously gutsy performance by a remarkable actress i enjoyed michell s use of natural sound especially when may and toots first arrive at bobby s place it perfectly illustrated the cacophony around may and toots the flippant manner in which their own family welcomes them this film at times reminded me of the honesty and rawness of mike leigh s work except the mother hangs on to a slight sense of optimism to keep afloat my one quibble michell s decision to give may and darren s first love scene an almost cheesy sensibility the lovers remain out of focus while in the foreground a white curtain flutters gently in the breeze and the only sound is of may in the throes of passion the problem with michell s approach is that both reid and craig who completely envelops the role of darren plough their way so fearlessly into these roles that it s unfair to hide their characters almost primitive energy from the audience especially since michell has no qualms about making later sex scenes visceral this film doesn t have immensely likable characters we sympathize with may but she too causes her daughter s suffering but i doubt kureishi intended to people his story with likable folk his point i believe was to unmask a family that s already cracking when something emotionally cataclysmic happens it s unflinching in its candor and ultimately unforgettable
wow a danish movie with this kind of content i mean the actors the story the pictures the efx everything was where it should be and a danish efx house producing those vfx wow this is like the nd or rd time a danish fx has produces visual effects in that quality spoiler ahead the twist with the ghostly children in the submarine was quite good but generally i did not feel the big chill which i would expect from a ghost movie end of spoiler but anyway this is a danish movie which i as a dane can be proud of the only bad about this is that it wasn t a danish director but a swedish
having not seen all the films released in i can t say that this is the best film of the year i can say that it is the best film i have seen all year most american films featuring black people either obsess over the american preoccupation with race relations or fall into the cliches of the inner city ghetto with every sterotype imaginable spouting ebonic phrased slang antwone fisher stands proudly alone in this regard race is irrelevant save for one fight that may or may not have been provoked by a racial slur antwone fisher s story is one that should find resonance with any empathic individual he is understatedly and thoughtfully portrayed by derek luke denzel washington while obviously using his star power to have the film made sticks to the background for the most part and allows the film to be the antwone fisher story at a time when bet and popular culture in general want to maintain the ghetoization of a large number of americans and canadians too you know this is a film that speaks to the humanity in all of us i just hope that the non black audience will go see this film for that humanity rather than avoiding it because they feel that there are no characters or actors in the movie whom they can identify with that would be a sad commentary on race relations in north america in and of itself
a friend of mine recommended this movie citing my vocal and inflective similarities with des howl the movie s main character i guess to an extent i can see that and perhaps a bit more i m not very sure whether or not that s flattering portrayal this is a pretty unique work the only movie to which this might have more than a glancing similarity would be true romance not for the content or the style of filming or for the pace of dialogue whale music is just so much more well relaxed but instead that they both represent modern love stories in general i m a big fan of canadian movies about music and musicians for example i highly recommend hard core logo and this film in particular it has an innocent charm des is not always the most likeably guy but there s something about him that draws a sterling sort of empathy
the cast is excellent the acting good the plot interesting the evolvement full of suspense but it is hard to cram all those elements into a film that is barely minutes long if more time was taken to develop the plot and subplots it would have a much better effect another minutes of substance would have made this a very good film rather then just a good one
i was delighted to finally see the release of amazing stories the first season on dvd i had forgotten just what a stellar cast of actors and directors worked on this series for the longest time the only way you got to see this remarkable series was with the vhs or episode collections or when sci fi would re run the episodes however when sci fi would host the re runs they generally stuck to the same episodes there were a few outstanding episodes in season one like the mission that they didn t repeat does anyone know exactly how long this series ran it says to at the top here at imdb but i thought it ran longer than two years if you loved the twilight zone night gallery and outer limits you will love this series and you will not be disappointed with your purchase
girlfight follows a project dwelling new york high school girl from a sense of futility into the world of amateur boxing where she finds self esteem purpose and much more although the film is not about boxing boxing is all about the film so much so you can almost smell the sweat technically and artistically a good shoot with an sense of honesty and reality about it girlfight is no chick flick and no rocky it is rather a very human drama which even viewers who don t know boxing will be able to connect with
the greatest games of kasparov or fischer can be a mess for a total rookie this is a great movie there is no special agency involved in the plot this is the clue this is a private plot built as a private enterprise this is a self destructive and a self organized plot as a conclusion the scenario described the perfect professional plot private self organized self destructive with no trace at the end anyone can be behind the plot a smart director with some money all can be done just by delegation the director must be just trigger if the normal viewer cannot see the essence of the plot in the explicit sequences of the movie a real plot has fewer chances to be discovered all the actors performances are well done with some special mention for gene hackman and mickey rooney
mad dog earle is back along with his sad sack moll marie and that fickle clubfoot velma so are babe and red doc and big mac and even the scenery chewing mutt pard the only thing missing is a good reason for remaking raoul walsh s high sierra years later without rethinking a line or a frame and doing so with talent noticeably a rung or two down the ladder from that in the original instead of walsh we get stuart heisler for humphrey bogart we get jack palance for ida lupino shelley winters and so on down through the credits the only change is that this time instead of black and white it s in warnercolor sadly there are those who would count this an improvement i died a thousand times may be unnecessary and inferior but at least it s not a travesty the story still works on its own stagy terms earle palance fresh out of the pen near chicago drives west to spearhead a big job masterminded by ailing kingpin lon chaney jr knocking over a post mountain resort en route he almost collides with a family of oakies when he s smitten with their granddaughter the smiting holds even when he discovers she s lame arriving at the cabins where the rest of gang holes up he finds amateurish hotheads at one another s throats as well as winters who throws herself at him as does the pooch biding time until they get a call from their inside man at the hotel palance to winter s chagrin offers to pay for an operation to cure the girl s deformity a gesture that backfires then the surgical strike against the resort turns into a bloodbath on the lam palance moves higher into the cold sierras it s an absorbing enough story competently executed that lacks the distinctiveness walsh and his cast brought to it in the year bogie with this role and that of sam spade in the maltese falcon became a star and one last heretical note those mountains do look gorgeous in color

i watched ice age in the movie theater and i liked the movie spite of the fact that ice age has many flaws and scientific errors like humans sabers dinosaurs and mammoths living at the same period and even the location of where the story passes looks north america but has some characteristics from iceland for example we can have fun even so unless you are very severe the planet is entering an ice age and many animals are immigrating to the south where is warmer sid is a stupid sloth that is left behind by his own family that can t stand him any longer walking in his way he meets manfred or how he calls manny a moody mammoth who does not care about extinction or immigration and is going to the north worried that he can easily be captured sid decides to follow manfred and in the middle of their journey they found a human mother with her baby the mother dies but manfred and sid decides to take him and return the baby for the humans diego one of the sabers decides to follow and help them to go to a shortcut to the human s camp what manfred and sid does not know is that diego is from a saber clan who hates humans and wants to kill the baby and also pretend to betray they both to make they become saber s food what will happen will depend of diego s behavior and conscience aka a era do gelo brazil
i can t say whether the post wwii british comedies produced at the ealing studios are an acquired taste or not but i am completely addicted and the man in the white suit is one of the best no need to go into the well known plot about the threat posed to both the textile industry and the textile unions by an indestructible dirt resistant fiber suffice it to say that the slings and arrows suffered by the naively idealistic sidney stratton in pursuing his polymer vision make for a comedic delight many of the well known faces from the world of british character actors the nervous cecil parker the suavely devious michael gough and the bluntly ruthless ernest thesinger put in wonderful performances guinness as always and forever is superb and joan greenwood is delectable as daphne just the way she enunciates the word daddy makes the entire movie worth seeing knudsen
i was blown away by the re imagined battlestar galactica a show that always kept me guessing and brought me to tears on more than one occasion a hardened sci fi fan i like to think i can pick out the good stuff from the bs and this was good stuff as such when i first heard about the prospect of a prequel series some months ago i got a sick feeling in my gut i was afraid that the formula that made battlestar so successful would be reused in caprica which wouldn t work at all bsg s story of a mournful ragged band of survivors trapped aboard decaying star ships and guided by prophetic vision and a sequence of pseudo miracles was perfectly complimented by extraordinary music and a better cast of actors caprica feels different where bsg takes place after the fall of a great civilization caprica portrays that civilization in it s cold and decadent heyday the overall vibe i got from caprica was similar to that of minority report minus excessive and counterproductive theatricality in true bsg form caprica has in it s first few hours of programming already tackled the issues of religious freedom racism the morality of playing god and the nature of the human soul the casting for caprica is also excellent each character is unique and deep from the obsessive and distant scientist turned entrepreneur to his troubled and willful daughter each actor and actress throws themselves into their respective roles music which was used so powerfully in bsg also plays a significant role in caprica battlestar s powerful rolling drums and mournful duduks served it s themes very well caprica uses a more orchestral sound which gives the show it s own feeling quite distinct from either of it s predecessors the new caprica is definitely it s own show pulling from the battlestar franchise only as much as it needs i look forward to the full series
spoiler this movie is based on the concept of what if of course mr destiny will be able to answer this question the main character goes through a bad day like many of us and asks this question chaos theory states a butterfly in china could have an effect on someone over here from a chain reaction the focus of this movie is based on one event during a baseball game this event sets into motion one s destiny just like ashton in the butterfly effect except mr destiny uses comedy over drama the results make a fresh somewhat original movie if one s philosophical are in tune with the butterfly effect one will likely enjoy mr destiny i give it a out of amazing for i have seen the first half of this movie times and finally watched the ending on tbs
yes i ll say before i start commenting this movie is incredibly underrated sharon stone is great in her role of catherine trammell as is morrissey as dr glass he is an analyst sent in to evaluate her after the death of a sports star glass is drawn into a seductive game that trammel uses to manipulate his mind the acting was good apart from thewlis stone really has a talent with this role she s slick naughty and seductive and doesn t look a day older than she did in the first she really impressed me like in casino morrisey was also good he showed much vunerablitity in a role that needed it thewlis however was lame he ruined his character and was over the top the whole way he really sucked overall this movie not as good the first but stone is a hoot to watch just ignore thewlis
the title of this movie doesn t make a lot of sense until you see it in operation because it s the sound that a retarded young man makes while he s operating his imaginary trolley which is what he does all day and he is just one of many odd characters in this surreal at times tragic tale of a group of slum dwellers in japan there are two drunks who trade wives there s a man with aspirations to be a architect and his young son who he sends out to beg for food there s a wise old man who seems to be the pillar of sanity within all that goes on around him and there s a businessman with some severe nervous tics that has a wife that treats him and everyone else like dirt there s no particular plot to this really it s a bunch of stories that drift back forth between each other sometimes funny sometimes tragic all in all i thought it worked pretty well i had been dying to see this for a long time just based on its description i was not in the least disappointed and i d definitely recommend this out of
husbands beware is a remake of the shemp classic brideless groom the film s new cooking scene at the beginning of the film is great the stooges are always funny when they cook however after the first few minutes of cooking footage we cut to original footage of brideless groom one thing i noticed about these to remakes are that they do fit with the new story they do an insert shot if the old story line doesn t match husbands beware does have a new ending but i won t give it away to those who want to be surprised out of stars
this film was shot on location in gerard gardens in liverpool and was the uk s answer to films such as blackboard jungle the film stands the test of time quite well with all the moral stories still or even more relevant today the film feature some fine performance from some notable british actors such as david mccallum stanley baker peter cushing and anne heywood baker plays a liverpool cop assigned to juvenile liaison duties with the premise that if you catch the kids at an early age they will end up being responsible adults notable cameos in the film include freddie starr fred fowell and melvyn hayes gloria tsai chin and michael chow play brother and sister they are real life brother and sister who are caught up in an arsonists web tsai chin is still acting and can be seen in the latest nicole kidman film the interpretor violent playground features a gun siege in a school so is unlikely to be shown on tv following similar events in scotland russia i lived in gerard gardens where the film was shot though was not born at the time and have fond memories of the area i have recently completed a documentary on gerard gardens which includes extracts from violent playground and a small uk film coast to coast which stars lenny henry and pete postlewaite the tenements were demolished in and the films go some way in keeping the memory alive there were some complaints from the residents when the film was released as the film portrayed the area in a bad light time has helped heal those wounds a little gem of a film i would recommend you seek this out
sometimes they get lucky and have a hit on their hands wayne s world the first one not the second but most often they have duds it s pat comes to mind rather quickly this time out it s tim meadows as the ladies man this movie falls somewhere in between a hit and a dud it was very funny for the first minutes but then as usually happens with snl skits it starts to slow down before finally ending long after it should have tim meadows is leon phelps a radio dj with a nightly show called the ladies man he answers any and all questions dealing with sex and relationships usually in the crudest way possible everything seems to ultimately come down to the butt after pushing the buttons of the station manager leon along with his producer julie karyn parsons gets fired and needs to find another job out of the random blue comes a letter from one of his ex ladies the letter offers him wealth and luxury for the rest of his life the only problem being that the letter isn t signed so leon needs to track down all the women he s been with to find the woman of his dreams but sometimes as billy dee williams says in the film the woman of your dreams is standing right in front of you there is also a sub plot about a bunch of guys who s wives girlfriends have all slept with leon and they want to first figure out who he is by a tattoo he has on a part of his anatomy then kill him leading this bunch of guys is surprise will ferrell from snl first off i thought the sub plot was rather lame the singing and dancing stuff was just completely worthless i usually like will ferrell but here he just never clicked for me and the rest of the guys were just schlubs who tagged along and in the end all decided that having their wives girlfriends cheat on them was in fact their fault so back to the main story the story basically centers around leon and sex so what it comes down to is if you don t like the character of leon you won t like the movie his voice his mannerisms his dialogue is what carries the movie i am not a big fan of tim meadows i never thought he was a particularly good actor on snl the only thing i ever really liked of his was his ladies man skits but the best thing about those is that they usually involved the guest host remember the one with cameron diaz and they were short for about minutes they were pretty funny and here for about minutes it s really funny what i thought was good about the character in the movie is that he stayed in character throughout he never wavered from his wanted to just get laid persona until right at the end where there was this transformation and the ever present speech to tie things up other than that it was pretty good at keeping leon as leon and not changing him into something less crude than he was there isn t a lot of substance to this movie if you couldn t guess but like i said earlier the beginning of the movie i found to be very funny some real laugh out loud moments all revolving around sex and his crudeness the problem of course with this movie and most other snl spin offs is that these are characters that are only supposed to be shown for a few minutes at a time stretching the concept into minutes is very difficult that difficulty is obviously why they needed the sub plot because without it this movie would have been a little under an hour when it was good it was good but when it wasn t good it got to be boring so overall the ladies man wasn t as bad as other snl films but it wasn t as good as others it had some funny moments the first minutes was pretty good but the rest of it dragged on there was an unnecessary sub plot whose only purpose was to lengthen the film the bottom line is if you like tim meadows and his leon phelps character you ll be able to watch the film if he annoys you don t even bother going unless you just want to see tiffani theissen in some nice revealing clothing
this documentary was nominated for an oscar and it s easy to see why even years later it is quite an impressive piece of work why it isn t in print is a mystery that only disney can explain good use of live footage and animation in tandem this used to run as part of vault disney every few months or so but i haven t seen it listed in quite a while sigh most recommended
perhaps i would have liked this film more if i wasn t so attached to the characters in henry fool to those who ve never seen henry fool i wouldn t worry as hartley jokingly said in his introduction to the film at tiff the film has lots of exposition and explanations this film is very heavy in plot which keeps the film moving there are many humorous moments and the film certainly has hartley s trademark humour and rhythm of dialogue over all a technically well made film and sure to satisfy new fans of hartley who are just beginning explore his work as for the older fans who loved his earlier works like trust and amateur this film could go either way i have mixed feelings about the film and hartley s later films in general what hartley does best is setting his stories in small situations focusing on the intimate and idiosyncratic ways in which his characters interact with each other since his late s and onward his films have widened in scope in terms of subject matter mass media in no such thing religion in the book of life and now terrorism in fay grim i don t know if hartley s talents are suited to such big subject matter or if he s able to do it justice strangely enough the film can still be reduced to intimate relationships a simple love story about a woman who goes to seek out the husband she loves the only problem is i ve seen henry fool and everyone seems incredibly out of character in this film you can tell this film was written long after henry fool was finished without any intention of a sequel somehow the terrorist plot feels conveniently tacked on through the use of henry s books of confessions as a macguffin in the hitchcockian sense fay s motivations for finding henry seemed motivated purely by the needs of the plot rather than what being faithful to who fay was as person in henry fool i guess i m slightly disappointed in the film because it s not true to the characters in the henry fool and it doesn t exactly work as a straight ahead thriller there s too much irony and wryness in hartley s approach to such as big topic as terrorism it somehow works and doesn t work at the same time all i could say you would either love or hate the film depending on your take on hartley s work and how well you know hartley s work fans of henry fool be severely warned for a disappointment for the rest welcome to the world of hal hartley and enjoy the ride
reign over me adam sandler don cheadle jada pinkett smith liv tyler saffron burrows donald sutherland robert klein melinda dillon mike binder jonathan banks rae allen paula newsome at times affecting and at times middling dramedy about a thoroughly depressed man who lost his family on sandler in his best role since punch drunk love who winds up re united with his old college roommate and friend cheadle continuing to do impressive work with every role to date a well to do dentist who seems to have it all family wealth happiness but really sees an ally in freedom with his troubled friend s own personal life offerings written and directed by binder who co stars as sandler s former best friend and acting accountant with equal parts humor and genuine heartache the film works best when the two stars share the screen until the last act falls into an almost movie of the week treacle with to tidy a solution to the matters at hand
though i really didn t feel anything for lance s character and felt his wife could have done much better with anyone else it could have been a much stronger movie if they had spent more time on character development perhaps with lance i would have liked it better however i have to completely agree with doyleluver when they said and to quote glenn quinn s character ben i m the star here in it that s right i m the talented one if you watch the movie just watch him even when he s in the background just his facial expressions all in the eyes you know for sure what motivates ben exactly how he feels about comments even if it s a quick look behind a character s back great acting in a fair film
the undoubted highlight of this movie is peter o toole s performance in turn wildly comical and terribly terribly tragic does anybody do it better than o toole i don t think so what a great face that man has the story is an odd one and quite disturbing and emotionally intense in parts especially toward the end but it is also oddly touching and does succeed on many levels however i felt the film basically revolved around peter o toole s luminous performance and i m sure i wouldn t have enjoyed it even half as much if he hadn t been in it
anyone who thinks anime is nothing but sex and violence will be silenced forever after watching this movie this is a fine movie that tells about tetsuro s quest to avenge his mother s death but also grows up in the process the journey on the train sort of represents tetsuro s journey from boyhood to manhood the music and visual styles of the movie are a bit dated you can tell it s a s movie and the animation is only slightly better than your average star blazers episode but the story and the characters are so strong it really doesn t matter a must see for any animation fan

if the very thought of arthur askey twists your guts don t worry you can still watch and love the ghost train like the equally marvellous back room boy it is a film that is simply too damn good to be sunk by a single performance even that of the lead actor personally i love askey perhaps it s because i go into his world rather than unreasonably expecting him to come into mine which is a mistake too many people make the ghost train is so intensely atmospheric that you couldn t conceivably watch it without being amazed at the deep dark world it transports you to it is immersive in a way that few cheap and cheerful flag wavers managed to be during the desperate early s and it s a film that i would imagine few people have ever watched just the once the cast are without exception extraordinarily good perhaps linden travers lays it on a bit thick but against the backdrop of a lonely railway station in wartime she could hardly play a nutter and not stand out the sad passing of the lovely carole lynne earlier this year broke the last link we had with this incredible film and now it really is in the past but waiting patiently for us to press play
i just finished watching this film and found it very enjoyable it is a quiet little film that doesn t overwhelm you with special effects or big performances it simply takes you into the lives of the people living in a small hamlet in the backwoods of north carolina henry thomas gives a good performance as raymond toker a young loner who finds a baby abandoned in the woods toker s search for the baby s parents takes him on a journey that will have a profound impact on his life david srathairn plays truman lester a slimy conman with an ulterior motive and david plays the bad guy to perfection there is much more to this film than first meets the eye filmed on location in north carolina and with a wonderful sound track of traditional music it is worth watching
spoilers spoilers this movie the divers is really interesting all i roughly knew about it was that it would involve nazi history underwater scenes and everybody would be speaking danish but i decided to check it out for one reason the fact that the story evolves around a sunken wwii german submarine i ve got a fetish for german subs especially wrecks that can be dived upon so i was a bit sceptical about the danish part but reasoned that the sub could weigh up that part knowing that nordic films aren t always that good and not sure of the budget size i was to say the least very sceptical upon viewing i was surprised i had some thoughts on the actors being inadequate seeing how some are very young the two main actors in particular this was not an issue they both perform very well as do the other actors who mostly consist of people in their s and beyond this makes for some interesting interaction between young and old not often seen on the screen not unique in anyway but somewhat rare and it s all good as for the danish language it is nearly impossible to understand but this was no problem it had subtitles another issue was the submarine itself i suspected there would be interior shots as well as underwater exterior shots of the submarine having decided their budget was slim i thought this could turn out adequate at the best and down right awful at it s worst again i was surprised the exterior scenes of the wreck are beautiful and the interior scenes are very realistic having a fetish for german subs i knew what the sub should look like especially inside and was not let down the team has done some serious research it s all good i suspect more people than myself will watch this movie just to see some sub wreck scenes so i feel i must issue a warning the submarine in the movie is not an actual model that existed during the war it s a special purpose sub but to give you a hint of what to expect it s a crossing between a type vii type ix and a japanese transport sub similar to i it s god a good design and makes a nice wreck the setting is on a danish island or peninsula i can t remember it s summertime and two brothers travel to their grandfather to celebrate the coming of summer as they do every year their grandfather is a mariner of sorts the cinematography is quite nice a lot of pretty summer scenes at the island docks some newfound teenage love nice diving weather and a general feeling of perfect once again it s all good plot wise the island gets some visitors of the suspect kind a gathering of men hire one of the boats an old minesweeper and it s crew one of the visitors a man in his s has the german eagle and swastika tattooed on his back the island s senior citizens all remember when a german u boat was sunk towards the end of world war ii and ever since then there have been rumors of nazi gold in the depths the grandfather was one of the young men who searched for the sunken u boat shortly after german bodies started floating ashore back in no submarine was ever found what to expectkey elements are nazi experiments nazi history treasure hunting secrecy competition teen love conspiracy and a surprise warning spoiler i had not expected some elements of the supernatural to appear in this movie and it caught me off guard not being a big fan of supernatural events it nevertheless fitted well into the story and poses no problem it s not like from dusk til dawn where everybody turns into vampires towards the end this is a bit more subtle overall really good movie i gave it an some due to the fact that it isn t a hollywood movie with unlimited resources i later learned that it had a fair budget and that some of the actors were seasoned danish veterans but even if this had been a hollywood production i would give it a or definately worth your while yes a child s story in a way but then again a mature tale it has a lot of suspense and a grand aura of adventure which i found very appealing and again the cinematography is really nice medusa
director douglas sirk scores again with this the grandaddy of all dysfunctional family films this lush trashy saga is a masterpiece beautifully combining all of the elements of sirk s soapers and strategically placing them all into one movie written on the wind very obviously influenced the s tv series dallas and dynasty as this is basically a feature length version of those later nighttime soaps lauren bacall wonderfully and subtly plays lucy moore a new york city secretary who marries oil baron kyle hadley robert stack unbeknownst to both of them mitch wayne rock hudson is also in love with the quiet but sexy secretary they all go back to kyle s family s mansion in texas where we meet his white trash slut of a sister marylee dorothy malone in an oscar winning turn yipee the sparks begin to fly from the romances to the catfights this is a campy trip not only does mitch have to fight the feelings he has for his best friend s wife but marylee tries to sleep with everybody since she can t have her one true love who is mitch topping it all off kyle learns he s impotent but somehow lucy ends up pregnant this is pure soap and pure melodramatic entertainment how can you not love it this film signals one of universal s most popular films and one of director sirk s best works some of the dialogue is absolutely sizzling and visual metaphors are thrown in every which way the theme of wind throughout is great the cast is great although bacall is completely underused despite receiving top billing behind hudson stack s oscar loss reportedly devastated him he considered this his finest performance and apparently was none too pleased to lose out and he did turn out a fabulous performance as the whimpering alcoholic what a stunning movie this film proves what i ve been thinking for ages sirk is the master of classic melodrama where s his oscar
this story is a familiar one in the long running tom and jerry cartoons especially in the s the only difference being that two cats instead of one are threatened to be evicted if they don t catch the mouse jerry tom has an unnamed buddy butch living in the house with him so this really upsets mammy two shoes who can t believe that they have a mouse despite two cats in the house anyway the one who catches jerry can stay while the other gets the boot so the competition is on even though it s familiar territory i still enjoyed this because the cartoon had enough original sight gags to make entertaining you not only had the cats competing against each but jerry in the equation as well so there were enough good gags to definitely recommend if you are a tom jerry fan
scott bartlett s offon is nine minutes of pure craziness it is a full frontal assault of psychedelic pulsating epilepsy inducing flashing lights and colours and the first true merging of film and video in avante garde cinema there s no story to speak of but bartlett uses images of nature particularly the human face and form to provoke a sequence of emotional reactions integrating these biological phenomena into the highly industrial form of modern technology in a sense the film represents the merging of humanity into his tools his machinery his technology this theme connects loosely with the subplot of hal in stanley kubrick s a space odyssey and indeed bartlett s opening sequence of images flashing colours before a close up human eye recalls dave bowman s journey through the stargate the visuals are richly coloured a confronting blend of sharp vivid photography and increasingly grainy video as though we re sitting too close to a television screen as a matter of fact the end product was recorded from a tv monitor there appears to be some confusion about the film s release date imdb lists the film as a release but both the national film registry and the national film preservation foundation give as the correct year perhaps this disparity reflects the time between the film s completion and its first public screening either way the visuals are distinctly ahead of their time occasionally reminiscent of a s music video and some brisk techno music wouldn t have gone amiss either offon captures grainy fragmented images presenting life from the warped perspective of a computer processing too much information i had a thought and please don t laugh at this free thinking interpretation that an extraterrestrial civilisation capturing earth s television signals might very well receive such a disjointed alien documentation of human life a bizarre montage of only vaguely familiar imagery that couldn t possibly make any coherent sense perhaps this is where mankind with all his technology is eventually heading towards an irreversible merging of film and video of purity and artificiality
billed as takashi miike s first family film by people who haven t seen zebraman presumably yokai daisenso takes things even further in the direction of family friendliness diluting the darkness and cynicism to create a grand fantasy fairy tale a young boy is chosen by fate to save the world from monsters and horrors of which they remain largely unaware the film is evidently bigger budget than anything else miike has done with lots of cgi to create fantasy world populated by odd creatures the yokai perhaps the lack of extreme content is a consequence of more nervous investors but i think it s probably just that he wanted to do something different he s really never been a one trick pony but often gets accused of it perhaps yokai is designed to silence those critics regardless it s a great project for miike to channel his boundless imagination and invention into there s a very cartoonish feel to the production evoking thoughts of miyazaki in places the yokai are based on an old series of comics that were in turned based on japanese folk tales which certainly influenced miyazaki as well particularly spirited away it must remembered that miike has nothing like the budget of a harry potter film to work with so the special effects aren t going to be seamless hollywood style work some blue screening is especially obvious some of the special effects are great though with some very well animated creatures a mix of cg stop motion and puppetry i think the little sock puppet that follows the hero around for much of the film was meant to look really cheap and is all the cuter for it the young lad who plays the hero of the film does a really good job it s so hard to find a pre teen who actually understands the concept of acting but year old ryunosuke kamiki is a genuine talent i see he did voices in the last miyazaki films chiaki kuriyama is delicious as the villainess of the piece though mai takahashi made an even greater impression as the pixie eared river princess yum yum those looking for another violent perverted gangster film aren t going to find what they re looking for in yokai but if you re a fan of miike because of his imagination and wit there s plenty to satisfy here and it has the added bonus that you can happily put it on whatever company you ve got
the wonderfully urbane ronald coleman is show cased here as in few other of his films he is literally in every scene and this comical movie remains fresh because of him not in spite of him he is handsome witty and very clever here as he remains a step ahead of his wandering lovely wife played perfectly by anna lee the movie is based on a french play and brings all the best qualities of that farce most of the supporting cast is well known at least by face if not name and are absolutely perfect for this very funny film the fantastic mr coleman is a combination of sean connery and clark gable as he stays a step ahead of the other characters his multi talents can be further appreciated in the classic lost horizon which every film buff must see
the only show i have watched since why did they discontinue it it was the only show that captured the essence of hawaii and made you feel like you are a part of it all the least they should do is release it on dvd i checked out similar shows but nothing has come close the cast had incredible chemistry and i looked forward to each episode with much anticipation they made a big mistake by pulling that show if anyone has any info regarding where i can obtain a dvd of north shore please post a few lines here thanks aloha
no not really but this is a very good film indeed and is sadly a forgotten gem black and white suits the film straight forward formula a guy had the plague and the authorities have to track down everyone he came in contact with before they die very well directed and the acting is great richard widmark as the male lead is good but is completely over shadowed in the acting stakes by paul douglas as the police captain and jack palance never better than this and zero mostel as the baddies sadly palance went on to play similar characters in some really second rate gangster or war movies
the movie is absolutely silly but were you expecting a high brow intellectual film based on a comic called slam dunk really jay chou s acting isn t exactly the most moving thing i ve ever seen but i certainly enjoyed the movie was it somewhere near the level of awesome that someone like jet li or stephen chow can produce no not really was it thoroughly entertaining if you re just taking it at surface value absolutely it s a movie about some chinese eye candy idols and musicians who can play basketball at an unreal level of expertise there s an evil triad style dude and a wacky scheming guy who gets jay chou involved in all of this a love interest it s formulaic but really suspend disbelief for a while come on it s called kung fu dunk what do you really think you signed on for do yourself a favor if you watch it i found myself a copy with some engrish subtitles that made the movie nigh unintelligible conversation wise but we got a great laugh out of it they would appear to be extremely fixated on jerusalem and the numbers i laughed i cried i hurled i d watch it again especially for that fight scene in the bar well choreographed and well shot i especially enjoy the plexiglass lit pool table i d love to play on one of those slick enough for me but i dig on trash cinema
for a long time the menagerie was my favorite star trek episode though in recent years it has been eclipsed by city on the edge of forever what i used to prefer about menagerie was that it s more hard core star trek with this fascinating back story to the then current trek storyline i still think it s fairly ingenious the way gene roddenberry incorporated the original pilot into a two part episode though the new part of the story is largely an excuse for kirk and a few others and us to watch the pilot the idea of spock being court martialed is a clever one you can poke holes in the plot if you want for instance given the talosians mind control abilities and captain pike s condition why is it even necessary to physically bring pike back to their planet and there are other confusing questions about pike and commodore mendez best to not think too hard about the details and just enjoy st s only two parter
well this movie was probobly one of the funniest scary movie i have ever seen the effects are so bad you just have to laugh and the acting well lets say its no mel gibson but gary browning who plays an police officer is so damn bad he becomes good i dont know how but he him self makes this movie a you must see it if your in to horror slash movies cause its bloody and funny at the same time killer movie
in a way this film reminded me of jumping jack flash remember whoopi goldberg at the shredding machine whoopi zonked out tranquilizers whoopi as blind lemon and imitating mick jagger great moments captured on film for sure but the movie still kind of sucks right that s how i feel about rich in love a man hears his wife sing for the first time post coital teenagers talk about the nature of love albert finney eats ice cream out of bucket and in another scene has a lovely waking moment regarding his absent wife alfre woodard adds another colorful character to her acting wardrobe but there s only the whisper of a plot here and you can t wait for it to get moving only when ex go gos charlotte caffey s the graces revs up a great pop song does the picture wake up and then it s over this picture is the equivalent of a lazy summer s day in the deep american south
we as a family were so delighted with the last of the blonde bombshells we purchased a copy for our home video library the acting is a and the cast contains many favorite actors and singers the theme is unusual and the script well written the music songs are timeless and takes us back to our young days when we sang the songs at the top of our voices to outline the story here would spoil the plot as it is really nice to sit back and enjoy the story as it unfolds full marks to this most enjoyable and uplifting production and we heartily recommend it to anyone who is looking for a belly laugh and lots of music
it is no surprise that writer director michael powell considered a matter of life and death his and emeric pressburger s spellbinding fantasy from to be his favourite of their films together released during the aftermath of world war this colourful romantic adventure would have provided just the tonic for a traumatised recovering nation in need of a good uplift following a string of other patriotic war films the archers made this one their quirkiest skittish and most patriotic of the lot quintessentially british for upholding british heritage shakespeare beer fair play good manners it is also visibly americanised in its baroque compositions technical inventiveness and a fine multi ethnic cast oddly echoing another classic it s a wonderful life amolad opens on a grand firmament with one of those jolly voice overs preaching about the earth and the heavens and what a big wonderful world we live in it then cuts to the inside of a british cockpit badly hit up in flames and with the co pilot already dead it sounds misconceived but the connection is soon made lucid with the events that follow clocking in at nearly minutes the rapid fire exchange between british pilot peter david niven and american radio contact june kim hunter is breathtaking in its intimacy resigned to dying peter nevertheless exhausts plenty of vigour charm and outpouring confessions and his warm affiliation with june closes with a mutual exchange of i love you keeping with the magic of the moment peter by oversight of his conductor whose job it was to transport him to the other world escapes death and finds himself stranded on a beach he later encounters june riding a bicycle and instantly matches the body with the voice but realising their error the high court want peter sent back and order the french conductor maurice goring down to earth to retrieve him but peter is adamant to live because of june and the conductor s mistake and wilfully guards his corner peter s fate ultimately lies with the heavenly court and american prosecutor raymond massey whose jury consists of several deceased war heroes and posh british delegates the surreal trial which dissolves from b w back into rich technicolor once the verdict is announced may well be a dream but the final shot in the hospital validates the predictable outcome the abstract frame filling stairway to heaven the american title of the film is used twice the first time in b w when it elevates peter and his enigmatic french guardian upwards crossing giant statues of peter s potential attorneys for the trial including abraham lincoln and plato the second time the softly lit colour stairway provides the setting for what is an iconic image in cinema peter and june frozen side by side their marvelled eyes fixed forward in the frame their fate sealed the unlikely affection shared between peter and june never turns mushy or verbose it s treated with nobility and the perception that the couple are already suitable enough to be married and simply need to convince people of their love so it can keep them together the french conductor who can freeze time and people s bodies obtrudes many of their key moments together lecturing peter about history and among his mischievous tricks pinching peter s top game tricks book and his coffee cup as visually inspired as other powell pressburger collaborations this was the first time they combined colour with b w the latter having a cheerful quality when used for the heaven scenes and both are equally captivating the outstanding script more than matches the imaginative set design with dialogue that sounds so immediate that is doesn t feel like it was written or performed for the screen amusing and witty powell pressburger s writing deserves equal acclamation with their forte for colour and composition made in a matter of life and death is one of those films that defies it age looking fresh and inventive even in this age where cgi would vamp up its artificial effects probably stripping them of their emotional wonder other jarring changes would include the need for reduced average seconds for cutting and the inevitable plea to shorten dialogue so it can preserve the low attention spans of most audiences powell weaves a spell that subconsciously absorbs the viewer from the first frame giving him freedom to experiment with images without betraying the logical development of peter s predicament
notice that all those that did not like and enjoy this film commented that it was not as good as the book or that it differed from the book i don t understand this type of criticism books and films are different media while books have hours and hours to develop characters and story lines films have about minutes yet the film has the advantage of stimulating several senses visual audio as well as the imagination i don t care if a film is as good as or in fact has any resemblance to the book on which it is based who cares i judge it for what it is this tv movie was charming an old and oft seen story prone to clich it could easily have been embarrassing however riffen and reeves pull it off one reviewer found riffen far to old i would never have guessed she was when she made this film it is to her credit as an actress that she played a year old amazingly well i also think it is about the best thing reeves ever did the story could have been stronger and i agree the screen play could have used tightening nonetheless it is well worth watching clearly not a powerful love story but rather a charming romance which will leave you satisfied that love is a strong emotion and good overcomes evil and it is nice to see a love story without the obligatory f word the naked buttocks or hours of spit swapping kissing lastly the musical score is excellent
human tornado is in many ways a better film than it s predecessor the director knew what he had to work with and catered towards rudy ray moore s limitations as an actor it s a fun movie that s more technically sound and acted the performers don t take themselves too seriously and it seems that this time around everyone is on the joke and goes with the flow rudy ray moore seems more relaxed in front of the camera and not as stiff like he was in dolemite i enjoyed the film very much and i highly recommend it just like his first film it s catered towards a certain audience i highly doubt that mr moore was trying to broaden his audience at this point in his career check it out highjly recommended
probably my all time favorite movie a story of selflessness sacrifice and dedication to a noble cause but it s not preachy or boring it just never gets old despite my having seen it some or more times in the last years paul lukas performance brings tears to my eyes and bette davis in one of her very few truly sympathetic roles is a delight the kids are as grandma says more like dressed up midgets than children but that only makes them more fun to watch and the mother s slow awakening to what s happening in the world and under her own roof is believable and startling if i had a dozen thumbs they d all be up for this movie
one of the less widely lauded of recent asian period action affairs gojoe is an at first slow and often curious but overall pretty terrific offering exciting layered and beautiful i m sad to say i know virtually nothing of the buddhist philosophy or japanese history and legend that surrounds this film so its deeper meanings are lost on me but even without contextual knowledge this is still rich fare taking a traditional fantasy structure into a impactful higher plane the story is of benkei a warrior monk and perhaps demon who seeks enlightenment by destroying the demon of gojoe bridge prince shanao himself a mortal seeker after his own higher plane but this time the power of demons thus the film becomes a matter of illusions and in benkei s case indecision a conflict in which the real goal is self knowledge for benkei to come to terms with his true nature and for prince shanao to come face to face with the nature of what he seeks to become benkei is even more hampered here by the fact that his dark nature makes him fundamentally at odds with the world even when not in open conflict he is never at ease director sogo ishii handles this one as an epic with measured pace camera work always stylish and often frenzied without neglecting the need for more sedate moments to let the location sink in there is also great use of lighting and fog to give an ethereal atmosphere there is an air of fantasy to much of the film but outside of the overtly supernatural moments it is a down and dirty fantasy with more period fell than flights of fancy the cinematography of makoto watanbe is important here vivid and detailed a richly evocative affair actingwise daisuke ryu is dignified and powerful with a mysterious savagery as benkei while tadanobu asano has a driven cold arrogance as prince shanao of the leads masatoshi nagase rounds things out as an ordinary man smart and cynical but still unaware of just exactly what the stakes are the film all fits together well it is however a touch flabby at times it begins slowly some shots are a little drawn out and the epic fight scenes at times go on longer than strictly necessary as for the fighting it is filmed frenetic rather than for actual moves it has artistic impact but may disappoint regular action fans often obscured by objects flashing blades and fast moving individuals whirling with deadly force through their adversaries are the order of the day it is invigorating to watch but in the end i could have done with a little more traditionalism there is some unfortunate cgi bloodshed as well it somewhat works in the context but is still distracting overall though i found this to be a pretty great film its not one for regular action fans or swordplay enthusiasts seeking another azumi rather a deeper and more mystical beast its ending in particular will not go down well with fans of the more generic wing of such fare but as for myself it really hit the spot and for those more adventurously inclined it might do so too well recommended at any rate
zane and beringer will keep you on the edge of your seats i don t typically go for military war movies but this was worth my time it was serious but it was also humorous beringer s character proved to be heroic and honest no matter what you know that he s got your back zane s character developed throughout the film he wasn t just a suit he definitely proved that he could be a hero and handle a gun the ending through me a little though it didn t really go with the action throughout the film but i m glad that i saw it nonetheless it s worth checking out
cry freedom is an excellent primer for those wanting an overview of apartheid s cruelty in just a couple of hours famed director richard attenborough gandhi is certainly no stranger to the genre and the collaboration of the real life mr and mrs woods the main white characters in their book and in this film lends further authenticity to cry freedom the video now in release actually runs a little over and a half hours since minutes of extra footage was inserted to make it a two part tv miniseries after the film s initial theatrical release while the added length serves to heighten the film s forgivable flaws uneven character development and blanket stereotyping in particular another possible flaw the insistence on the white characters fate over that of the african ones may work out as a strength viewing crying freedom as a politically and historically educational film as i think it should over its artistic merits the story is one which black africans know only too well though the younger generation may now need to see it on film for full impact it is the whites who have always been the film s and the book s target audience hopefully driving them to change now twelve years after the movie s production cry freedom is in many ways a more interesting film to watch almost ten years after black majority rule has been at least theorically in place s cry freedom s ideals remain by and large unrealized it therefore remains as imperative as ever for white south africans particularly the younger ones who have only heard of these actions to see it and absorb the film s messages in total contrast to american slavery and the jewish holocaust s exposure south africans struggles have been told by a mere two or three stories cry freedom cry the beloved country ok count it twice if you include the remake and sarafina did i miss one all three dramas also clumsily feature american and british actors in both the white and black roles not one south african actor has played a major role white coloured indian or black and yes i did miss another international south african drama mandela and deklerk though this also highly recommended biopic was released after black majority rule was instituted mandela was played by a black american sidney poitier who also starred in the original s a themed cry the beloved country while the afrikaner deklerk was played by a bald very british michael caine a good performance if you can dismiss that the very essence of afrikanerdom is vehement anti british feelings until local sabc tv and african films start dealing with their own legacy cry freedom is about as authentic as you ll get as villified as the whites particularly the afrikaners are portrayed in the film any observant non casual visitor to south africa even now in not to mention when cry freedom takes place will generally find white s attitudes towards blacks restrained even understated looking at cry freedom in hindsight it is amazing that reconciliation can take place at all and it is but cry freedom at time shows not much has really changed in many people s minds yet and that the black africans goal to freedom and reconciliation is still ongoing this is why if you re a novice to the situation cry freedom is your best introduction
say what you want about andy milligan but if his family was even as deranged as the one in this film well then i guess he could have turned out worse unfortunately the video print of this film contains sex scene inserts originally shot by the distributor to boost the picture s box office appeal several times during the film milligan s ugly camerawork and silent film music abruptly ends and suddenly good looking stand ins for milligan s homely actors take over and start doing it to psychedelic s guitar rock it s pretty easy to fast forward through if you re trying to pay attention to milligan s original film which unfortunately is missing quite a bit of action that was cut to make room for the added sex scenes what remains however is still compelling stuff i don t think i ve ever seen a more hateful mother in any film before
paul verhoeven s predecessor to his breakout hit basic instinct is a stylish and shocking neo noir thriller verhoeven has become known for making somewhat sleazy trash films both in his native holland and in america and this film is one of the reasons why the fourth man follows the strange story of gerard reve played by jeroen krabb a gay alcoholic and slightly mad writer who goes to vlissingen to give a talk on the stories he writes while there he meets the seductive christine halsslag ren e soutendijk who takes him back to her house where he discovers a handsome picture of one of her lovers and proclaims that he will meet him even if it kills him paul verhoeven twists the truth many times in this film and that ensures that you never quite know where you are with it many of the occurrences in the fourth man could be what they appear to be but they could easily be interpreted as something else entirely and this keeps the audience on the edge of their seats for the duration and also makes the film work as this narrative is what it thrives on paul verhoeven is not a filmmaker that feels he has to restrain himself and that is one of things i like best about him this film features a very shocking scene that made me feel ill for hours afterwards and that doesn t happen very often i wont spoil it because it needs the surprise element to work but you ll see what i mean when you see the film make sure you get the uncut version there is also a number of other macabre scenes that are less shocking than the one i ve mentioned but are lovely nonetheless a man gets eaten by lions another one has a pipe sent through his skull a boat is smashed in half lovely the acting in the fourth man isn t anything to write home about but it s solid throughout jeroen krabb holds the audience s attention and looks the part as the drunken writer it is ren e soutendijk that impresses the most though as the femme fatale at the centre of the tale her performance is what sharon stone would imitate nine years later with basic instinct but the original fatale did it best paul verhoeven s direction is solid throughout as he directs our attention through numerous points of view all of which help to create the mystery of the story verhoeven has gone on to make some rubbish but he obviously has talent and it s a shame that he doesn t put it to better use of all the verhoeven films i ve seen this is the best and although it might be difficult to come across trust me it s worth the effort
remember h g wells the invisible man well here s another movie like it only more extreme hollow man is like no one story about invisibility as a weapon of choice kevin bacon plays sebastian caine a scientific genius who goes out into the world of invisibility and making it useful for military purposes at first making the serum was the easy part making the person come back was not most of the first tries ended up unstable until one night when he perfected the formula and who else but caine would be the lab rat the gorilla was the first and almost died so when he came to it was a close one so when the did caine he decided to use it for fun then when he got tired of being not seen the team tried their best to bring him back to the world of the flesh however the visibility formula happens to not work the way it should and caine would delve into madness so he ends up being one mad invisible killer it would be best to just get out of town instead of taking the lives of people that are close to you i would care less about the ones who did you wrong great movie plenty of fun out of stars
before seeing this i was merely expecting another mediocre soft core copy of the much imitated emmanuelle series starring sylvia kristel it was really surprising how good this one turned out to be it actually has a story and it is very romantic indeed what makes yellow emanuelle so good is it s leading heroine the beautiful and exotic chai lee she plays her character emy wong so sweetly that the viewer just has to feel something for her when her dreams crash down around her emy wong is a much respected doctor statuesque with a regal quality she comes from an important old family where ancient customs are still practiced emy will remain a virgin until she is married to a man she has never met the beautiful doctor seems ok with this arranged marriage it is simply how it is done in her world however she does not plan on meeting and falling in love with the british pilot who ends up under her care in the hospital where she works emy decides to do away with custom and she gives herself to her western man but only after a very long courtship as doctor wong is anything but an easy woman her pilot george is a good guy and promises to marry emy so that she doesn t lose her respectability and place in her rigid society neither one counts on a third party one ilona staller who destroys their relationship through a series of vicious games emy is made to believe that she has been abandoned by her man that he only played a game with her in order to sleep with her her place in society is gone she has been debased the film takes a surprisingly dramatic and depressing turn as this proud elegant woman gives up her career as well as a sweet relationship with her caring father and succumbs to a life of drinking and prostitution i was surprised to find myself so engrossed in this operatically tragic tale i was on the edge of my seat when george blows back into town and unknowingly walks into a hotel where his beautiful emy is working as a prostitute classic drama i imagine many viewers were a bit frustrated by all this drama one would expect lots of sex and nudity here but there is not much and when there is it is totally non exploitative and very artsy and soft core if you are a fan of the first emmanuelle with sylvia kristel than you most likely will appreciate this lesser known classic i was especially impressed by the extra attention to details the whole segment where emy takes george to her fathers house on the island is really nice her father shows george and the viewer his impressive collection of bonzai trees he has a whole miniature forest built out of these amazing trees totally unexpected after catching it on late night cable tv years ago i spent much time searching the internet for a copy of the film when i finally got it i found that the video version was longer more sex no more melodrama for the dvd release there is a subplot about george suddenly keeling over with some unknown deadly disease i actually preferred the cable version better i am glad that this rare gem has been released finally on dvd i must also mention the beautiful cinematography and the bizarre and catchy s soundtrack while watching this one you just get the feeling that you are watching something very rare and quite special i recommend it to thoughtful viewers who don t need sex and violence to maintain their interest
i am not going to lie this is a great movie i saw it about months ago at my local theatre i saw it a second time and i was somewhat bored in the slow scenes sid the sloth is not all that flattering but diego a mountain lion i think is really good in the movie the animation is outstanding and the story has a touching ending it is worth taking kids and under to but teens would probably find it a tad bit boring also the uniqueness in the characters is so interesting like i said it is a pretty good movie but i would rate toy story or shrek higher
have just finished watching this film which upset me greatly have also been to south africa twice around the time this film is set it is certainly hard hitting and the opening scenes tend to set the scene the slow but steady increase of pace hardly allows a break and there are certainly few light moments will never be able to view nigel hawthorne the same again he came across as a very twisted individual and i found myself disliking him more each time he appeared totally agree with steve thomp s articulate and well thought out comments
this movie is a little unusual in that it s got a very slim plot and the movie itself is done at a very slow and leisurely pace while this makes it pretty different from the average grant film it is still highly watchable and entertaining it s sort of like someone said let s just follow cary around and watch as he gets perturbed at all the little problems that come up when you are having a house rehabbed considering what a fun actor he is in the film and the great support he gets from myrna loy and melvin douglas the film works very well while the film has pretty modest pretensions it makes the most of the material it s a great film for cary grant fans or for the whole family
after growing up in the gritty streets of detroit mi and having friends who traveled to new york balls i fell into the lifestyle of being a house member i joined the house of theieves we adapted the same rules as most houses but we were professional crooks that would boost and commit credit card fraud to obtain the fabulous jewels and clothes we desired i even learned how to profess the making of checks and driver s license and cash them in over seventeen states until a jealous queen called the secret service on me and i went to federal prison but i learned a lot from these queens in this movie and i highly recommend you watch it yourself you can even read about how i grew up in the houses here in detroit and the criminal activity we indulged in my book identity schemes is available on sale at amazon dot com or at identity schemes dot com but trust me it is a lot better than paris is burning because its a make
i ll keep it short and brief the people who wrote the story lines for this show are genius the actors are just perfect for the roles they play cj s character is legendary and they have so much chemistry on screen which makes it what it is a very successful comedy when i saw first saw the new episodes which is probably going back just over months i wondered what had happened to paul i was gutted to find out that he had died when i browsed google he was so funny and played his character to perfection an over protective dad who likes to keep his daughters out of the limelight and away from boys the comedy i think has gone from strength to strength even without paul in it plus i think most people would enjoy this watching it
this film is hilarious original beautifully directed i have become a big bad swim groupie tracking it to film festivals whenever wherever i can i ve seen it about half a dozen times now each time enthusiastic audience response has confirmed my feeling that this is one of the best films to come out in years at nearly every festival it has screened it has either sold out or won the audience favorite award it s clear that people love this film even clearer why they do the cinematography is superb the characterization acting brilliant the ending fantastic the direction filled with compassion wisdom the art of perfect timing it s hard to believe this is ishai setton s first film i hope it will be released soon so everyone can see it
paris is an escher drawing with people and vehicles scurrying along at multiple levels in an obvious homage to fritz lang s metropolis paris is both ultramodern and crumbling into decay and in the blink between surveillance sweeps a pretty young medical researcher is kidnapped just after leaving her sister in a seedy nightclub a tough police captain investigates shown in stark black and white with the gloomy corridors shadowy alleys and single source lighting characteristic of the most hard boiled of film noir comparisons to sin city are inevitable but the story owes more to masamune shirow and william gibson than to frank miller as high tech surveillance near invisible stealth suits and ruthless super corporations are as much a part of the landscape as guns and cars the film never quite generates the doom laden atmosphere of gibson s cyberpunk vision with its tech heavy marginal characters clashing with industrial types from corporations that all seem to have their own ministry of fear but the viewer definitely gets the sense that future paris is no utopia and future science is less than benevolent and as the police procedural plot line unfolds we are taken into the darker recesses of individual ambition beneath the shiny veneer of avalon corporation s cultivated pr image the motion capture process used here produces a look somewhere between b w comic books and next generation rotoscoping and is either captivating or intrusive depending on your tastes nevertheless a great visual sense is on display here and future paris is filled in down to the tiny details giving the picture a unique look which is in turns both spartan and baroque worth a look
the mother is a weird low budget movie touching at least two uncomfortable themes not usually explored in the cinema denial of love of mother for their own son and daughter and lust and passion in the third age the characters are awful may is a disgusting old lady and i believe it is impossible to feel any kind of sympathy or sorrow for her she confesses that she did not love her son and her daughter she cheated her husband twice with an intellectual she steals the beloved man of her daughter not to protect her from a guy without moral that does not love her but just because she feel horny with him she is trying to organize her life after the loss of her husband in the worst possible way destroying her daughter delusions paula her daughter is a fragile loser who accepts her life the way it is her brother bobby is a man who lost his savings because of his wife who insists in having her shop a terrible business indeed darren is an amoral addicted jerk who does not like anybody even himself the acting and direction are excellent the actresses and actors have outstanding performances and the direction is very precise i liked this movie but i recognize that it is recommended for very specific audiences my vote is seven title brazil recome ar re start
a sweet and totally charming film shall we dansu made me laugh and cry at first appearance sugiyama san was not terribly appealing an uptight salaryman seemingly devoted to his family but all too easily captivated by a face in a window the object of his obsession is distant and cold but by the end of the movie i was in love with him her his wife and daughter all the dance instructors and dance students this uncomplicated story of transformation and renewal is a little jewel that i would enjoy seeing again
well i don t personally like rap but i still found fear of a black hat hilarious i m sure i didn t get some inside jokes but some i knew and it was funny enough to make me laugh just after i d stopped laughing i m a big fan of spinal tap so naturally i had to check this out it was deriviative from this is spinal tap sometimes blatantly but this film still stood on it s own as an original intelligent and funny satire my personal favorite back in the time of slaves they didn t have hats to protect them from the sun so at the end of the day they were too tired to revolt now we have hats
i love this movie beautifully funny and utterly believable characters each scene richer and more wonderful than the last every aspect of this movie is filled with wit and humour and love and depth a complex and engrossing story too this movie is filled with love humour and intelligence totally great
this movie is pretty good half a year ago i bought it on dvd but first i thought that it was the original film i have seen the series and it is a good film but here they have put the living legend part and and fire in space together the same as they did with the first film but with other episodes but still it is a pretty good film only the ending is strange you don t see what happens with the pegasus but i still think that it is pretty good the actors and special effects were good if you haven t seen it go see it starring richard hatch dirk benedict lorne greene herb jefferson jr tony swartz terry carter lloyd bridges jack stauffer
i was all ready to pan this episode seeing that this master really doesn t have any horror films under his belt but this is easily the best episode of the season the acting was good i don t know how he wrangled it but we ve got some real talent in this episode and while you could see things coming from a mile away plot wise at least it was entertaining and managed to keep me engaged for the full mins something that has been lacking up to this point in the series i especially liked the bit at the end not a twist per say but just a funny little bit where he becomes as ever the hen pecked hubby really good effort like i ve said in other reviews these are not true masters doing a lot of these episodes but they may someday end up being masters in the future
i really truly enjoyed this movie which is why it surprised me that it got such a low rating from so many users at this site i am not saying that it is a cinematic masterpiece but it was a great way to spend a cold snowy saturday night it is funny poignant and a great tales of the ups and downs of female friendships lasting through difficult times and the bad things that female friends tend to do to each others fess up ladies we have all been there bill paterson shines as the reverand gerald marsden and andie mcdowell proves that she can be a fine actress when the role is right and she puts her mind to it and truly there is the best wedding escape that i have ever seen or dreamed up in this film more guts than anyone i have ever known you will laugh and you will cry ignore any marketing campaigns and how this film is being marketing it is a hidden gem that should have done tonnes of box office now i have to look around to purchase a copy
the movie was sub par but this television pilot delivers a great springboard into what has become a sci fi fans ideal program the actors deliver and the special effects for a television series are spectacular having an intelligent interesting script doesn t hurt either stargate sg is currently one of my favorite programs
this was the first regular filmed columbo movie episode but yet it aired as the second after steven spielberg s columbo murder by the book it s also at the same time among one of the better ones bernard l kowalski was one great creative director no wonder that they later asked him to direct three more columbo movies the movie has some real creative and innovative shot sequences and the movie as a whole is also clearly made with style passion and eye for detail every shot connects and is a reason why this movie is better and also better looking just any other average made for tv movie it s definitely one of the better directed columbo movies it s a quit original columbo entry for a couple of reasons the murder is more or less an accident and was an impulsive act so the killer this time doesn t have any time to plan out the perfect murder in advance and his to clean up any of the traces afterward and has to dispose the body the killer in this movie is not only being handled as the man who committed the crime but more as the man who helps out lieutenant columbo to solve the murder it makes the character a more interesting and layered one as well and also helps to make the way columbo solves the whole crime seem way more interesting as well because of that of course columbo starts to suspect him pretty early on and as always he comes to solution by making himself vulnerable and look more stupid than he of course truly is and by gaining the killer s trust this is obviously no spoiler since this is the way every columbo movie gets set up i liked the story of the movie and how it progressed it also helps the movie that it has such a fine cast at the time of this movie peter falk had really made the columbo character his own and the character at this was already fully developed robert culp is truly great as the short tempered brimmer funny thing is that he would later star in three different columbo movies again and one mrs columbo episode only in totally different roles he even played the murderer in a couple of those movies as well again he by the way was not the only actor that did this in other later columbo movies also the great ray milland makes an appearance in this movie as the husband of the victim all in all a real great early columbo movie and among the better ones out of the long running series of movies
bill crain s rarer than rare slasher movie certainly doesn t follow the standard stalk and slash guidelines that have become so essential of its counterparts the bogeyman this time around uses grenades and small arms as well as an awesome array of melee weapons a sin that s virtually unacceptable in most post halloween genre pieces but there s still just enough familiarity to keep slasher buffs from checking the rule book and the plot never strays too far from the path that you ve grown to expect just as wally koz s surprisingly decent was seemingly put together with help from various members of his family mirage seems to have been a joint production from relatives of the director looking through the credits i noticed numerous crains listed in key positions throughout the construction of the feature but despite fairly good distribution across the globe the movie failed to make an impression either side of the atlantic and now it has become pretty much a phantom of the vhs market nevertheless this only made it appeal to me even more and so i strained my resources to track a copy down it all takes place in the middle of the dessert which as i m sure you ll agree is hardly the most exciting location with that said though i must admit that there s certainly going to be no chance of any nosey john q laws turning up unexpectedly four undeniably beautiful youngsters head out into the sand for a night of debauchery and frolics that always seems to rub homicidal maniacs the wrong way chris jennifer mcallister and her boyfriend greg kenny johnson meet up with amusing new age hippies trip kevin mcparland and mary nicole anton at a make shift camp site in the midst of the dune like wilderness greg s older brother kyle todd schaefer and his buxom girlfriend bambi laura albert soon turn up to join the body count applicants in their quest for an early grave kyle used to date chris before his younger brother took the liberty of stealing his squeeze something that kyle doesn t seem too keen to forget sound like a motive for a massacre well what did you expect before long an unseen someone driving a truck with tinted windows joins the gathering with a unique set of tricks up his sleeve will any of the kids survive to turn up for a sequel i have had trouble tracking down any information at all about this feature i don t even know if director bill crain is aka william crain the man behind midnight fear and blacula among others mirage certainly doesn t appear on his official filmography so your guess is as good as mine judging by the credible work behind the camera i d have to say that i find it hard to believe that this is the debut of a man with no previous cinematic experience the film is stylishly photographed with some superb work from dp michael crain and the director boasts a credible talent for building suspense when it s necessary r christopher biggs gore fx are imaginatively created and gruesome and kudos to the sleepy head over at the bbfc who inexplicably let this pass through uncut on a usually stringent rating a couple of the murders are indeed extremely macabre one guy gets buried up to his neck in sand before coming face to face with a grenade while another ends up literally legless after loosing a battle with a chain and a pick up truck there s also some black humor that s surely unintentional we spend the majority of the feature seeing only the killer s boots as he steps out of his vehicle and stalks the youngsters but when he s revealed to hilariously resemble keanu reeves circa bill and ted s bogus journey i didn t quite know what to expect thankfully crain knows exactly how to keep things creepy and the showdown is particularly mean spirited as the psycho taunts chris sadistically there are some surprisingly good performances on display from an extremely inexperienced cast the divine jennifer mcallister does a superb job as the heroine and b g steers portrays off his rocker dementia with finesse the casting director chose wisely to pick some of the most beautiful females ever slaughtered in slasher cinema and it gratefully doesn t come at the cost of thespian potential the soundtrack works well to build the desolate atmosphere of isolation which is carefully handled by a director that should have been signed and nurtured by hollywood bigwigs watch out for the superb nightmare sequence that is truly horror film making at it s freakiest mirage is a good late entry to the cycle that was somewhat unfortunate to miss a boom year placing amongst the slasher elite when you consider that this was made with just a cast of seven and a pick up truck you have to say that they did a damn good job the flaws are numerous but never detract credibility from the net result unfortunately you ve probably got more chance of finding liquid gold in your coffee mug than you have of ever tracking down a copy if you see this one covered in dust on the top shelf of your local video store then make sure you pick it up recommended
diagnosis murder is one of the only programs i watch regularly on tv now the way all of the main characters have something to do in each of the episodes makes it so unlike today s shows where they concentrate on or people per episode and everyone else is shoved to the side the way mark s brain works is also so obscure that you never really know what he is thinking and if you think you do you are wrong diagnosis murder has tackled a diverse range of topics not just in the cases but in each of the characters personal lives everything from racism and adoption to terrorists and technology as for it being for old people i am i don t think i can be classed as old yet i just want to know when they will be releasing all seasons on dvd not ntsc so that i can watch them all in order they seem to be doing it with lots of other programs from the same era so can they hurry it up a bit

when this film opened back in legend has that it was met with massive jeering and disdain it was widely considered a failure i vividly remember ebert giving it one star and it was supposedly booed at cannes apparently these people didn t understand the movie which is not that hard to comprehend since it s very esoteric dark and layered in ways that still astound me reading through many of the reviews here i find even after about viewings over the years many elements of the film i had previously glossed over but even without understanding much the psychological underpinnings of the story it s still a cracking suspenser even if you just take the escalating paranoia and persecution that overtakes polanski s title character like a tsunami wave over the course of it s two hour running time examining the source material an excellent novella by underrated novelist roland topor uncovers more intriguing layers polanski s trekovsky is a milquetoast of the highest order though he seems at first to be yet another mild everyday soul one gradually realizes he is one of those people who seems to aimlessly drift through life letting it direct him he seems to have few strong feelings about his likes and dislikes he finds himself gently pushed this way and that but never seems to get too bent out of shape regardless this vague sort of wishy washy ness is more noticeable in the novel than the movie but there are hints of it early in the film too making a play for the apartment of a woman one mademouiselle choule who is in the hospital recovering from a recent suicide attempt appears to be the most daring thing he has attempted even effectively haggling down the price of the deposit in the bargain he soon finds however that he is paying for his good thing in more ways than he cares as he finds himself in the center of maelstrom created by a building full of neurotic control freaks who are hypersensitive to even the slightest sign of human life such as a footstep in the night or a knock on the door instead of taking a stand though trelkovsky becomes increasingly alienated by the situation and overtaken by paranoia and a sense of persecution he becomes obsessed with choule imagining himself to be like her dressing like her etc as his own personality rapidly begins to be wiped away by his own insanity if anyone has ever doubted polanski s fearlessness as an artist they d be well advised to see this film his trademark black humor is prominently and sometimes embarrassingly on display here and god bless him he makes himself the butt of it it s a tour de force performance in one of the richest riskiest most gothic horror movies ever made that more people haven t seen it is a true crime
i ll be honest with you i liked this movie it s a great zombie flick that is packed with action original ideas good acting but is also packed with bad zombie effects part iv entitled after death is also good i would recommend this movie to horror fans everywhere out of fans of horror movies like this should check out puppet master skinned alive slumber party massacre sleep away camp and other full moon pictures flicks for other recommendations check out the other comments i have sent in by clicking on my name above this comment section
holes is not your average disney stuff it s very very fun even for adults who usually cringe at the cutesy focus group designed family entertainment that uncle walt s studio passes off as live action perhaps the secret of this film s success is in its faithfulness to the original book which is a little bit darker than your average kid stuff the action begins when stanley yelnats is sent to a boys prison camp where all the inmates are forced to dig holes under the desert sun as a form of rehibilitation but as the story progresses stanley s tale becomes interwoven with that of a legendary treasure and this adventure becomes ten times more fun than any disney movie about an all boy prison camp has any right to be jon voight is especially nasty and colorful and sigourney weaver is beautiful as always
this movie was amazing it is the kind of movie where you watch it and rather than look at other movies by actor you look at other movies by director writer sandler did a good job working a character outside of his comfort zone and the always good cheadle did a great job too this movie is great for a mature intelligent audience the acting was fantastic and can only be surpassed by the writing and directing of the film this film focuses on the real americans the past generation no stereotypes or racism just people who have come together and realized the true meaning of life this film is about loss and coping instead of picking on psychiatry it defines it not as someone who heals you magically but rather through the necessity of talking out your feeling to an impartial someone you can trust will not judge you but rather will guide you though your thoughts this movie is all round amazing
when i learned of sir alec guinness death this was the first of his many films i thought of re seeing what a wonderful droll commentary the film provides even after all these years and guinness helps to weave the charm into every frame his eyes and face are as luminous as that white suit he wears both he and the film have to be considered lifetime favorites
keeping all political views aside feroz khan and anil kapoor s gandhi my father is a good movie that cleverly explores the confused towards family side of mohandas karamchand gandhi and the fight of his eldest son harilal gandhi with the society his larger than life father and most importantly demons in his head one draws parallels to gandhi the father of the nation and struggles any son could have with their fatherthe acting is good shefali shetty darshan zariwala and akshaye khanna strictly in that order add color and pathos to this heart wrenching tale of harilal who weeps to be hugged just once and also runs away at the faintest touch of the finger feroz khan s direction and the production canvas is lavish and attractive however the screenplay could ve been tighter i had seen the play some years ago on a pirated video type dvd it was called mahatama vs gandhi i think and it was certainly more gripping though the movie s background score and the father son and mother son moments are just a brilliant treat this movie could have been great it s borderline to that it has the potential so huge to have been just a story differences between a father and son or just gandhi or even both somewhere the plot is lost and when you expect absolute epitome of emotions nothing comes to you it compares decently to other gandhi s certainly not an overview film like kingsley s gandhi or abstract as kamal hassan s hey ram the film just about manages to find its footing however one is left wondering what if worth a watch
i was having just about the worst day of my life then i stumbled on this cute film watched it and now i m ready to go out kiss a streetlamp i have to admit i only watched it for reasons vera ellen s legs but it s really so much more the plot is actually quite clever and creatively woven it s almost like a shakespearean comedy with all of its delightful misunderstandings and of course there s also vera ellen s legs the only unfortunate aspect of this film is that the version i purchased the family classics collection by mill creek entertainment doesn t have the best video quality and i ve heard the same about the alpha release the brightness and contrast are a bit too high so a lot of the scenes seem bleached out especially when vera is dancing in a white dress but i suppose you can fiddle with the controls of your tv set to compensate i can only imagine how it looked on the big screen back in the stage sets costumes colours are otherwise dazzling delightfully creepy sort of in a cabinet of dr caligari vein as far as the romance goes this is just perfect not sappy not contrived not melodramatic just ahhhhhh too bad you poor schmucks your miserable lives will never be as charming as this har har har wait what am i laughing at my life sucks just as bad as yours oh hell time to watch this movie again
great voices lots of adventure and clever dialogue make this a very good movie the addition of character to the three lead animals gives the story a lot more depth and meaning particularly the relationship between the older fellow shadow and the young hellraiser chance the earlier versions of this film were unable to give the animals any real personality or motive which is done perfectly here sally field is lovable in anything but really shines in this film as the proud feline sassy great contrast between cat and dog perspectives on life and just the right amount of spirit and warm fuzzies to make the plot and resolution excellent there s even an uplifting score and beautiful mountain scenery definitely perfect for an evening alone or with the kids hats off to disney
this is a pretty well known one so i won t get too deep into it the basic story is about two teens who find out about a slimy alien blob of goo that arrives to earth via meteor human contact with this slime ball burns through flesh like acid it also absorbs human bodies making it grow bigger nobody believes the teens steeve mcqueen and his girlfriend and when they finally do it seems that the blob can t be stopped it s really well done for it s age and unlike a lot of other s flicks the pace is pretty fast the story is very unique making it and a must see for any fan of old sci fi and monster movies if you can dig the gooey gore of s horror be sure to check out the remake from as well
simply one of the best ever richard brooks adaptation of truman capote s non fiction novel is truly an artistic achievement stunning black and white cinematography that should have won an oscar a haunting quincy jones score and tremendous performances by robert blake and scott wilson as the oddly matched killers this film was for at the academy awards and wasn t even nominated for best picture while dr doolittle was go figure although you don t get to know the clutter family as well as you do in the book it was a good decision to focus more on perry and dick and the pain staking process of tracking these guys down john forsythe is also impressive as alvin dewey there are simply no flaws in this one out of best performance scott wilson with r blake a close second highly recommended
this movie is really not all that bad but then again this movie genre is right down my alley sure the sets are cheap but they really did decent with what they had if you like cheap futuristic post apocalyptic b movies then you ll love this one i sure did
as a knowledgeable fan i recommend this film as faithful to the facts and well acted as an year old living in istanbul i heard some friends talking about a new music sensation that caused girls to scream i thought hmmmm if girls like them they must be crap my only records until then were haley mills the everly brothers ricky nelson soon after while on vacation with the family at a military cafeteria in ismir i heard a song which i later learned was love me do and was floored by the difference between it and every song i had ever heard until then when i heard the meet the beatles album of my older brother i was hooked for life having read the definitive book of their beginnings by davis i was surprised that this movie followed the facts very well with the exception of leaving out most of the sex and some of the drug use it did touch on the use of methadrine dexadrine
i would just like all of the fans of this documentary to know that martin torgoff is my uncle and i am so darn proud of him this mini series that in shown on vh is a great look at the culture of drugs in the past years and my uncle worked very hard on it the amount of time and effort that i have watched him put into this documentary and the book that started it all can t find my way home makes it that much better to watch him on tv i know that he loves what he does and he does it well his eloquence is shown in the interviews which he did himself and the amazing additions that he himself adds to the commentary from the music to the videos and everything in between this is a great documentary that really shows the experience of the drug culture through the eyes of someone who lived through it i appreciate any comments on this from those who enjoyed it or didn t and would love to hear from fans three cheers for uncle martin
this is probably the fastest paced and most action packed of the german edgar wallace krimi series a cross between the dr mabuse films of yore and s pop thrillers like batman and the man from uncle it reintroduces the outrageous villain from an earlier film who dons a stylish monk s habit and breaks the necks of victims with the curl of a deadly whip set at a posh girls school filled with lecherous middle aged professors and with the cops fondling their hot to trot secretaries at every opportunity it certainly is a throwback to those wonderfully politically incorrect times there s a definite link to a later wallace based film the excellent giallo whatever happened to solange which also concerns female students being corrupted by and corrupting their elders quite appropriate to the monk theme the master mind villain uses booby trapped bibles here to deal some of the death blows and also maintains a reptile replete dungeon to amuse his captive audiences alfred vohrer was always the most playful and visually flamboyant of the series directors and here the lurid colour cinematography is the real star of the show the monk appears in a raving scarlet cowl and robe tastefully setting off the lustrous white whip while appearing against purplish night backgrounds there s also a voyeur friendly turquoise swimming pool which looks great both as a glowing milieu for the nubile students and as a shadowy backdrop for one of the murder scenes the trademark kicker of hiding the ende card somewhere in the set of the last scene is also quite memorable here and there s a fine brassy and twangy score for retro music fans fans of the series will definitely miss the flippant eddie arent character in these later films instead the chief inspector sir john takes on the role of buffoon convinced that he has mastered criminal psychology after taking a few night courses unfortunately klaus kinski had also gone on to bigger and better things the krimis had lost some of their offbeat subversive charm by this point and now worked on a much more blatant pop culture level which will make this one quite accessible to uninitiated viewers
the most amazing spiritually uplifting movie about the restoration of the gospel far better than any other film or movie made about the restoration thus far if you haven t seen it hop on a plane to salt lake and see it now you won t regret it you truly get a sense of what the first saints had to struggle through putting complete and total faith in there prophet joseph smith you finally get some sort of comprehension of the things the prophet had to fight through and the persecutions he and his people faced if you have any questions about the church of jesus christ of latter days saints and our humble beginnings just watch this movie it will make complete and total sense afterward
until i saw this special on hbo i had never heard of eddie izzard i sure am glad that i have now he is one of the funniest comedians i have ever seen rarely has a comedian immersed himself so completely in his craft then eddie i could not stop laughing for the entire show if you like to laugh you have to see this special
sometimes it takes a film making master like kubrick to bring that extra little something that unique untractable and elusive ingredient that transforms a great movie or a great script into a masterpiece one for the ages it s not just that stephen king s story has enough meat and potatoes making it difficult for even the most workmanlike of directors to miss heck even king himself didn t fare so bad it s how kubrick perceives king s universe how he transforms the page into screen time that renders the shining both a visual feast and a compacted masterclass in directing kubrick s miss en scene is as usually terrific the movie progresses with a brisk sharp lively pace even though it s neither fast nor heavily edited and it clocks at no less than minutes the camera prowls through the lavish corridors of the overlook hotel like it is some kind of mystic labyrinth rife for exploration linear tracking shots exposing the impeccably decorated interiors in all their grandeur there s a symmetry and geometrical approach in how kubrick perceives space that reminds me very much of how japanese directors worked in the sixties as if what is depicted is inconsequential to how all the different elements are balanced inside the frame certain images definitely stand out the first shot of jack s typewriter accompanied off screen from the thumps of a ball like drums of doom coming from some other floor or produced by the typewriter itself as though it is an instrument of doom all by itself later on proving to be nothing short of just that a red river flowing through the hotel s elevators in slow motion jack hitting the door with the axe the camera moving along with him tracking the action as it happens instead of remaining static as though it s the camera piercing through the door and not the axe the ultra fast zoom in the kid s face thrusting us inside his head before we see the two dead girls from his pov and of course the bathroom scene much has been said of jack nicholson s obtrusive overacting his mad is not entirely successful because well he s jack nicholson the guy looks half mad anyway playing mad turns him into an exaggerated caricature of himself shelley duvall on the other hand is one of the most inspired casting choices kubrick ever had coming from a streak of fantastic performances for robert altman in the seventies women thieves like us nashville she brings to her character the right amounts of fragility and emotional distress a terrific and very underrated actress
love the tv show was hooked first time i saw it wish i was there acting in with them it touches reality when you love someone and you are thinking that you want to spend the rest of your life with then at a turn of events that you meet someone else and that person is more of who you want to be with you are in a situation were you have to choose one or the other someone is going to get hurt there s no stopping that making the decision is hard but do you want to go on being unhappy when you could have been why go on and live a life that you thought that you wanted or thinking you are doing the right thing and you both be unhappy that other person isn t going to wait a life time waiting they have a life a well making the decision that you really want will be better in the end making the best of what you have is a good thing a well money cars houses etc don t make you happy having the one person that you really want to be with to share it with does

this is john waters best film to date the characters are obvious and symbolic just as in his other films so there are no surprises or character changes i enjoyed the film because of the wittiness and pace of the story it was good story telling with honest people
i am a big fan of the movie but not for the usual reasons i think travolta and winger performed at higher than average rates i think the sets were representative of the location and the era i liked the sound track and the charlie daniels band however i think the photography was amazing since the interior scenes were filmed in the actual club and gilley s had low ceilings perhaps feet high and the smoke that was supposed to simulate a smoke filled bar hung feet below the ceiling the camera managed to get shots through the smoke and focus on the actors the bull the bar the women the dancing the low level of light that actually was in the bar what a feat sure there was auxiliary lighting but in order to maintain the atmosphere of the bar it had to be low light shots ray villalobos the camera operator was outstanding he got some shots he had no hope of achieving and the impact of them brought a sense of reality to the film thanks ray great work

fever pitch is a fun enough movie it has a lot of funny moments including a hilariously disturbing shower scene like most romantic comedies it has a dead zone in the middle where all the heavy she s breaking up with me stuff happens but other than that it continues to be funny until the end even though the plot revolves around fanaticism towards the red sox it s not overloaded with sports you don t have to be a fan to enjoy this film of course that s easy for me to say i ve been a red sox fan since i was a boy too out of barky
all films made before really need to be viewed with a sense of time and place in the lumiere family men father antoine sons auguste and louis owned and managed a factory that manufactured photographic plates and paper not a small enterprise the factory had more than employees who received pension and social security benefits innovative for that time it was located at montplaisir in the suburbs of lyon france what caused louis lumiere to become interested in building a cinematagraph in remains open for speculation my suggestion is that the appearance of the edison organization s kinetoscope peep show machine in paris during the fall of provided the catalyst w k l dickson of edison s staff invented a motion picture camera about the size of an upright piano that was patented in february it was electrically operated using power from from heavy storage batteries this massive machine pumped celluloid film strip newly developed by the eastman company past a lens at about frames per second fps it was ensconced as an almost immovable object in the black maria essentially the first movie studio the kinetescope machines showed staged presentations less than one minute long that were filmed in this studio during louis lumiere applied himself to the task of inventing a moving picture camera he had determined that even at fps on celluloid film the persistence of vision of the human eye brain would allow for normal motion to be perceived his camera dubbed the cinematograph was about the size of a large shoe box and was provided with a detachable film magazine that provided storage for enough film to make a shoot last about one minute when it was had cranked past the lens at fps the size and light weight of the camera it could be converted into a printer or a projector by the addition of a light source made it portable enough that it could be taken to any location to record an event provided there was enough sunlight available in the spring of louis filmed trick riding by some cavalry men a house on fire with firemen arriving and dousing the engulfed building with water and a number of other scenes in and around lyon using a molteni bulb he turned the camera into a projector and presented his films to scientists assembled in the reception room of the revue generales des science the images were projected on a screen five meters distant from the lens the screen was stretched in a doorway between two rooms at a meeting of professional photographers that same year louis photographed the arriving delegates and the same evening showed them motion pictures of their arrival with accolades from both the scientific and photographic communities louis decided to have a public exhibition of his invention by the end of the year since each of his films would be about one minute long he would need at least a dozen films to make a good presentation for one of these films he set up his camera at the entrance to his factory photographing the egress of employees at quitting time the public venue chosen by antoine who offered himself as the fairground barker for the cinematograph was the salon indien of the grand cafe on the boulevard des capucines in paris it was a wintry saturday night on december as the first audience sat they were presented with a projected view of the exterior of the lumiere factory with closed gates some were chagrined that they were just going to see a routine slide show of lumiere photographs but then the crank on the camera projector was turned and movement began louis had an innate sense for motion picture taking this film has a beginning a middle and an end in the beginning the doors are opened and people begin to leave their workplace during the middle the people stream out with many trying to ignore the camera and the cameraman as they seem to be happy to leave a day of labor behind them at the end the gates to the factory are being closed and this was the first film projected for the entertainment of the general public
astaire and rogers at the height of their popularity in americans thought of the navy as a place for song and dance wwii was still a few years away fred and ginger dance up the town the plot is decent but who cares by the way notice the cameo roles for betty grable and a glamorous lucile ball a load of irving berlin songs including the famous let s face the music and dance in that scene ginger s heavy swooping dress smacks fred in the face during one of her spins and almost knocks him unconscious fred insisted on keeping the take as the dancing was superb nonetheless ginger once commented that she was a better dancer than fred since she had to do all the same moves in step and backwards come to think of it fred s voice was nice too the man was effortless in motion here s a movie to cozy up on the couch with a loved one kick off the shoes and enjoy the entertainment
without a doubt private lessons ii is the greatest movie i have ever seen a japanese import poorly translated into english its a joy to watch not much of it makes sense but that doesn t matter it s the greatest comedy around without ever being intentionally funny the film is rare and unavailable on video but i have caught it a couple of time late late at night on pay cable my taped copy has been watched dozens and dozens of times as i slowly person by person introduce this film gem to the world joanna pacula plays the tutor lover to ken our hero she apparently was just working for her check ken is played by goro inagaki of the japanese pop band smap who gives it his all and has great hair through out the movie stacy edwards of in the company of men fame shows up in the movie too and is probably happy that she found other film work afterwards it takes at least three viewings to sorta figure out what the plot is on repeating viewing you can enjoy elements like the abnormal amount of vases ken has in his house at least or that ken is wearing a shirt with embroidered husks of corn in the movie s finale the movie is predictable but highly quotable my friends and i reenact entire scenes yes it sounds like we re lame losers and we are but we re lame losers who have seen private lessons ii be one of ten people in the world who have seen this movie you ll thank me for it
one of my all time favorite so laughably lousy that it s totally lovable el cheapo and stinko nickel n dime independent horror creature features an enjoyably dreadful marvel that was released by the formidably fecund exploitation outfit crown international pictures so it could play numerous crappy double bills at countless drive ins back in the s and eventually wound up being rerun like crazy on several small time secondary cable stations throughout the s i naturally first saw this gloriously ghastly abomination on late night television one fateful saturday evening while in my early teens and have had a deep seated albeit completely irrational abiding fondness for it ever since a meteorite falls out of the sky and crashes into the still waters of a tranquil country lake thereby causing a heretofore dormant dinosaur egg to hatch of course the baby dino immediately grows into a gigantic waddling grunting teeth gnashing prehistoric behemoth with goofy flippers an extended neck and a huge mouth full of little sharp jagged stalagmite like chompers our southern fried male cousin to the loch ness monster promptly starts chowing down on various luckless local yokel residents of a previously quiet and sleepy hillbilly resort town it s up to drippy stalwart sheriff richard cardella assisted by the painfully idiotic hayseed comic relief brotherly fishing guide duo of glenn roberts and mark seigel feisty gal pal kacey cobb and terminally insipid nerdy scientist bob hyman to get to the bottom of things before the over sized gluttonous jurassic throwback ruins the tourist trade by eating all the campers and fisherman that the hick hamlet makes its cash off of director co screenwriter william r stromberg displays a wonderfully woeful and thoroughly clueless incompetence when it comes to pacing atmosphere taut narrative construction and especially eliciting sound credible acting from his hopelessly all thumbs rank amateur community theater level cast the performances are uniformly abysmal cardella is way too bland and wooden to cut it as a solid heroic lead while the pitifully dopey redneck comic antics of roberts and seigel provoke groans of slack jawed disbelief you aren t laughing with these two atrociously mugging clods so much as at them particularly when the insufferable imbeciles discover a severed head bobbing up and down in the murky lake water better yet a clumsily integrated sub plot concerning a vicious on the loose criminal leads to a spectacularly ham fisted supermarket hold up scene which degenerates into a hilariously stupid mini massacre when a young lady shopper interrupts the stick up artist in mid robbery a subsequent car chase is likewise severely bungled as well it s so limply staged and unimpressive that one feels more relieved than scared when the monster abruptly pops up to devour the nefarious fugitive moreover david allen s funky herky jerky stop motion animation dinosaur is the authentic gnarly article projecting a certain raw charisma sneaky reptilian personality and overall forceful screen presence which makes all the horrendously underwhelming human characters seem like pathetically unbecoming nobody bores in comparison and as for the rousing conclusion where the sheriff takes on our slavering beastie with a bulldozer the operative word for this thrilling confrontation is boffo all the way
harman and isings old mill pond is a true masterpiece of the art of animation the consummate skill and artistry that characterise this duos work is nowhere more in evidence than in this cartoon it is a shame that so many people can see only offence in what is and was always intended to be a light hearted piece of entertainment that in no way sought to denigrate black people if anything it is a tribute to the infectious humour and musicality of the black race i have not been able to view this confection for many years as the race commissars in england have deemed it too offensive to be shown in multi racial britain if anyone knows where i can obtain a copy i would dearly love to view this masterpiece again i think those who routinely look for messages and intent that were never intended in these cartoons which are after all sixty years old should try to lighten up and remember that the world is a very different place today but that does not mean that anyone has the right to censor what is viewable from the past
the idea is a very smart title the film has a serious tongue in cheek feel to it but it is so subtle you don t know how to read it are these guys doing a full blown comedy or is there something else going on the little dialogue the film has isn t very delicate and this adds to the power of the film if all the sound was switched off from the film it actually wouldn t take anything away from the film the physical actions or the art of showing is so strong that it on its own carries the entirety of the story i is a blessing and with the blessing the emotion is followed by shame i first say this film as part of a black film festival after watching the film i was so impressed by the work but then i asked myself what next where can someone else see this work the common association of art without purpose isn t to be found here you can see the intention in the design from the start to the finish the usage of african music the style the casting everything seems planned and for a reason the character development is amazing the casting i think is the strongest aspect of the film the characters are easily defined within minutes of the minutes of actual film we need to see more of these kinds of films there really needs to be greater support for the development of short films across the board
this is one of the first independent movies i ve ever seen for such a very low budget it was done well as an insomniac myself i can sympathize with the main character although my sleeping problems have never been as intense or as disturbing well directed well acted of a subject that i haven t seen much in theaters lighting and set both perfect for the movie setting there are few noticeable goofs but they may be intended you ll see after you watch the movie the movie is very personal and worth watching twice no movie is flawless but a hollywood version couldn t do the story better all in all
very rarely does denzil washington make a bad movie and come to think of it that goes for kevin kline and in this case this must count as one of their best films it is more about of film about how strong friendship can more than the story of steve biko although we do get an insight into what the man was like and how far the reporter and friend donald woods went to preserve the mans name and let the world know what a corrupt putrid society south africa was the direction is outstanding from david attenborough as it was for gandhi although if there is any critisism to be aimed it could be at the length of the film two and a half hours is a long time to sit through a historic movie what is amazing is how he manages to control all the extras thousands of people in both films this film really does open your eyes to what happened before the break up of aparthiet and you cannot fail to moved by it out of
i have to admit that purple rain is one of my deepest guilty pleasures purple rain not only broke boundaries it set a decade the costumes the music the behavior and the dancing to this day my friends and i still jam to the purple rain soundtrack and pretend to be prince and the revolution now the movie itself i just meant what i said in the title because for the most part this movie itself is made by the music the acting please don t let me judge on that since this is one of my favorite guilty pleasures because i know that it was not oscar worthy by any means but i think the duo that took this movie was morris and jarome their speech about passwords was just beyond hilarious i just want to rate this movie on the concert sequences because i felt that it was what made the movie prince is a musical genius and created beautiful music while the movie and acting is pretty bad this movie is still a fun one to watch at night and even dance too this movie defined the s so just have fun with it prince would want it that way just to party on down oh boy that sounded lame
deanna durbin nan grey and barbara read are three smart girls in this universal film from which introduces deanna durbin to film audiences it also stars ray milland mischa auer charles winninger john king binnie barnes and alice brady it s a sweet story about three young women now living in switzerland with their divorced mother who hear their father winninger is marrying again not having seen him in years and knowing their mother still loves him they board a ship to america with the help of the housekeeper nanny determined to stop the wedding realizing that the intended called precious barnes is nothing but a gold digger aided and abetted by her mother brady they arrange for her to be introduced to a wealthy count this is arranged by their father s accountant king the man he chooses is a full time drunk auer but the girls mistake him for an actual wealthy count milland what a mess this is a delightful film not cloying or overly sugary at all with some nice performances particularly by auer milland barnes and brady the young women are pretty and all do good work the emphasis of course is on young durbin who is a natural actress and a beautifully trained singer in fact her voice as a youngster is much more even than it would be as an adult she has no trouble with the high notes as she did later on because she put too much weight in the middle voice she sings a delightful il bacio in a police station one of the nicest things about the film is to see the father played by charles winninger not want his children around until he sees them and gets to know them barnes as the gold digger isn t all that young but the girls mother looks way up there so the inference probably was the older man seeking his youth with a younger more glamorous woman in fact he finds the youth he was seeking in his daughters universal gives durbin the big star buildup here she has the final shot in the movie ray milland at this point was still paying his dues and it will probably be a surprise even to film fans how young and attractive he is very entertaining and of course this led to a sequel and big stardom for deanna
after beau travail everybody was waiting for claire denis to make a follow up masterpiece that never arrived now it has denis makes a quantum leap in this film an orgy of gorgeous cinematography elliptical editing and willfully obscure narrative events that feels strange and acts even stranger there s a nominal plot derived partly from the jean luc nancy book of the same name about a mature man in need of a heart transplant and who seeks a tahitian son he abandoned long ago but mostly it s an exploration of the idea of intrusions personal and cultural it takes a couple of viewings to fully comprehend and has pacing problems close to the end but it s still more advanced and gripping than anything else i ve seen this year miss it at your peril
i don t know why the critics trashed this movie i hardly ever agree with them anyway the movie could have been a little scarier i don t usually go to horror movies i even had to psych myself up to see it in the daytime i needn t have bothered the cinema was full of kids too heh liam was great as always i also liked catharine zeta jones theo and lili taylor eleanor nell the house was very gothic and beautiful in a spooky way the special and sound effects were awesome i also loved the music score particularly the gentle tunes for eleanor and her journey to save the children how she grew out of her stagnant routine and life and finally gain her power peace and freedom
the first time i saw this film i loved it when i was i was more interested in the music and dancing as i ve grown older i ve become more interested in the acting as well while the first half is just a retrospective of michael s career from the jackson up to bad it was still entertaining to watch the badder sequence could ve been left out though the kids were pretty good speed demon and leave me alone were funny especially when the police officer tells michael i need your autograph right here after stopping him for dancing in a no dancing zone but it s smooth criminal that s the icing on the cake joe pesci did an excellent job as the toughie and that hair was wild the dancing is perfect and so are the special effects the only thing i could have done without was the spiders any fan of michael s should see this if you haven t already i give it a
my family goes back to new orleans late s early s and in watching the movie i knew it was a history my grand parents never talked about but we knew it existed i have cousins obviously black aka african americans and others who can pass as white and chose not to it s a hard history to watch when you realize that it s your family they re talking about and that cane river is all a part of that history it makes me want to cry and it makes me want to kick the arse of my great grandfathers who owned those plantations and wonder in awe of how my great grandmothers of african heritage lived under that oppressive and yet aristocratic existence and at the same time had i not come out of that history i probably wouldn t be the successful business woman i am today living successfully in a fairly integrated world the acting was both excellent and fair depending upon the actor but it is a movie that needed to be made anne rice is incredible and i ask myself why is she symbolically writing about my family and i m not i recommend this movie to everyone leza
this film is actually pertinent even today given the threat of bio terrorism and the threats of superbugs west nile virus and sars as a thriller the tension is fairly intense richard widmark and paul douglas are more than serviceable in their roles the domestic scenes between widmark and his wife provide a nice interlude to the main plot the actor in this film who most left his mark is jack palance his sharply defined features and seemingly easygoing exterior always wither way to reveal the avaricious and cruel man beneath the surface the chase scene through the packing plant is impressive even today recommended
the film version of alice walker s hugely emotive and influential novel written largely as letters from the central character celie to god was a massive oscar success and rightly so in the role of the abused and awakened celie whoopi goldberg gave her best screen performance by miles not far behind her was oprah winfrey as sofia the fiery woman tamed by fate others in the cast fleshed out the characters walker had introduced so clearly on the page danny glover as albert celie s abusive husband margaret avery as shug a force of change for the good willard pugh and rae dawn chong as harpo and squeak susan beaubian as corrine the preacher s wife and the much missed carl anderson otherwise best known as judas in the film of jesus christ superstar as preacher samuel beautifully paced and sensitively written the color purple does justice to its source while opening out the story to involve viewers of a feature length drama
this film takes place in the s according to this the dead called zombies have arisen to eat the living however a company has developed a collar that when put around the zombies neck makes them docile and perfect servants the robinsons mom helen carrie anne moss dad bill dylan baker and son timmy k sun ray hire a zombie because everyone on their block already has one tim names the zombie fido billy connolly and becomes friends with him but his dad hates him and timmy looses control of fido and things go wrong as you can see this is among many other things a takeoff on the lassie series with fido being a stand in for lassie timmy was named that for a reason every single of the famous lassie episodes are spun here my favorite is when timmy sends fido off to get help before the zombies eat him also it s a satire of those s douglas sirk films where everything is bright and colorful but dark secrets are tearing people apart the characters wear very bright s clothes moss is always in a dress the furnishings settings and cars especially are all s in hyper bright colors even when the script becomes repetitious there s always something to look at the script is good but there are only so many lassie jokes you can make the melodramatics are kind of silly but the cast pulls it off everyone here is excellent and right on target even connolly as an emotionless zombie does a good job moss is the best playing each line for all its worth but never going overboard this isn t for everybody of course the satire may be lost on most people and the gore is pretty tame the gore is done so casually and with happy music playing over it it s hard to take it seriously so for some people this will really work i give it an
the mother is one of those films that you know is good maybe even great but it is like eating vegetables or doing math homework is to a kid too much work and a whole lot of pain to get invested in the story is potentially distasteful in many ways the death of a character within the first half hour the december may romance the idea of a man cheating on his wife and then cheating on his lover with her mother the collection of weak and rather unpleasant thirty something characters the apparent indifference of the adults to the children in their lives this movie was made in the or but is a throw back to a collection of british usually made for tv movies from the late s it has a moral severity that never lets up which produces an enveloping throbbing angst the mother is flawless but that is in part the problem if a film dealing with so many sensitive issues has some flaws inconsistencies of script some lesser actors it takes the edge off but if such a film is so pitch perfect the experience of watching it is raw and painful even the technical qualities lighting editing etc make the viewer ache the london in this movie is bright and open filled with harsh cutting light if you are tough as nails or are one of those super sensitive people who likes to torture themselves with gut wrenching sad movies or novels then you will enjoy the mother anyone in between give it a miss or be prepared to squirm and be warned as tough as the movie is from beginning to near end the worst is to come toward the end of the movie the mother asks her daughter what she can do to make up for it for having slept with her boyfriend and the daughter calmly says that she has thought about it and would like to hit her the mother agrees to this they both stand up and instead of a well primed slap the daughter clenches her fist and delivers a boxer s blow argh
personally i think sayonara was the greatest movie he ever made it touched every emotion from anger to romance to complete tragedy and brando should have won for best actor anyway the movie is awesome the man is attractive to both men and women and now you have no reason not to see it do so and fall in love
an unconventional historical drama with some fine battle scenes tobey maguire gives an excellent performance and gets some pretty good back up the script is literate and pretty original and the film is kept mercifully free of heroes that said it does drag a bit and the last reel is too much like a tv mini series still frederick elmes s camerawork keeps one interested in the dull bits and every now and again you see a shot which reminds you he worked for david lynch worth seeing
i first discovered alexander korda s fantasy the thief of bagdad in the early s on a re issue billed as the wonder show of the century both korda technicolor films the thief of bagdad and jungle book were shown on one never to be forgotten program the music of miklos rozsa enhanced both films the technicolor in each was incredibly beautiful the thief of bagdad has remained on my list as the best fantasy film ever made as the years passed it became more difficult to enjoy the film s color in the way it had originally been presented in true technicolor gave way to a eastman color process in the middle s both kino and samuel goldwyn reissued the film both theatrically and on video but the eastman color prints were more pastel in nature and muted the vibrancy of the original technicolor the laser disc release of this title also has the pastel look to it nice but not as it should be now comes the m g m dvd dec issue the thief of bagdad again has the wonderful technicolor look to it on a dvd that is nothing short of stunning it was so exciting to see it like this once again that after viewing the dvd once i watched it a second time the only extras are a spanish dubbed version sub titles in both english spanish and a beautifully done original theatrical trailer thank you m g m for this exceptional dvd release now one can only hope that korda s four feathers and a restored version of korda s jungle book to replace to poor public domain prints in circulation will soon follow on dvd
this rather poorly named western series won an emmy for best syndicated program and is certainly an interesting series it was produced by republic the studio which did action better than anyone and they put their best into it each episode was built around a real historical figure of the old west a railroad detective named matt clark similar to the later elliot ness with the gangsters of the s and s managed to become involved with almost every notorious western outlaw between the middle of the s and wwi the series best asset was jim davis tall rugged ruggedly good looking in prime shape with an authentic western accent and great riding skills which made him utterly convincing in the action scenes davis was every inch the western hero he was teamed with two lovely and active co stars mary castle as frankie during the first season and kristine miller as jonesy during the second each worked well with davis what separated this show from its contemporaries and much of what came later was the professionalism invested in the action scenes ace action directer william witney directed episodes franklin adreon the rest both filmed the action with polish republic s vast store of stock footage from serials and b s was utilized to give scope the level of individual episodes rose or fell with the quality of the guest stars brought in to the play the outlaws among the really good ones were marie windsor as belle starr lee van cleef as jesse james fess parker as grat dalton jean parker as cattle kate and joe sawyer and slim pickins as butch cassady and the smilin kid the cream of the western up and comers pickins parker denver pyle james best and richard jaeckel honed their craft b veterans with decades of experience under their belts harry woods glenn strange kenneth macdonald earle hodgkins steve darrell and chief yowlachie provided the old leather feel of vintage westerns the weakness of the concept was that there are only so many famous western outlaws by the second season the famous figures were becoming a mite obscure for all by the most dedicated history buff nevertheless a few of the later shows were a match for any due to the guest stars henry brandon portrayed rustler nate champion and former republic star don barry was outstanding as small time outlaw milt sharp western fans or history buffs will want to see this
i sense out there a mix of confusion and varying degrees of personal taste in the reactions to this film yes there are vampire stereotypes yes there are scientific stereotypes covered here even martial arts stereotypes all well and good and sure not all perfectly done however i sense one crucial point about this film is being overlooked the cultural significance of its location the film is set in pensacola florida and does not try to avoid saying so that s a bold move in the film world today and a rare treat for fans of indy films and indeed it may not be the last pensacola is world renowned as a navy town an aviation town a lumber town and sometimes even as a hotbed for political controversy rarely is it seen as a growing film town but that s all changing now more film companies are coming in to shoot and more native pensacolians are discovering the power of cinema for themselves this film is part of a growing trend of pensacola based indy films and more are on the way pensacola is making a big noise in the global film community and by and by the world is taking more notice watch and listen world the pensacolians are coming like a virus
i heard tell that madonna was briefly considered for the catherine tremell role compared to sharon stone madonna is too coarse and bauerisch she s not even close evil incarnate sharon stone is a bit long in the tooth the ameliorative effects of modern chemistry and surgery notwithstanding however she artfully treats us to a frightening personification of evil beyond redemption in the obligatory sex scene she projects pure crystalline lust especially her hooded luminous eyes and a face flat with pleasure thanks to brilliant use of lighting and other stage techniques the harsh lines of age are only occasionally manifest rather she seems to have a slight golden glow yes yeats the locations gave us a view of london that is a welcome departure from the usual londonscapes the catherine character is so powerful and menacing that i thank my lucky stars that our paths never crossed i wouldn t have had a chance the original basic instinct attempts at censorship i must briefly comment on the original film set in san francisco a beautiful city worthy of this film it is outstanding from the music to the locations to the sets and so on paul verhoven pulled striking performances out of the cast and crew that the main baddie was a woman did not escape the scrutiny of bay area gay and lesbian activist groups attempts at censorship were vehemently denied swell these philosophical pygmies demanded editorial control over the script insisting on re writes that would promote their political and psychiatrically driven agendas example sanctimoniously alleging sexism and misogyny they demanded that the lead role be switched from bad girl to bad guy on locations in san francisco the gentle tolerant activists did their best to sabotage filming of the scenes with noise flashing lights and other tactics the executive producers mario kassar and andrew vajna vowed to fight any efforts to restrict the artistic freedom guaranteed in our democracy and obtained restraining orders against the disruptive tactics blowback thanks to the fulminating activists the film got huge national press coverage millions of dollars worth of free advertising their calls for viewers to boycott the film resulted in a backlash that had customers waiting in long lines wherever the film was launched it also received widespread critical acclaim it was in the words of the reptilian hackett in network a big titted hit sorry gentle reader i just couldn t resist that one yes it s a gibe in conclusion i believe that both basic instinct and with their brilliant musical scores aesthetics and acting are works of art that deserve protection under our constitution
very slight spoiler this movie despite being only on tv is absolutely excellent i didn t really pay attention to the differences in looks or accents so i can t really comment on that the acting in this was so good i had to pinch myself and say remember it s only a movie this didn t really happen as i sat and listened to harris and quinn talk i knew that it was exactly what john and paul would be talking about had they actually had this meeting the offhanded comments and burns from john were right on with his character especially in the restaurant as was his depression while paul was very easy going and laid back both actors did and excellent job and i was thrilled to have seen this movie it s a wicked experience for any beatles fan and prepare for a few surprises
i remember watching gung ho as a child with my mother and wondered why she would always cry in the last few minutes i of course found the entire movie hilarious particularly the mannerisms of the characters it wasn t until i was much older and watched it again that i realized how much deeper this show actually is michael keaton and gedde watanabe shine in their roles as the reluctant mediators keaton ceases to amaze me with his real life style of line delivery and watanabe adds humor and pathos to the mix i also thought that patti yasutake umeki was simply fabulous in her role as the comic relief i think this movie is one of the most underrated films of the s we can all learn a lesson from the merging of the american and japanese workers in this film sometimes you really can have the best of both worlds and now i understand why my mother felt the way she did in those closing moments i d rather have one of those cars too
this is not a love song is a brilliant example of the chase genre which many people think has an underlying meaning the love between the two main characters may be more than fraternal i believe that heaton is in love with spike but spike is too naive to see this i really feel this is portrayed with such scenes as the blow back and letter writing sequences heaton shows great intimacy towards spike with intense facial expressions and how he takes great care in writing spike s name on the top of his letters one thing i ve noticed when looking at external reviews is that when the film has been slated the reviewer seems to have not fully understood the film as they haven t even mentioned the possibility of heaton having sexual feelings for spike i also get the feeling that some of the reviewers haven t recognised it when they use phrases like who is heaton what s he doing with a retard like spike this person however may have hit the nail on the head with their remark spike shows noticeable signs of having a d d although i don t think this person has realised this as he seems to be using the word retard as a derogatory term i really enjoyed this film although it is not for the faint hearted the film is exceedingly character based after the shooting until the end there isn t much but dialogue between the two anti heroes unless you are used to watching such deep gritty films stay well away
i saw this movie about a year ago and found it to be completely laugh out loud funny a real winner in my mind it had the underlining of a stupid comedy but indeed had an actual plot as well much like the hit comedy elf in fact it had a few serious moments sandwiched between hilarity when stiller shot black s horse an ordinarily sober moment you found yourself laughing at his bumbling antics you can actually find common ground there as i m sure many people have done something they wouldn t want a friend to find out about lest your friendship should end when i found out how much people disliked this movie i was completely dumbfounded that absolutely terrible movies like napoleon dynamite had ratings higher than it makes me wonder about the sanity of people on imdb take my advice and rent it if you don t find yourself laughing at least once i ll compensate you the rental fee d
brian dennehy bill paxton joe pantalino and best of all jeff fahey all in one film wow is all i can think to say about that these are four of the most underrated actors in the biz and they work beautifully together it s like poetry the way they play off each other and ooze the natural ability to seem as though they had been best buddies for eons for even shooting the film the film itself is fine and one that can be quite intense to view the first time and the four stars help the re watch ability to a great extent i cannot describe how good it was to see bill paxton and jeff fahey together on screen the greatest moment being when they watch a couple from a distance and fill in the vocals themselves it almost brought a tear to my eyes a good film a great cast go see why four words fahey dennehy paxton pantalino
when it comes to the erotic genre i m lucky to get through the first minutes of the plot without getting up or looking for something else to watch this movie is different julie davis i love you don t touch me directed two very strong lead actors kira reed and doug jeffery in this enthralling thriller kira is convincing as kim a sweet innocent romance novelist that gets caught in the web of seduction of doug jeffery s the man a handsome stranger kira loses control of her inhibitions in the role and as actress giving what could have been simply another t and a depth and believability i believe it to be her best performance yet and julie davis direction is a great gift to erotica
for all the homicide junkies out there this movie was great every single character that ever was on the show made an appearance in the movie it helped to resolve some but not all issues from the series unfortunately unless you actually did watch the series most of the enjoyment would be lost as the movie made heavy references to every season of the show s existence this probably would have been appropriate as a series finale as opposed to being a separate movie but we gotta take what we can get i hope they make more movies and continue to feature homicide characters on law and order
i have to be honest and say i bought this movie not because of the content but because david cubitt is in it i know shallow or what but come on mr cubitt is a fantastic actor to put it mildly i really didn t know what to expect from watching this movie i d read the other write up and those on other sites but i have to say i was drawn into the world of the brothers almost from the get go david cubitt as theo and colm feore as ryan are so believable as the two estranged brothers the film moves through their relationship as they start to try getting to know each other again after their fathers death the scene where theo finds out ryan is gay was played brilliantly he literally walks in on a scene and tries to leave without ryan noticing which of course he has the film has been very well researched and is therefore incredibly sad moving uplifting and a celebration of life in parts i came away from this feeling sad at what ryan went through but also with the knowledge that he was given hope and unconditional love by the ex drug addict brother theo i agree with the other reviewer who finds the scene where theo says he will be a father moving and i d go a little further to say i actually vocalised my thoughts at ryan when he cruelly says to theo what makes you think you can be a father and theo says simply you theo walks away then but that small exchange of dialogue speaks volumes to the almost self pitying aspect of ryan who is brought up sharply by the simple retort a brilliantly conceived movie on all counts the acting directing writing etc are all so well done i can t really find anything else to say about this movie except to say that it is very hard dealing with the death of a loved one but this is done superbly to the infinite degree the respect for the subject matter and the outpouring of love without being contrite and mawkish speaks volumes in this rather selfish world we live in today well done to all concerned not many movies bring me to tears and give me pause to think about life in general and also to be glad for all the things i have and not be sad for the things i don t but this movie did it was unbelievably uplifting considering the subject matter
i m a fan of crash and blade runner and this movie explores some of those highway death and s film noir themes that i like to see so i enjoyed it in general though the essential stupidity of the film noir protagonist is not pulled off well by the female lead and her hero is nearly a neanderthal hence the kitch warning
castle of blood is a good example of the quality work in the horror genre being turned out in italy in the s the film has all of the right elements old dark house atmosphere a decent story and barbara steele steele makes most any film worth seeing the story concerns a haunted castle people have visited but none have returned our hero makes a wager that he can spend the night in the castle and return to collect his winnings but the night he visits is a special night it s the night each year when the dead return to relive their deaths the only flaw i see in the movie is the running time it almost feels padded there is a large portion of the first act where literally nothing happens our hero stumbles around in the dark finding nothing of interest but once he does find something the movie picks up and become quite enjoyable castle of blood is a definite must for steele fans and fans of italian gothic horror in general
three horror stories based on members of a transgressive hindu cult that return home but changed in some way in the first story our former cult member is now in an insane asylum and is visited by a reported who wants to find out about what went on at the cult somewhat slow going as story is told in flashbacks while the two sit on chairs and face each other reporter is particularly interested in what lead to the death of the participants what seemed rather boring suddenly turns very exciting with a surprising twist in the story things get quite bloody second story has a violent young criminal visiting a psychiatrist for mandatory therapy the patient seems to have some type of agenda but the psychiatrist is up to the task again things slow down a bit and get weird then there s a strange twist in the story that is very well written and surprising final story deals with spiritual healer who claims to be able to remove the persons illness from them with his hands one of the patients is a former cult member so the successful healing gets more complicated again we are surprised by a twist has a pretty gory scene in there there some nice female full frontal nudity as well as male full frontal nudity for some reason i found the stories to be very well written and the director succeeds entirely in setting up each story with its surprising twist and the gory aftermath note review of the german dvd
i saw this movie as a kid on creature feature when i lived in new york it was a pretty creepy movie though not as good as horror hotel i just bought this movie on dvd and it is different from what i remember because in the dvd that i bought there are several scenes where the actors speak in french and or italian and no subtitles are provided then the other actors respond in english to what was being said kind of weird also on the dvd box the names of some of the actors are spelled differently than on imdb aside from that this movie is different in that the character of elsie takes her clothes off and provides a nude shot in one scene and in another scene julia tries to force elizabeth barbara steele to make out with her by pushing her down on the bed and kissing her while steele resists that scene existed in the tv version but it was very edited i wonder if there is any extra footage that could be incorporated into a remastered ultra edition it seems sad that some of these old low budget classics have been spliced to bits and sold in all kinds of edited versions where are the master tapes and all the unused footage aside from the first boring twenty minutes before allen is delivered to the castle the rest of the movie is pretty good there aren t too many special effects but herbert s face after julia clubs him is a good one the creepy atmosphere and the strange exotic and seductive look of barbara steele make the movie a lot better than it should be i can honestly say that if barbara steele had not been in this film it would be a big zero she makes the movie a ten
a meteor crashes into crater lake the heat from the impact causing a prehistoric egg to hatch alright so the plot is just trash but despite its obvious low budget this comes across as one of the most gripping and entertaining monster on the loose films in existence there are also some good moments of humor in an age filled so called monsters which are no more than laughable men in rubber suit creations or lizards dressed up in frills and forced to rip each other to pieces cheap exploitation style it s refreshing to discover that the plesiosaur in this little gem is an excellent harryhausen style stop motion creature quite a hard film to find but it s worth finding
i really liked this movie it was good and the actors were brilliant leon robinson who played richard and many other classic singers is very good at his job when you see him in a musical movie you know that it is going to be good i would suggest that people watch this heart warming sad and special movie if they want to know more about richard outstanding fresh
it s been a long time since i saw this mini series and i am happy to say its remembered merits have withstood the test of time most of the components of a perfect spy the adaptation of lecarr s finest novel in my opinion are top drawer outstanding aspects of it are the musical score and the masterful screenplay the latter written by arthur hopcraft who was also i believe the screenwriter for tinker tailor soldier spy with alec guinness a few years before the actors are mostly very good some superb like alan howard s jack brotherhood and ray mcanally s ricky pym peter egan is fascinating to watch because his face changes with every camera angle the passage of time and the effects upon the physical appearances of the characters is very believably done so much so that i wondered exactly how old peter egan was at the time of filming the only jolt comes after the character of magnus pym is transferred from the very able hands of a young actor named benedict taylor to those of a noticeably too old peter egan just fresh out of oxford but this is a minor and unimportant seam in the whole egan has trouble being convincing only when the text becomes melodramatic and he needs to be upset emotionally ie cry none of the actors have a very easy time with these moments aside from the wonderful frances tomelty who plays peggy wentworth for all she s worth and steals the episode with ease jane booker is annoying as mary pym she has part of the character under her skin but often displays an amateurish petulance that diminishes her as a tough cookie diplomatic housewife which mary pym is r diger weigang is splendid as axel amusing ironic and brilliant i also enjoyed sarah badel s camp turn as the baroness the british view of americans is vividly rendered in some dryly hilarious scenes when the yanks have come abroad to confab with bo brammell head of mi the american contingent are portrayed as empty headed buffoons who appear to have memorized a lot of long words out of the dictionary and spiced them liberally with american jargon and psycho babble much to the bemused scorn of the english the humor and sadness are subtly blended lecarr has a knack for mixing disparate elements in his stories and hopcraft has brilliantly captured the melancholy yet wistful atmosphere of the original not a perfect production what is and yet the best of the lecarr adaptations to reach film or television to date highly recommended to all spy thriller lovers and especially lecarr fans dvd available from acorn
i enjoyed this movie and after watching it it made me wonder just how many caitlin rose s exist in the world how many other girls have been subjected to this sort of sexual abuse and torment by classmates and have been too frightened to open their mouth about it just how threatening and cruel can teenagers be towards one another because as this film demonstrates who s right is not foremost important its who is popular and feared which manipulates the minds of youths and influences them to allow this sort of immorality to happen tiffani amber thiessen gives a powerful performance as the rape victim and brian austin green is convincing as the guy torn between the girl he thought he loved and his best friend this is the kind of film that doesn t get the exposure it deserves remarkable and brilliant too good to be just a film made for tv
one of disney s best films that i can enjoy watching often you may easily guess the outcome but who cares its just plain fun escape for hour forty two minutes and after all wasn t movies meant to get away from reality for just a short time anyway the cast sparkles with delight magictrain
this game ranks above all so far i had the honor of playing mine on ps so the graphics were really good the voice acting was above standard the difficulty level is just right wesker has to be the best characters in the re series in my opinion the story amazed me and took many different twist that i wasn t expecting the only rating this game deserves is great
this film was amazing it had an original concept that of a vampire movie meets yakuza mob film it is a humorous and yet highly dramatic and tragic movie about friendship love immortality death and happiness and comments subtelly on society on the part of gackt camui the role of sho was excellently delivered and hyde was surprisingly good for his first film as the tortured yet humorous vampire kei i also laughed and cried at the happy go lucky character toshi who grew up with sho i loved each and every second of this this film especially moments such as the funny cigarette scene the fighting scenes and most of all the heartrenching ending
this movie is an awesome non stop laugh riot incorporating all the usual ingredients of a dawid dhawan comedy bumbling heroes buffoonish supporting characters made up dolls for heroines nasty villains wisecracks rocking soundtrack choreography and a little dose of action amitabh bachchan and govinda both are in double roles of policemen and conmen the heroine of amitabh the cop is ramya krishnan and raveena is opposite govinda the cop heroines are mere rouge smothered props as usual the conmen have no heroines paresh rawal carries his villainous act in daud forward he played a similar don in khoobsurat too asrani shines in a brief role he does a retake on his famous angrezon ke zamaane ke jailer act in sholay govinda is impeccable as usual as a wisecracking good humoured policeman pyaare mohan and as a conman chhote miyaan he imitates bihari style of hindi speaking with hilarious results amitabh bachchan believe it or not pales in comparison with him but still ab is fine madhuri dixit does a cameo as herself in the song makhna she dances like wind viju shah s music is awesome check out kisi disco mein jaayen makhna and the title track do not go looking for any logic since it is a comedy and the screenplay is of convenience completely just enjoy yourself
george raft as steve brodie the carefree dancing gambler who can never refuse a dare is pitted against the lumbering sentimental chuck connors wallace beery a soft touch for every panhandler connors impulsively adopts waifs and strays notably runaway orphan swipes jackie cooper complete with kittens and the homeless lucy calhoun an out of town innocent with ambitions to become a writer in this male dominated culture communication takes place mostly in the form of violence one sees why the bowery is a martin scorsese favorite exploding cigars provide a running gag swipes enjoys throwing rocks through windows in chinatown on one occasion setting a laundry alight the simultaneous arrival of both brodie s and beery s volunteer fire companies leads to a brawl during which the building burns to the ground beery casually saps a troublesome girl and thumps anyone who disagrees with him including brodie whom he defeats in a night time fist fight on a moored barge to regain control of his saloon lost on a bet that brodie wouldn t have the courage to jump off the brooklyn bridge brodie does make the leap but only because a subterfuge with a dummy fails at the last moment as usual walsh fills the frame with detail illustrating with relish the daily life of the tenderloin singing waiters bullying barmen whores from suicide hall being hustled into the black maria tailors collaring hapless hicks off the street and forcing them to buy suits they don t want a minor but admirable little film
the premise for this movie is simple and so is the script an elderly muslim gets his teenage son to drive him in his similarly elderly station wagon from france to the haj in mecca saudi arabia so that he can fulfill his holy muslim obligation before he dies the father is clearly devoutly religious but the son is unimpressed he accepts out of obligation to his father rather than to religion he d rather be with his non muslim girlfriend the father is stubborn in a lot of things which the son doesn t understand and the petulance between them is the device that maintains the drama although it is often rather irksome however like any good road movie there are oddball characters encountered along the way for example a woman on a backroad in croatia who upon being asked for directions to belgrade simply gets in the backseat and points with her hand uttering one word which they assume to be a place but can t find it on the map in bulgaria another man they ask directions of confirms he can speak french but then provides an extensive commentary in bulgarian there is also occasional humor in one country the son tires of eating egg sandwiches and wants meat they are given a goat but unfortunately perhaps fortunately for the viewer it runs away before the father can perform the muslim slaughterman ritual they eventually make it to mecca the muslim equivalent of the vatican but on a much grander scale for westerners it is all bizarre but fascinating the movie isn t sophisticated but is charming in its own way a kind of national geographic with soul
though structured totally different from the book by tim krabb who wrote the original the vanishing spoorloos it does have the same overall feel except for that koolhoven s style is less business like and more lyric the beginning is great the middle is fine but the sting is in the end a surprise emotional ending as you could read in several magazines there is some sex in the film but it is done all very beautifully never explicit but with lots of warmth and sometimes even humour it is a shame american films can t be as open an honoust as this one where dutch films tend to go just over the edge when it comes to this subject de grot stays always within the boundaries of good taste de grot tells an amazing story stretched over more than years when you ll leave the cinema you ll be moved what can we ask more of a film anyway this film even gives more
i just recently watched this movie starring vincent price for the first time on turner classic movies price portrays don gallico a magician inventor who is driven to murder when his boss steals several of his magical inventions and also his wife portrayed in a brief role by the lovely eva gabor even though price is a murderer i actually found myself rooting for him he is a sympathetic character who is driven mad by the greedy people around him who keep taking advantage of him although this movie doesn t have the horror factor of some of his more famous roles such as my favorite house of wax it nonetheless has enough going for it to keep the viewers interest this is a must for vincent price fans
not having read nabokov and knowing nothing about chess i could only view the luzhin defence as a movie it works really well as one of my favorite genres sports romances the chess comes alive as a tough competition much more than in say searching for bobby fischer in showing just how much hard mental work the game can be requiring thought preparation stamina and planning i particularly liked the special effects on the chess board as alternative plays are anticipated through the feminist director maureen gorris of antonia emily watson with her big blue eyes gradually strengthens via her transformative relationship with john turturro s fairly one note absent minded intense chess genius the settings in italy and hungary are beautiful originally written
i must warn you there are some spoilers in it but to start it off i got spanish judges on february i think it was mention it was the last copy but as i see it wasn t back ordered but either way i have it i thought it was good i wanted to see this mainly because of the great actor matthew lillard i m surprised no one on the reviews mention the scar although it is kind of low budget getting enough money to make this film would be worth spending man what a good actor the story it about a con artist known as jack matthew lillard who claims to have merchandises called the spanish judges if you don t know what spanish judges are or haven t seen the trailer for this and this is the first review you have read i won t even say what they are i figure it would be a big twist of no one knew what it was he needs protection so he hires a couple who are also crooks max and jamie vincent d onofrio and valeria golino as well as a crook that goes by the name of piece mark boone junior he has a girlfriend who won t even tell anyone her name because she s from mars as she said so they mainly jack call her mars girl everything starts out fine but then it turns to one big game a game that involves some lust lies and betrayal there was some over acting in it matt and valeria as well as tamara were not one of them there were some scenes they could ve done better and the score could ve been a little better as well some of the score was actually good the theme they used for the beginning and the end before the credits was a good song choice that s my opinion the fight scene in the end could ve been a little longer and a little more violent but what can you do one more comment on matt damn he plays a smooth slick con man i know this is a review but i need to make a correction towards necro one of the reviewers valeria golino is not a newcomer according to this site she has been acting since to me and hopefully to others she is well known as charlie sheen s italian love interest in both the hot shots movies but good review although i think it s one of the rare films i ve seen and it s really good which is why i gave it stars above i will give the grade of what i thought when i first saw it
saw this today with my year old i thought it was cute i agree with the other poster that it wasn t anything like the book that i can remember but we still enjoyed it all of the kids are pretty good and all in all pretty entertaining billy is the new kid who accepts a dare by the school bully to eat worms in a day if he loses he has to walk down the hall at school with worms in his pants the beginning of the movie is set up to show that billy has a very weak stomach and pukes at almost anything hilarity ensues with a bunch of different way to cook the worms good message about standing up to bullies and of course a sappy happy ending
this film quite literally has every single action movie cliche and all of them work to its advantage straight from lethal weapon gary busey wisecracks shoots and chuckles through this film with such reckless abandonment it can t help but amuse and entertain there are tanks helicopters machine gun battles grenades and ice cream vans and if they aren t good enough reasons to watch this film then how about the best one danny trejo and if you don t know who danny trejo is then you probably won t like this film
this film tells the story of a romance between albert einstien niece and a gas station attendant in order to get the two together einstien agrees to help ed hudsucker proxy s tim robbins learn to act more intelligent this impresses catherine meg ryan unfortunately einstien goes too far and ed is considered to be a genius hilarity ensues not to be missed filmed in mercer county new jersey at princeton university lawrenceville prep school doubling for princeton university as well as a beautiful vintage gas station in hopewell
xiao chen zhi chun is a great movie not only in the year it was shot but also now it s an art movie which is not outdated even in st century the director maintained a good narrative skill and thus made the story so smooth the movie reminds me of the later french new wave movie francois truffaut s femme d a cote which is of the similar topic
this is not a bad movie it follows the new conventions of modern horror that is the movie within a movie the well known actress running for her life in the first scene this movie takes the old convention of a psycho killer on he loose and manage to do something new and interesting with it it is also always nice to see molly ringwald back for the attack so this might be an example of what the genre has become cut hits all the marks and is actually scary in some parts i liked it i gave it an eight
this was a great movie with a good cast all of them hitting on all cylinders and when dianne keaton is at her best well it just doesn t get any better than that but tom everett scott always underrated was even better he should be a star my only complaint is with one aspect of the screenplay none of the characters ever acknowledged that the dead daughter wasn t always a good person and neither was her mother played by keaton at one point she breaks a promise she made to one character not to reveal that he had been sleeping around one of the other commentators said the movie had a political agenda that is a baffling thing to say there was no politics at all in this movie
this is easily the most underrated film inn the brooks cannon sure its flawed it does not give a realistic view of homelessness unlike say how citizen kane gave a realistic view of lounge singers or titanic gave a realistic view of italians you idiots many of the jokes fall flat but still this film is very lovable in a way many comedies are not and to pull that off in a story about some of the most traditionally reviled members of society is truly impressive its not the fisher king but its not crap either my only complaint is that brooks should have cast someone else in the lead i love mel as a director and writer not so much as a lead
let s eliminate any discussion about the use of non asian actors playing asian roles the movie is years old in studio chiefs believed that any actor could should be able to play any role actors were under contracts and did not always have a choice about what role they played end of story this is a truly great epic story of love individual rights class strata and men women issues the centerpiece of the film is two brilliant performances by luise rainer and paul muni muni plays wang a chinese farmer who is about to take a wife rainer from the start he treats her with respect during a time when women were looked on as little more than hired help without giving too much of the movie away they go through the highs and lows of all relationships and even though the story may take place in late th early th century the story and much of their feelings seems credible other than the fact that the movie is about minutes longer than it needs to be and the performances of charley grapewin and walter connolly are typical s cartoon characters this is a really wonderful movie that unfortunately has become a victim of political correctness out of
this is a thoroughly diabolical tale of just how bad things can go wrong a simple robbery pick up some serious change get our finances together and everything will be hunky dory but mom and pop s jewelry store no problem insurance pays for it all no guns nobody gets hurt easy money older more successful it would appear brother andy philip seymour hoffman has a few minor problems heroin addiction cocaine habituation a wife marisa tomei that well he can t seem to perform for his flat belly days long gone younger sweet slightly dim witted younger brother hank ethan hawke with a few dinero problems of his own behind in child support payments for his daughter in debt to friends and relatives not exactly wowing them in the work of work etc sydney lumet in this performance at the age of directs and gets it percent right which is hard to do in a thriller i have seen more thrillers than i can remember and most of the time the director gets the movie printed and lives with the plot holes the improbabilities the cheesy scenes and the hurry up ending here lumet makes a thriller like it s a work of art every detail is perfect the acting is superb the plot has no holes the story rings true and clear and represents a tale about human frailty that would honor the greatest filmmakers and even the bard himself hoffman of course is excellent when you don t have marquee leading man presence you have to get by on talent workmanship and pure concentration ethan hawke who is no stranger to the sweet little guy role adds a layer of desperation and all too human incompetence to the part so that we don t know whether to pity him or trash him albert finney plays the father of the wayward sons with a kind of steely intensity that belies his age and marisa tomei who has magical qualities of sexiness to go along with her unique creativity manages to be both vulnerable and hard as nails as andy s two timing wife but who could blame her it s almost a movie reviewer s sacrilege to give a commercial thriller five or ten stars but if you study this film as all aspiring film makers would be well advised to do you will notice the kind of excessive according to most hollywood producers attention to detail that makes for real art the sort of thing that only great artists can do and indeed cannot help but do by the way i think there were twenty producers on this film well maybe a dozen check the credits all i can say in summation is way to go sydney lumet author of a slew of excellent films and to show such fidelity to your craft and your art at such an advanced age kudos may we all do half so well okay the percent it was unlikely that the father albert finney could have followed the cabs that andy took around new york without somehow losing the tail this is minor and i wish all thrillers could have so small a blip also one wonders why lumet decided not to tell us about the fate of hank at the end we can guess and guess perhaps his fate fell onto the cutting room floor perhaps lumet was not satisfied with what was filmed and time ran out and he just said leave it like that it really doesn t matter and i think it doesn t what happens to hank is not going to be good he isn t the kind of guy who manages to run off to mexico and is able to start a new life he is the kind of guy who gets a light sentence of to and serves it and comes out a kind of shrunken human being who knows he wasn t really a man when he should have been see this for sidney lumet one of hollywood s best director of the pawnbroker the group serpico dog day afternoon network and many more
hmmmm want a little romance with your mystery this has it i think if the romance was ditched this would have made for a better movie but how could the romance be ditched when the story s borrowed from something called a harlequin romance novel whatever the heck that is had the romance been ditched the story might have been a little too weak the mystery here wasn t too bad quite interesting but nothing on the level of mission impossible international espionage oh well i thought mel harris was pretty good her short skirts i think added some sex appeal but this rob stewart guy probably could have been better cast maybe with a more well known tv movie actor the directing was decent and the writing could have been improved on both could have been a little edgier a little darker more adventurous one thing that was great about this was the use of real european locations that could easily have been changed so this could have been filmed in canada but they really were in magnificently beautiful places like budapest possibly a drawback was the director and or cinematographer s choice to frame certain shots picture postcard perfect not good had this been a more dramatic motion picture shot for the big screen picture postcard perfect scenes really need to take a backseat and just be a nice part of the background this was just a tv movie though so they had to add some ummmph to the picture and some of that ummmph came from the scenery overall twasn t really a bad movie i ll tell you what this was absolutely the best canadian hungarian production i have ever seen and the only that i know of i hereby proclaim this to be a mediocre made for tv movie giving it a grade of c
firstly i really enjoyed this movie and its message which is about daring to live life to the fullest very poetic with heartwarming and funny and sad scenes very lively it was a pleasure to watch here are my exceptions though the movie was way too long and at some point it kept adding more and more additional conflicts so that it started to lose the main story line i disagree though with another comment that its unrealistic to have so many people with strange problems in such a small village i think this was absolutely realistic there are incredible dramas going on everywhere we just don t know this about people we meet only superficially i disliked the ending which was so loaded with symbolism and extremely forced it left a bad taste as it was just too much i did not like it that so many big issues were dramatically mentioned in the group when some accused others in front of everyone else of major things people would just be more ashamed to voice everything so personal in front of everybody even if those people are a group one is closely working with and defending oneself is a human beings strongest instinct so why on earth would daniel let himself be beaten and never fight back not even to defend himself i mean he was not weak he could at least try to defend himself when attacked but it just drove me mad to see him do nothing it was as if the storyteller tried to forcefully bring across a message like violence is not needed but the way he chose to do this was not good i am also against violence but the character loses credibility when he stays unmoved despite all the attacks and gabriella why on earth would a woman who has spent years with a man beating her up go to that man when he gets arrested and say i do not wish you any harm you have just done your best like all of us oh really this spoiled so much was she going to be a saint or what it would be normal for her to be bitter but not so almost holy and therefore not human was her work with daniel and the music so great that it made her forget all of the s t that happened to her oh please so these were the spoiling moments nevertheless i still think this is a delightful movie all in all which is amazing enough given my discomfort with quite a few things watch it
family is about two families who are after each other s blood viren sahay amitabh bachchan is an underworld don operates from bangkok he has a family in india once by mistake he kills shekhar akshay kumar like viren sahay he also has a family a brother wife and parents aryan aryaman shekhar s brother is out to take revenge of his brother s death he kidnaps viren sahay s family for the same reason the film has got one turning point amitabh bachchan second half of the movie belongs to him completely where instead of his dialogs expression matters more akshay s minuscule role has also put him at par with amitabh i didn t understand what bhumika chawala was doing in this movie there were a few loose points in the script like amitabh has been shown as the most wanted criminal of the city still he walks scot free in the city kidnapping of his family is also seemed vague how can the family of such a big don doesn t have any security cover
there s no romance or other side plot to this movie it s action and intrigue all the way making it a real man s kung fu movie an aging master dispatches his last disciple yan tieh to stop his five former pupils who s styles represents five venomous animals centipede snake scorpion lizard and the toad despite the word venom in the title none of these pupil uses venoms to kill their opponents yan tieh told by his teacher that he s no match for the five former pupil must find one he can form an alliance with to defeat the other four how yan tieh and the others find each other is the intrigue to the story with good kung fu action spread out throughout the story recognized as a cult classic this movie has already established itself in the annals of kung fu action movies it s known well enough that other movies make reference to the five styles depicted in this story it s no artistic masterpiece with the usual bad dubbing and corny acting but the movie is one of the best of its kind because its so focused on the all the ingredients of kung fu action movie of its time and gives an extra concentrated dose of them one movie you must watch if you are a kung fu movie fan
no rubbish no where even near rubbish not an original thats the last thing that could be said of children predictable certainly not although it was somewhat an unusual series for the bbc it was hilarious funny and witty i particularly liked belinda lang and john pickard who i believe preformed wonderfully gary olsen was also very good and so were all the other cast members i never quite new why it was can celled till reading here today about gary olsen s death at a relatively young age i do wish that they would make more of comedy of this type much more of them and show them here in israel thumbs way up
some years ago satellite channel u k gold promoted repeats of men behaving badly with the hype here it is the original flat sharing sitcom this was in fact untrue man about the house was also a flat sharing sitcom and ran from it was the brainchild of johnnie mortimer and brian cooke creators of the popular sitcom father dear father when it ended they decided they wanted to do something more in harmony with the times in the first episode chrissy paula wilcox and jo sally thomsett are tidying their myddleton terrace flat following a wild party when they find a man in their bath he is robin tripp richard o sullivan a southampton cookery student of no fixed abode while his clothes dry out he puts on a ladies dressing gown and prepares them a meal they are so impressed by his culinary skills that they invite him to stay but there must be no naughty business so robin has to pretend to be gay on b b c s i love shown in julie burchill claimed that house showed her a way of life she envied she was not alone one of the most iconic for me anyway images of s british television was sally thomsett coming out of the london underground carrying a parasol and a blind man doing a double take as her pert bottom swings past a man living with two girls was a risqu subject for the time but mrs mary whitehouse had no need to get hot under the collar it was innocent good natured fun mortimer and cooke s scripts went as close as they could to the edge without crossing it richard o sullivan was still playing bingham in i t v s doctor in charge when this got started in fact the second run of in charge overlapped with the first of house he was born to play the sex mad robin paula wilcox s chrissy was more streetwise than beryl her character she played in the lovers while sally thomsett s jo was a lovable dizzy blonde as time wore on he became almost like an older brother to them for many viewers brian murphy and yootha joyce stole the show as the warring ropers george had lost interest in sex but mildred had not they went on to their own show the aptly titled george mildred the late doug fisher was good value as as robin s wideboy friend larry he worked so well he was made into a regular within a year of its debut there was the inevitable movie spin off i am not a big fan of the man about the house movie because i think it was stretched to fit the big screen most of its characters had never appeared in the series the format was sold to america where it became the long running three s company starring the late john ritter and suzanne somers it was far more suggestive than the british original with somers often seen in sexy clothing after six seasons house ended with chrissy marrying robin s older brother norman norman eshley fans were devastated to see robin failing to get the girl he loved but there was some consolation in the fact that he too landed his own show robin s nest
i disagree with anyone who done t like this movie i used to love this movie when i was little and i still do it s sweet funny and warms your heart and it proves that love and friendship can never be destroyed and even though it didn t have much of a story it was still excellent i give it a and two thumbs up oh yeah and it proves that your deepest wish s and dreams can come true tear tear i love this movie personally if anyone says it sucked than i will say shame on you because it was a delightful little movie and i m glad that at least some people liked it
i thought king solomon s mines was beautifully done my only reservation was alison doody her acting was superb but her makeup and hair was not of the period and always seemed to make her look out of place next to the other actors i thought patrick swayze was an excellent choice for alan quatermain it was nice seeing a seasoned rugged looking actor in this role after sitting through movie after movie with the fair haired fair skinned actors like val kilmer brad pitt etc he was an excellent choice and i enjoyed every minute of this movie this version cannot be compared with the s version with stewart grainger it was a big screen movie and not a made for tv movie i thought both quatermains were believable but the two medias have to be kept separated i am looking forward to seeing this once more and i hope patrick swayze will again look to these type of roles
there have been a lot of zorro films made over the decades but it s a shame that one of the best is probably one of the least seen zorro s fighting legion is a bit different from other zorro films first off it s a republic serial in chapters and this time zorro is not played by a top studio star like douglas fairbanks tyrone power or antonio banderas but instead by workman like actor reed hadley while hadley does not cast as strong a presence over the proceedings as those other he does an adequate job helped by the fact that he is not the sole hero here as the title implies he has a fighting legion to call upon another big difference is that the setting isn t california the story here take place in central mexico in where a man posing as a living god incites the indigenous indian population and a band of outlaws to aid him in his plan to overthrow the newly established mexican republic something zorro and a handful of followers plan to do anything they can to stop don t get me wrong there is at least one incredibly cheesy moment per episode from corny twang bow sound effects to ludicrous acting but overall this represents one of the best republic serials of all time and probably the best zorro one the plot is stronger than most serials and never becomes incomprehensible or meandering and there s lots of great action fans of the indiana jones movies will notice many bits borrowed from this serial
i ve just returned from a showing of my left foot at our public library what an emotional experience i feel drained and uplifted it s the story of christy brown irish writer and painter and based on the author s autobiographical my left foot christy was born with a form of cerebral palsy such that the only limb he had good control of was his left foot doctors advised his parents he was hopelessly mentally retarded but his mother didn t give up on him and somewhat as annie sullivan had done with helen keller helped him achieve a breakthrough in which he learned the alphabet and then to read write and paint this film won academy awards for daniel day lewis best actor as well as best supporting actress for the actress playing his mother it also received oscar nominations for best picture best director and best adapted screenplay as a retired clinical psychologist and family therapist while many films may entertain me many also often leave me having to overlook gross fictions or improbabilities in realistic psychological reactions not this film it was absolutely spot on in portraying typical irish parental roles behaviors see e g see typical irish families in mcgoldrick s ethnicity family therapy as well christy brown s uneven emotional maturation some immature personality reactions that were even further amplified by his picking up traits of his father the film presents the greater truth while changing certain sequences in his development painting writing and condensing several important people into one person for the sake of telling a coherent believable story not burdened by small distracting less important actualities see christy brown in wikipedia for more accuracy the dvd version we were shown had some english subtitles that were a great help in understanding christy s speech some of the irish speech the initial release of the film may have lacked this if you see this on dvd enable that option the performance by daniel day lewis is one of the greatest believable acting jobs i ve ever seen truly magnificent outstanding superlative my left foot bears more than some similarity to a more recent film the diving bell the butterfly in that each portrays the life of a real person successfully surmounting the imprisonment and isolation of an extremely severe physical handicap and in doing so it resonates with william ernest henley s invictus which begins out of the night that covers me black as the pit from pole to pole i thank whatever gods may be for my unconquerable soul
this is something new there s a coup d etat and a couple of irish documentary filmmakers are right inside of it a democratically elected president who uses his power to bring literacy to his people and encourages them to read the constitution is being slandered by the private media openly as dictator mentally unstable new hitler etc without repercussion from the governments side like say silencing them via bullets and other traditional dictatorial methods oh and they still claim that they are being suppressed of course see how the media gloats about their own role in the coup d etat on tv after they toppled the government with the help of rouge generals how much more stupid can you get and see how the people of venezuela march to the palace holding the constitution in their hands and reinstall their elected government this sounds like a hollywood fairytale but it happened for real against the explicit wishes of the usa the documentary is a historical masterpiece shot from the center of the action acute and totally embarrassing for the prime supporters of the coup the good democratic freedom loving benevolent usa who still channel large amounts of money to chavez political opponents also highly entertaining and exciting points
the endless bounds of our inhumanity to our own kind never fails to stun me this truly astonishing story of a horrifically abused and largely unheard of population is compelling well documented and enraging as an american i am constantly humiliated by my country s behaviour and this is just another in our long catalogue of international debasement we suck this is probably the first john pilger documentary i ve seen but it immediately made me want to see what else he s done my only complaint and the reason i gave this film only out of is that pilger shows us this travesty and the appalling collaboration of the us and uk governments demands that we viewers citizens are complicit in our own inaction but makes no suggestion of how to help i don t know about britain but america s made it nearly impossible for the citizenry to take part in their government s doings a gesture in the right direction might help these islanders cause
tony arzenta a sicilian hit man or professional killer decides to leave the business and his former employers do not agree in terms of content this highly enjoyable action movie doesn t have one in terms of sheer amusement it is fun it is very melodramatic violent quite brutal the car chases are notable arzenta is an unpretentious yet very likable film much better than the current hollywoodian trash that gets the same label it comes from delon s rather short flirting with the italian b cinema of the s it carefully uses delon s tough guy persona belonging to the gallery of bad ass thugs that he made in his youth i enjoyed very much the fact that delon made this film that he had a role in a good eurocrime flick the score is very fine with a good introductory song making felt that gusto that the italians had for the film considered as a synthetic work where the musical art has an important part in tony arzenta big guns no way out the very appealing erika blanc years in appears as an unnamed hooker meanwhile arzenta s girlfriend sandra is played by carla gravina a starlet that practically left the movies after arzenta is interestingly filmed an ambitious visual conception some expressionistic peculiar angles the movie was directed by the prolific duccio tessari the one who made also zorro the delon comedy needless to mention that these two films tony arzenta and zorro are very unlike the first one is a bloody melodramatic violent action movie the second is a lighthearted comedy more kindred to a spoof though remarkably coherent and skilfully made duccio tessari directed films like kiss kiss bang bang sons of satan the bloodstained butterfly viva la muerte tua tough guys safari express etc
i don t agree with one of the reviewers who compared this film to the american international pictures basil deardon has directed a brutally realistic film with an honest attempt to portray the rise of juvenile delinquency in post war england but without the sentimentality of blackboard jungle the cinematography was excellent as it really captured the scariness and isolation of the huge housing estate the estate looked like an old prison stanley baker was excellent as the hardened detective reassigned to the juvenile division urgent urgent larceny five iced lollies he finds he is the butt of many jokes david mccallum showed that he was one of britain s top young talents of the fifties he had a very different role in another stanley baker film hell drivers his portrayal of johnny and the fanatical following he inspired was very frightening ann heywood was also very good as the cynical cathie i wouldn t say there was a romantic subplot in it detective jack truman is investigating a string of arson attacks by someone labeled the firefly just as he finds evidence which could lead to a breakthrough he is assigned to the juvenile division he is pretty disgusted at what he feels is not proper police work amid all the heckling he gets his first call out the year old murphy twins are working a scam at the local lolly shops taking the twins home he meets their brother the charismatic johnny and their embittered sister cathie he starts to appreciate how life on the ghastly housing estates can turn young kids into criminals as he gets more involved with the family he realises there is a strong link between the fires johnny and a frightened chinese youth who works for a laundry the local priest peter cushing in an unusual role away from the hammer horrors explains that when johnny was younger he had rescued some people from a burning building and had been hailed a hero he wanted to recapture the feeling of importance and being useful and felt he could by lighting fires the school siege was filmed in a very real way and the viewer felt the children s fear the teacher thinking only of her own safety runs off and locks them in the room with the frightened gunman i thought it was a really excellent film that tried to show some of the social problems britain experienced after the war highly recommended
one of the best musicals ever made this is an example of where the producers and director were not afraid to pick actors for their talent rather than for what people might expect the lighting and set are unique giving it a very interesting effect this has a special name that i cannot think of the dialog is also unique in that no contractions are used the movie is well paced beautifully acted and interesting from start to finish a real joy is the music such an array of first rate songs from beginning to end that are perfectly performed and orchestrated also the music is very original and very memorable and i think superior to many musicals from the thirties through the sixties it certainly has more original and beautiful songs than most musicals that might have only two or three not bad for a director with no experience in this type of movie another quality is that it is fresh each time one sees it
this has to be the all time best computer animation classic even though most of the animations where experiments they have an artistic quality that has stood the test of time twelve years after it s release i have gone back to watch this video and found some inspiration for new types of computer graphics some of the techniques used in this video have never been full explored
i saw his movie in dallas texas when it came out in i remember them giving out prizes for showing up to see the movie after seeing the movie i can see why the movie was not bad nor was it great the problem with this movie was that it tried to tell a side story they created a new story new characters and tried to wrap it around the masters saga my biggest complaint is that the plot is about a second wave of robotech masters attacking the earth they even used the same scenes from the master saga but with different dialogue as a kid i loved the movie but unfortunately i haven t seen it as an adult and can t give a better review looking back i was disappointed but now i would love to see the movie and re evaluate my stance on it that being said will someone please release this movie for the whole world to judge i love robotech and can t wait for the shadows chronicles
for quite a long time in my life i either did not like this film or i liked this film but not as much as many more i watched it recently at a sleepover funnily enough and i liked it more than i had done since i was under or something i now appreciate it more as i do with a few other disney classics that i have watched recently including sleeping beauty and pinnochio or however you spell it i now very much appreciate the animation the clever disney plot turns the humour from the mice the emotions expressed and the plot the animation is very well done often it seems you are wherever the other characters are watching them the animation also does well portraying the styles of the backgrounds including the town which is shown twice briefly disney changes this from the original fairy tale in a surprisingly good way injecting clever plot turns such as the mice making the clothes and the key part usually i do not like disney films very much if they are not that similar to the original story but with this i am not overly bothered i feel they made necessary changes to make this a good disney film often i do not think disney changed the book in a good way in some of their films you know the story already cinderella is a girl working for her horrible stepmother and stepsisters she goes to a ball with the help of her fairy godmother and loses a glass slipper this is a film very much to be watched with other people immediate family is not good enough to enjoy this i recommend you watch it with friends and immediate family if you like i recommend this to people who like disney at least a little bit people who like fairy tales and for people who like mice enjoy
this movie is cold bare truth often we think oh no that won t happen to me but it can drug smuggling is big money and often people are unknowingly or tricked into doing things for smugglers the story of these two girls is the story of many young people who like them only wanted a exotic holiday which turned into a nightmare people need to know that these sort of events aren t improbable or exaggerated this is a major problem in today s society i would recommend this movie to mature viewers because of the understanding needed to truly appreciate this movie it is very emotional and raw well worth watching and certainly stays in your memory
when john singleton is on he s on and this is one of his better films not quite as tight as boyz n the hood but close to it and with much of the same stellar cast this film was very well written very well put together and very well shot there s very little to criticize and most of my complaints are superficial eg where did fudge get the money for years of college and a lot of expensive stuff no mention of a rich background and why doesn t professor phibbs have an office a professor of his stature should have one and while we re at it for an engineering student hick or not remy s a pretty dumb character i d think that he d have a bit more in the way of basic intelligence he talks and acts like a total buffoon but that aside the film was very sharp a good array of characters and points of view and singleton doesn t take sides in the story many of the characters are unsympathetic and he does a good job of interspersing the panthers and supremacist scenes together to show the folly on both sides much of the cinematography was excellent i especially loved the scene where kirsty swanson gets intimate with taryn and wayne each scene spliced together really well also the malik deja scenes were really well shot as well the dialogue was a bit much at times this film had a tendency to get really preachy at times and it also tends to hammer the points it was making over your head when the points would be just as clear with out the bluntness we really didn t need the us flag with unlearn typed onto it give some credit we re not morons and to top it off although most of the time singleton uses melodrama quite well sometimes it gets way too cheezy like deja s death which is fine until she screams out why which simply ruined the entire effect and scene but the acting in general was top of the line fabulous performances by omar epps perhaps the best i ve ever seen kirsty swanson who knew buffy could act michael rapaport surprised the hell out of me after true romance and beautiful girls i though he was a one role actor and of course ice cube and laurence fishburne are always outstanding downside jennifer connelly was flat though it s not completely her fault her role was stereotypical and one dimensional generic to the highest degree and tyra banks who had the role was nothing short of horrid she whined and whined and whined yet another in the long line of models turned actresses who failed miserably though there are a few who prove the exception to this rule finally the soundtrack wow an amazing soundtrack which is definitely worth buying which fits the film like a glove each scene has a twin song although the tori amos songs started to really annoy me by the end not her best work liz phair rage against the machine ice cube how can one go wrong all in all a really good watch a really strong cast great script great film
i m biased towards any movie that paints a luxuriant picture of italy in my opinion the most romantic country in the world unfortunately the movie was rather short unusually so for a period piece and a little sparse on the cinematography aspect however the excellent story makes up for it the four ladies embark on a much needed relaxing vacation with problems on their minds over the course of the movie they realize their problems and begin fixing them they believe san salvatore the castle they stay in has an enchanting effect on people it s a tub of love says lottie wilkins you can watch their gradual change from dissatisfied to exuberant as the italian seaside works its magic on them all their problems and their solutions are plausible the actresses were great the background music seemed very appropriate for an romantic italian locale all in all a movie for me
more tv movies ought to be made like this one i saw it way back in when it was first on tv helen hunt and steven weber were both terrific giving very gritty and realistic performances weber was especially good turning in an exceptionally creepy and understated performance as the child molester killer this film really increased my respect for hunt as an actress the director also directed hoosiers which was somehow both formulaic and exciting but the direction in both of these works has the same stark simple realism that is so appealing if you like tv movies that aren t predictable and filled with overacting see it if you can the side story about hunt and fahey s affair is also appealing without detracting from the main story
this series got me into deighton s writing and the genre when i was younger and i love this presentation of the story i would however disagree with the above comment from what i have read in the past it is not holm s performance that lead deighton to refuse to have the series released but the butchering that all three books received in the translation to the screen a great example of this is the rewrite of the boarder crossing that ended samson s field career the scene is not in the book the character who dies in the minefield was never in any of the books and the crossing in sinker was from east germany to west germany not the polish frontier this whole storyline is cloth the changes in set similarly damage the integrity of the story my perspective on holm s performance was that he portrayed the disorientation of samson during his wife s defection excellently and i believe comported himself well in portraying the aging field agent desperately trying to bridge the class divide samson both pays for his father s idealism and suffers due to its influence on his life as clevemore comments had he gotten himself an education he would have probably been running the department i think the true loss of performance is due to physical appearance more than anything holm is diminutive when compared to the samson of the book a physically impressive man capable of using his size to impose a presence
if i wanted to dribble i d call a nurse haven t you had enough more than enough you got me a choo choo if i begin to die please remove the cowboy hat from my head that is not the way i wish to be remembered some of the wonderfully humorous and often insightful quotations from this charming and often insightful film dudley moore is charming lovable and rich sir john gielgud is aristocratic charming and loving and poor the two have a non father father and son relationship which defines the man whom arthur is to become will he follow his heart and soul or just his wealth over twenty five years i ve returned to this movie with glee and amusement and joy it is a movie to return to time and time again and remember what is important in life as short as it is judge miller
this is a visual adaptation of manga with very little dialogue what dialogue there is appears in word baloons as it would in the manga the plot of this is existent but only vaguely accounted for there is an issue of the manga on which this is based available in english in the blast books collection comics underground japan and it has actual captioned dialogue that explains the plot a bit more than here i recommend checking that volume out if you liked this as it explains some of the plot of the movie which is otherwise inexplicable animation wise this is pretty decent good unintrusive use of computers and the images are for the most part realized well it jumps in and out of episodes as the characters a cat and his brain dead older sister cat wander in and out of a series of odd images a boat a circus a desert for a mere half hour they go through a number of semi plots and settings which leads me to believe that the director chose a number of issues of the long running manga to adapt at random but primarilly selected visually knowing what s going on might somewhat increase appreciation this reminds me mostly of the kind of stuff they used to play on the mtv show cartoon sushi in particular a short that features a cat chasing a man s severed butt cheek around the house only in this case the cats resemble hello kitty more and their adventure is expanded to include death and reincarnation and a number of other themes though not all that easy to tell what s going on the dvd of this has director s commentary and a making of features but i cant comment on those because i didnt get around to them i m giving this a for now here isnt much to compare it to in anime and i hope for more like this
nice pleasant and funny but not earth shattering it does a good job of showing the behind the scenes world of theater groups and the lives of the actors the three witches are great both on and off stage i would assume the movie works wonderfully lots of apparent inside jokes if one was involved in theater which i m not
actually i m surprised there were so many comments about this movie i saw it as part of a slavic film festival at a major american university but nobody in usa has heard of it which is a real shame the dynamics between the people are what makes it both funny and sad they are stuck together on a long bus trip someplace most of us have been but i never had one like this my favorite scene is the one where they stop for the funeral then the man woman sneak off for some lovemaking in the forest but everybody follows them to watch without them knowing just as she raises her skirt and he enters her all the way the consumptive starts hacking they realize everybody is watching talk about surprised but you really have to feel for them even if it is hilariously funny when you see the ending it is sort of ironic that they enjoyed themselves while they did serb humor at it s best
i saw this movie in the theater when it came out i grew up in scottsdale and i went to arizona state and really enjoyed seeing locations where i spent so much time i remember at the time thinking that barbara s venture into more of a rock sound actually r and b to my ears was a successful one i was never a fan of kris s singing until his last effort for new west as a songwriter and an actor though he has serious chops imho i think it is a fine romance i like it better than the judy garland version and never saw selznick s janet gaynor original i do believe that they made some changes in this long awaited dvd release among other things i recall the helicopter shot which reveals a packed sun devil stadium being longer and more dramatic i wish they had done a better job writing music for kris or god forbid put some of his original songs in there along those lines i have some information from a primary source that says that the music was a problem for kris and barbara while doing interviews for my own new music documentary rocking the boat a musical conversation and journey i interviewed stephen bruton a fine singer songwriter guitarist with close professional and personal ties to kris bonnie raitt and delbert mcclinton among many others stephen was in speedway the john norman character s band kris was having a real hard time turning what was essentially a pop score into something that could pass for rock stephen was and is kris s friend and long time band member there was tension on the set and at one point the band was barking at kris in barbara s presence she remarked to the effect that the band shouldn t talk to him like that kris came right back to the effect that they were his friends and they were rock and roll in the end barbara came around and decided to use kris s band s live performances in the movie and specifically sited stephen s role in making things work i gained even greater respect for her as an artist upon hearing this story much is made of her as a diva what she is is a pro and i am not gay not that there is anything wrong with that
there is so much to love in this darling little comedy anyone who has ever built or bought a house or even just been short of space will find that there is more than just a grain of truth in the plight of the addled mr blanding melvyn douglas with great comedic flare both narrates and acts as the blandings attorney and voice of reason as well myrna loy is at her best as a rather scatterbrained but extremely patient wife but the best performance is grant s he is the american everyman especially relevant at the time of this film s release when the nation was in the grips of a housing shortage after the end of the war the themes are universal lack of money work strain fear of infidelity yes it does wrap up awfully neatly but you must keep in mind that this was a time when the world was just recovering from a terrible war and wanted a happy ending it is still relevant today and i must chalk up the poor reviews i see to a present preference for dumbed down gross out comedies the look of the film is slick and there are some great bits of comedy is well particularly toward the beginning while it may have lost some of it s social relevance nearly sixty years after it s release it is still a gem
strangely erotic schlock gothic horror that will be loved by hammer house of horror fans the world over appears to be an interesting take on beauty and the beast it is definitely worth a look and surprisingly well acted when taking into consideration the genre and era corsets castles rutting horses rampaging faux fur monsters in the woods proof that no one had a brazilian in the s and more bodily fluids than you can shake a stick at what more could you possibly want it certainly brightened my sunday afternoon
me and my girlfriend annette watched this together and we ll both comment both of us really enjoyed watching this even though it took some liberties with dicken s work a lot of dicken s works are somewhat dark and dreary including oliver twist but this movie changed all that it was fun colourful both visually and musically and the characters were more lighthearted travis normally i don t care a lot for musical and dance movies but the tunes in this production were catchy and lively and the choreography was awesome annette that s really saying a lot coming from travis i can t emphasise enough how really good the dance numbers were you can tell for example that those boys really worked hard getting the routines down to perfection travis three actors really stood out imo nancy shani w bill sykes oliver reed and artful dodger jack wild man that oliver reed can really do a good villain that one scene where you see his eyes thru the mail slot gave me chills down the back awesome and that kid jack wild was a perfect artful dodger and nancy was fantastic man i felt bad when she got killed she can sing too kudos to the casting department on their choices there i hated the oliver twist kid tho he was just too whiny and wimpy for my taste i kept wishing bill sikes would drop him off into the mud during the chase scene and they shouldn t have had him sing either annette acting was truly superb in addition to the three stars travis mentioned i felt ron moody fagin did a tremendous job he was so funny and at the same time lightly sinister too the supporting actors were great too harry secombe carried his mr bumble role extremely well and he has a wonderful singing voice i saw mr secombe perform in another movie entitled davy where he played an opera singer with pleasing results the talented harry secombe should have been in a lot more movies travis as i mentioned earlier the story isn t quite true to the book but imo it was more robust this movie was not boring either as some musicals seem to be and the continuity kept you moving right along with the characters the tunes did not detract from the plot or put you to sleep by being too long annette any musical movie which travis watches completely has to be a rare find and this one is indeed a rare find it is a very easy to watch production which carries the viewer smoothly and enjoyably through to the end in a day when movies all seem to be effects combined with pretty faces this was a refreshing interlude our combined rating for this was of we ll round up to in this case travis i rated this a mainly because the oliver twist kid mark l irritated me and his songs were torture to my overly sensitive ears otherwise it was an outstanding movie annette my rating is a movies don t get much better than this and you can tell everyone involved in this production really worked hard to make it what it was a masterpiece please don t miss this one even if you normally don t like musicals it really is a rare treat
when paris is burning came out i totally dismissed it i was not into the whole madonna and vogueing phenomenon i thought it was going to be campy and silly how wrong i was about this movie i watched it after the movie had been out for ten years and i ran out and bought it it took me back to a time and place of fun and excitement i felt as though i knew all of the characters personally the s were spectacular and the movie captured the essence of the gay culture what a terrific job i went on the internet and found out what some of the original casts members were doing now but i have not been able to locate all of them if any one has any information on any of the casts members please let me know i hope they make another documentary i loved it
if you like cb you have no idea what you re missing if you haven t seen this film yet this movie is crazy hilarious and incorporates a lot more about the hip hop industry than any other parody movie it is unfortunate that this movie has not been released on dvd because it is one movie that everybody i ve ever watched it with has loved and wanted a copy if you really want a good laugh and you like hip hop and are a little familiar with some old school performers definitley rent this movie there aren t that many video rental places that have copies of it but if you happen to come across one you will not be disappointed
father is still away on business was headline of an review after promise me this premiere in cannes i do understand why many thinks the same but unique expression of kusturica is still present in his new movie and is something why critics can t touch him i had two hours of pure energy without rest even when kusturica is suffering of lack of concentration or fear of empty space he is still unique and unspoiled surprisingly good performance of stribor kusturica much more close ups and less landscapes then in life is a miracle marija petronijevic has femme fatal world class potential please don t spoil it surely i recommend to everyone to see this film
i used to watch this show when i was a little girl when i think about it i only remember it vaguely if you ask me it was a good show two things i remember vaguely are the opening sequence and theme song in addition to that everyone was ideally cast also the writing was very strong the performances were top grade too i hope some network brings it back so i can see every episode before i wrap this up i d like to say that i ll always remember this show in my memory forever even though i don t think i ve seen every episode now in conclusion if some network ever brings it back i hope that you catch it one day before it goes off the air for good
well it s been a long year and i m down to reviewing the final film for panaghoy sa suba call of the river placed second in the recent metro manila film festival as expected it didn t do so well at the box office as it was too artsy for the common moviegoers especially since mmff is the season where a lot of families go out to see movies it was quite intriguing to see a movie that was not in filipino or english play out in the screen i thought cesar montano did a good job both as a star and director his great vision and creativity really helped this film he was also very effective as the lead star and was able to express a wide range of emotions that was required for the film also performing well was young actress rebecca lusterio she did a great job portraying bikay the younger sister of duroy i hope to see her in many more film projects in the future perhaps venturing into other genres i think that the fact that this film was in her local dialect really helped her some of the camera shots in the film were done very well the scenery was made breathtaking even though i feel that if a lesser effort would have looked completely different in terms of the story i feel that the writers could have delved further into the lives of the lesser characters in the film i certainly won t be raving about the story of this film
that s what one of the girls said at the end is the soccer game a metaphor for a qualifying game between the girls or more broadly a free thinking group and the authority to germany means to a future that s of hope it s one of the most unforgettable cinematic experience i ve ever had despite the crude cinematography and plot and mild over acting though i like the cast they re lovable and well above the expectation for amateurs the ridiculous situation is well captured i can feel the deep frustration being denied to a game being female and a soccer fan and i cannot stop thinking how to make a convincing disguise i wonder why there s no women s section in which protection from dirty language and bad behavior can be provided defeating the flawed reasons for the deny the movie is very cleverly made the amazing title the filming during the actual game the spontaneity and various methods to put the viewers into the shoes of the characters the game that s so important but inaccessible not shown the luring light and cheering sound from the stadium the confinement of the van and the uselessness of it when those inside connect with the celebrating crowds outside i can feel the comfort coming from the radio the drinks and the food and of course the kindness and consideration from each character to others during the end credits i am amused that no character has a name he s just any soldier and she s just any girl or sister
this place in england during three orphans carrie charles and paul are sent to live with miss price angela lansbury she doesn t want them but reluctantly takes them in it seems she is studying to be a witch through a correspondence course with the college of witchcraft ok i realize this is a family film but college of witchcraft come on before she can finish the course though the college is closed because of the war and she seeks down the head professor browne david tomlinson and her and the kids travel around on a bed with the help of a magical bedknob i first saw this when i was and vaguely remember loving it it sure doesn t hold up as an adult the story is silly even for a fantasy the kids are terrible actors and one of them charles is incredibly obnoxious also roddy mcdowall is third billed and only appears in two short scenes there s also a trip to the isle of naboombu which is run by animated animals i thought that might be fun but the animation is poor for disney and it has a very violent and far too long soccer game between the animals there are a few saving graces here lansbury and tomlinson are just great the songs while forgettable are pleasant the long dance sequence on portobello road is very colorful and full of energy and the oscar winning special effects are still pretty impressive at the end but the weak story line poor animation and unlikable kids really pull this one down i heard the extended version is even worse i can only give this a
though i liked on the town better i really liked it i m a new comer when it comes to frank sinatra and gene kelly though i had heard of them i had never seen anything with them in it until recently the first one i saw was singin in the rain that made me a fan of gene s i think that is better too but i thought that this movie was good and like all movies there are some parts that are better than others but in my book it s an awesome movie and i love it frank and gene make a good team i have yet to see them together in take me out to the ballgame but i m sticking to my guns bu saying that i really enjoyed it and that i love it
when i saw the movie at first i thought that it was boring because nothing was happening but when all the scary things started to happen like when church dies and is brought back to life and also gage and his mom die and there idiot dad has to bring them back to life even though he nows the warnings and ignores jud this is not steven kings best work i thought that his best work was the shining i don t think that people who see this movie and comment on how awful it was are wrong because all they think is that what were they thinking as if that person can do a better job in making a horror flick i mean making the gage evil and how he kills jud is genius making the most innocent most unsuspecting character into one of the killers is cool people who didn t like the movie are dumb because all it is a scary movie and nothing all don t expect something from a movie that it isn t it still in a general area wasn t that good i still recommend people to watch the movie
how truly friendly charming and cordial is this unpretentious old serial i rejoiced in seeing old lugosi it is disarmingly friendly and lively it s the document of a long lost craft the best tv series today can hardly compete with these old moderately good serials chandu is deeply deeply optimistic and hedonistic it refreshes the mind it s not stupid stupid are those who do not get the terms on which such serials work chandu has an irresistible sense of simple unpretentious and friendly fun without giving away too much chandu is an occidental sorcerer who goes also by this eastern name and who also loves and protects his niece against a sect of killers chandu exerts his supernatural gifts in a rather discreet and moderate way as to the quite sexy niece nadji she is kidnapped by the priest of ubasti the sordid vindhyan the poor sexy girl is in fact multiply kidnapped in a sarcophagus after being sent asleep with a flower almost kidnapped from a boat by a phony policeman the temple of lemuria and its strange creepy ceremonies resemble the king kong imagery and are a barbaric mockery of the rcc ceremonies and rituals would you protect a girl as bravely as chandu does lugosi looked like an old libidinous and quite heartless mean drunk and this only contributed to his performances he is the prototypical mean drunk uncle mischievous and cunning and oblique this might sound like a rather crooked homage to lugosi yet burton s biopic of wood left me this impression about lugosi and allied to it a strong sympathy for the decrepit actor i enjoy lugosi fancy performances this serial is unjustly bashed
famous for introducing the world to hedy lamarr and full frontal nudity but it s oh so much more in fact this is one of the pinnacles of cinematic poetry up there with some of the seminal works of s art cinema in the same prestigious group as under the roofs of paris tabu olympia and even l atalante it s nearly a silent relying mostly on its miraculous images and also its fantastic symphonic score by giuseppe becce it s a masterpiece of cinematography and music yes and also of editing direction writing and acting a good of the film moves along perfectly machat seems an expert at using motifs perhaps not as subtle as it could be and perhaps a bit overused but the appearances of objects like insects lights and horses carry the story forward beautifully the small snatches of dialogue are thankfully unintrusive they don t jar as much as one would imagine the final bit is odd to say the least reminiscent of russian silents we have a montage of workers this barely makes sense in the course of the narrative but it s so gorgeously done that i refuse to harp too much on that flaw ecstasy is a film that is desperately in need of rediscovery it belongs amongst the best films ever made
i like this episode quite a bit ruth gordon is good if not a little hammy as she always was as has been stated the music is very good and it has a moodiness that doesn t exist in all episodes but one major plot hole exists so wide you can drive a fleet of trucks through it it is established that the light doesn t work in the vault don t you think that the very intelligent columbo or the rest of the police would have thought to check if the light bulb worked you d think in pretty short order they would have unscrewed the bulb and so found the note granted this is tv whodunit fiction and various holes will always be found but this seems much too glaring it really doesn t make columbo out to be the hidden genius when the light doesn t work but the death bed testimony goes on unfound apparently for days
take couples whose relationships were already on the rocks and put them on an island paradise where they ll be tempted by singles this was the premise of the show simple yet outrageous funny leave it to fox to throw morality out the window let the debauchery flow it was like a real life version of melrose place the good thing about the show is that it wasn t about people conniving manipulating each other for a cash prize it was about lust temptation pure and simple the ultimate test for a relationship people either loved the show or hated it it was kind of like slowing down to look at a horrific traffic accident you know you shouldn t watch but you can t help but look drama aside there was a lot of eye candy
i just love malle s documentaries they are so effortless and simple but still so fascinating i have no idea why this documentary works it is about glencoe minnesota people live there and nothing happens really but still malle manages to make it fascinating and interesting his love for humanity even racist or homophobic people is so overwhelming that you just can t help but also to fall in love with them too malle filmed most of it in he came back years later to see what had changed this would have been a good film without the material years later but this small addition makes it great it may sound like malle was just doing what has been done in the up series but in fact it is not the up series are about people malle s emphasis is not so much on what happened to each person but what has happened to this community and the change is great is the reagan era and the farmers are suffering once a proud community now no one sees much future at all and parents hope their children will educate them self and do something else than farming this documentary is quite relevant today our financial crises today started because of what was happening then just take a look to these final words in the film spoken by an older lawyer from the town in well i have high hopes for this country because the things that are going on right now can only be characterized in my mind as an obsession with greed and a nation doesn t live long with that obsession and particularly a democracy that there s good there s good a lot of good in this country and a lot of good people and they aren t gonna they aren t gonna subscribe to this philosophy of greed that s going on now it s horrible unfortunately it took more than years and a hell of a headache before that happened
although this lovely work of art does use some of the cinematic vocabulary of surrealism it is in fact nothing of the sort it is a political and cultural allegory of mexico s post columbian odyssey as even a passing glance at mexico s history will attest in contrast to like water for chocolate erendira expects the viewer to meet it at least half way so that understanding it takes a little work a good starting point is to see the grandmother character as spain proud aloof sorrowful and above all else weighed down with history the ultimate actions of the heroine are obscure because the outcome of history i e the present is always obscure since we are too close to it for honest evaluation refusal to neatly tie up loose ends is the only real choice available to the director given the ambitions of the film erendira is gorgeous a big screen experience would be ideal if you can catch it at a local art house or university screening but if not vhs is better than never seeing it at all
reading a wide variety of scoop reviews over the past few days i walked into the theater prepared for a subpar outing from woody happily i couldn t have been more wrong granted woody the performer is slowing down a touch or two but woody the writer director is in fine form and found a credible way to integrate his year old self into the story judging from the laughter and guffaws the audience ate up allen s one liners and dialogue in a way that i haven t seen in several years in a movie landscape dominated by software approved story arcs twentysomething tastes and assembly line formula fare for kiddies it s a source of both satisfaction and inspiration to see allen pursuing his highly personal and still rewarding path
a light hearted comedy nothing shows us a world that we sometimes wish to escape to a world of nothing anything you don t like be it a stack of bills a bad memory or even hunger can disappear at your wish they approached this movie very well and with an enjoyable starring duo there were only a few things i didn t like about nothing and they weren t even part of the main movie first the post credits scene and yes there is one good for a chuckle but what were they trying to accomplish with that i was confused and eager to see a return to something after a whole movie of nothing instead we just hear a random assortment of noises and they scream it tries to set up a sequel in my opinion and wasn t really necessary nor was it funny after the turtle crawled out of frame second the trailer i saw the trailer on the dvd and like others have already said this it promotes a horror movie that never came oh well poor marketing i guess if you see this at your movie rental store take a look because nothing is a great movie to watch if you have a big screen though you might want to wear shades
christina raines plays a lovely model in new york who seeks out a new apartment and begins to meet strange neighbors and reveal a secret about the building and herself slowly building up to quite a climax by film s end this film has all kinds of neat plot elements from the roman catholic church vs the devil to the gateway to hell to bizarre rituals to a growing conspiracy and finally to a host of talented famous actors and actresses flooding the film we get ava gardner burgess meredith chris sarandon jerry orbach deborah raffin arthur kennedy jose ferrer slyvia miles beverly deangelo eli wallach martin balsam christopher walkin william hickey tom berenger jeff goldblum and who can forget john carradine as the old priest many of these actors ham it up particularly burgess meredith giving a fine comic demented performance as one of the neighbors with a little bird and a cat meredith is memorable as is balsam and chris sarandon some of the performers have virtually nothing to do like jose ferrer in a thankless role even if it is nothing more than a cameo the sentinel is a fine horror film with plenty of psychological elements and some truly terrifying scenes the end scene is repulsive and yet chilling i do find fault with some of the gratuitous sex and violence in the film particularly that whole scene with deangelo and miles was that really necessary i think not also the father daughter stuff was a bit much as well but overall the film works and has a winning pace director michael winner does a workmanlike job and is effective creating tension and scary movie moments the scenes with carradine are particularly effective
had this been the original version of tess of the storm country also starring mary pickford i probably would have rated it a lot higher as this sort of extreme melodrama and sentimentality was pretty typical of the teens however by this film was already starting to show its age and compared to many of ms pickford s other films such as daddy longlegs sparrows my best girl and suds tess comes up a tad short and not every pickford film merits a even if she was america s sweetheart now this isn t to say that it s a bad film it certainly isn t but i just can t see how so many have given this film a the film has a very long and complicated plot especially because most films of the era were shorter a rich old crank builds a mansion at the top of a hill next to the river at the bottom of the hill are some dirty squatters who he hates but who he cannot evict so he tries to come up with a variety of ways to get them off the land one ends up in tragedy when his daughter s fianc is killed in a scuffle with the po folks the man accused of the murder is dear old mary s father though he is innocent to make things a lot worse the only witness to the real murder won t talk and the dead man had gotten his fianc e pregnant so at this point we have an innocent man in prison waiting to be executed and a pregnant lady afraid to tell her sanctimonious father she is in the family way there s a ton more to the film such as the crank s son falling in love with mary but it s best you just see the film for yourself the film excels in some ways the plot while very complicated is also rather interesting and the cinematography is top notch the very final scene is also pretty cute however there is so much overt sentimentality you can practically cut it with a knife mary is so good and so sweet and so plucky at times the viewer might find it all a bit hard to take while it worked great in making her the biggest star in the world today it s very dated this is not true of all her films but this one certainly is by the way the image entertainment dvd is of decent quality though a few scenes are badly degraded something that isn t very surprising considering the age of the film also the only extras included are a brief filmography
how can t you rate this movie with i admit to say that this movie is not very entertaining but the goal is not to tell you a story but history this is the first real movie of cinema history le prince de galles was first but it was not technically perfect enough and it has an undoubtedly huge international value these people that you can see finishing their working day in the movie had the chance to participate to a historic moment becoming the first persons to be able to see themselves moving and above all the shot is a beautiful shot and it s very moving when you think about the first persons to have seen that what a moment historic for science first because the lumiere brothers first invented the cinematographe for scientific reasons and for art later a movie to venerate
this was soul provoking i am an iranian and living in th st century i didn t know that such big tribes have been living in such conditions at the time of my grandfather you see that today or even in on one side of the world a lady or a baby could have everything served for him or her clean and on demand but here years ago people ventured their life to go to somewhere with more grass it s really interesting that these persians bear those difficulties to find pasture for their sheep but they lose many the sheep on their way i praise the americans who accompanied this tribe they were as tough as bakhtiari people
above average film and acting partly spoiled by its completely predictable story line even the music is chosen so that the words fit the action every time a scent of pleasantville camp hangs around this flick as a period piece it s more accurate than not its depiction of the tragedy of company towns and lack of upward mobility is sketchy but moving chris cooper turns in a first class performance as howard s coal miner daddy
the most moving and truly eye opening documentary ever created i cried the whole way through from start to end watching the show you are immediately captured by a man s struggle to live without pain to live a life we would take for granted the first time i heard the title i was almost scared to see the program it was hard for me to comprehend living in agony every day of every year of my life i truly felt for him the saddest part of the documentary is when jonny picks out his coffin could you imagine doing that even more so even though he was in excruciating and unbearable pain he still opened up his own charity debra jonny is one of the only people that deserves true respect and admiration he is the definition of a role model what a true and undeniable hero he was
this shorter movie is the epitome the expected results when the imbecile runs the asylum it is sad how the futures of these young people were rolled down a craps table when neither saddam hussein nor the people of iraq god rest the souls of the plus that have been killed had anything to do with terrorism nor al quida following this movie the astute viewer will need to pick up or download a copy of loose change this movie is available free on the internet until the bush cabal locks it down by googling up the very title as indicated in parenthesis god save our country this will not be done by following the christo fascists that controlled the halls of congress for over years prior to november
first of all no adaptation is ever as good as the book especially when you re dealing with master writer like tolkien this adaptation wonderfully synthesizes tolkien s universe with s psychedelia aesthetics and liberal culture yes the animation and background painting is sometimes a little rough in its technical execution but it s beautiful none the less and very evocative in terms of giving a unique sense of place to each of the scenes beyond the absolute uniqueness in imagery is the absolutely outstanding voice acting acting that s far superior to the acting in the new live action movies and while the cell animation might not be the most technically proficient animation it superbly captures the expressive bodily and facial gestures of the acting while at once not forgetting to be subtle and nuanced the background paintings vary from traditional fantasy motif to outright abstraction but the transition to abstracted settings is always motivated by the narrative and contributes greatly to the themes of the film if you re a person who has to have extensive computer rendering in a film so that everything is visualized for you then i can see how you might not like this movie but if you enjoy superior acting transcendental imagery and jrr tolkien then this film is a must see
this is a very rare example of a movie about transvestitism of heterosexuals the film treats the taboo theme so that even a general audience not knowing of transvestitism at all will strongly sympathize with its main character adrian pasdar is very believable as gerald geraldine and shall not be forgot for this brillant acting the directing of christopher monger is very sensitively treating such a difficult issue quite excellently packed into a good story not a big movie neither an art film but a little lovely motion picture
i must admit when i read the description of the genre on netflix as steamy romance i was a little bit skeptical steamy in a movie from i was prepared for disappointment and when i realized it was shot entirely in black white i knew my erotic hopes were dashed boy was i wrong not only does this film have all of the elements of a steamy romance the discovery of first love fear of the secret being found out a sudden unexpected end but at times this movie was downright erotic you will soon forget that it is shot in black white the cinematography deserves every accolade it has received over the years and the performances from the two stars essy persson and anna gael are intense and memorable ok so they re both in their mid twenties trying to play school girls it s do you really expect teenagers from the s to be able to effectively explore a lesbian love story like this many adult women were still trying to come to grips with their sexuality back then anyone looking for real teens here is expecting too much i think this movie was way ahead of its time the level of eroticism was an unexpected pleasure yet it still managed to leave a lot to the imagination opting instead to give us poetic descriptions to add to what we were shown i have no doubt lesbians will identify with the characters here as for you straight guys who love watching lesbians in action although it won t be all you expect i don t think you ll be too too disappointed
i have just finished watching this film and i can honestly say that this is a work of art i was very surprised to see the overall rating as not only does guy bring together a b list ish movie cast and make them into such glorious characters he has given us a movie with a fantastically diverse story line with much left to the imagination far too many people are wanting movies with a plot that can be understood and handed to them on a plate yet these are the films that get poor reviews because they are far too predictable this film is special get it now
melvyn douglas once more gives a polished performance in which this time he inhabits the role of a detective who can t place love before duty and adventure and the warmly beautiful joan blondell who far from being illiterate as one reviewer suggested wrote a novel about her early life is as enjoyable as ever as his ever suffering sweetheart it s almost a screwball comedy almost a thin man type movie almost a series i guess that didn t quite make it to a sequel it doesn t quite reach classic status but it has all the ingredients for a fun minutes with an episodic but pacey script fine character actors and direction that keeps it all moving fast enough so that you nearly don t notice that williams douglas isn t exactly columbo when it comes to detecting i wish there were more films like this
burlinson and thornton give an outstanding performance in this movie along with dennehy although it is at first thought to be only about love it really goes down deeper than that the beauty of nature captures this movie placing among one of the best i have ever seen the horse scenes are absolutely fantastic any horse lovers out there will love this movie
icy and lethal ace hit man tony arzenta a divinely smooth and commanding performance by alain delon wants to quit the assassination business but the dangerous mobsters he works for won t let him after his wife and child are killed arzenta declares open season on everyone responsible for their deaths director duccio tessari relates the absorbing story at a constant snappy pace maintains a properly serious and no nonsense tone throughout stages the stirring shoot outs and exciting car chases with considerable rip snorting brio and punctuates the narrative with jolting outbursts of explosive bloody violence delon s suave and charismatic presence adds extra class to the already engrossing proceedings this film further benefits from sterling acting by a bang up cast with praiseworthy contributions by richard conte as wise mafia kingpin nick gusto carla gravini as arzenta s supportive lady friend sandra marc porel as arzenta s loyal pal domenico maggio anton diffring as ruthless calculating capo grunwald and lino troisi as the venomous gangster rocco cutitta silvano ippoliti s glossy cinematography boasts several graceful pans gianni ferrio s funky score hits the get down groovy spot erika blanc and rosalba neri pop up briefly in nifty bit parts better still there s no filler to speak of and we even get a decent dab of tasty gratuitous female nudity the startling conclusion packs a mean and lingering wallop right to the gut a solid and satisfying winner
i loved the story somewhere a poster said there are no families like the one portrayed in this film well maybe there ought to be i thought everybody seemed really human and believable what a top notch cast what great music on the soundtrack what a nice this and what a nice that but most of all i will say two words to recommend this film steve carell he really showed a nice subtle depth that touched me he was truly commanding as a widower who had dedicated himself maybe a little too much to being a good dad first at the cost of denying his own needs did he act like a petulant ass why yes he did and you see that s what was perfect about this film the actor who played this character made me believe he was feeling something and not simply acting like he was feeling something and he conveyed to me perfectly what it was that he was feeling and what he was feeling was denied denied happiness denied fulfillment denied love losing your love is painful beyond belief and many who do so will never feel something like that again beautiful film i gave it an eight out of ten
this is the second part of the animatrix a collection of animated short movies that tell us a little more about the world of the matrix in this one we learn how men and machines could not work and live together it is a little history lesson in the world of the matrix not as good as the first part the final flight of the osiris but still pretty entertaining
but the fun is in the journey i found this movie to be extremely enjoyable not only are both leads extremely easy on the eyes the humor from the supporting cast and the jokes actually made me laugh out loud several times yes it s predictable and yes it s a clich romantic comedy but the point is that it s a sweet story the message about finding your one true love also rings true in many ways the dialog is dead on and the acting is well done on all parts and over the top for comic effect the bulgari scene is worth it s weight in gold the actress there deserves honorable mention for those that panned it for being predictable if you want a film with twists and turns that keep you guessing then you want a thriller this is a romantic comedy it touched my heart and made me realize that i was lucky enough to find my true love in life and it has been worth every effort along the way great date movie great movie for a happy cry
here is one movie that is genuinely funny at every single moment that it covers how can it not be given that this movie stars the creators of south park and is directed by david zucker when i first saw this movie i did nt immediately realise that coop and doug were really matt and trey but their talent in acting and writing came out as quite impressive i was pleasantly surprised to learn that they were really matt and trey later on the humor is sometimes crude sometimes foul sometimes brilliant sometimes subtle sometimes loud and sometimes stupid but overall this is one hell of a movie that is without doubt under rated well actually its insane totally insane
i wouldn t go so far as to not recommend this movie since the only problems i have with it are due to an overexposure to the plot devices used in the movie the sort of things common to every kids movie ever made it seems that doesn t make it bad just not something i d go far it is a little saccharine so i might say that for the most part anyone looking for something with a little more wit could be disappointed in an obviously for kids movie like this however all of that goes out the window when that squirrel the one in all the trailers comes on screen his time is limited but it seems apparent that the decision makers had the wisdom to tell these guys hey could you stick in a little more squirrel every time it s getting intolerably dull that doesn t save the movie but you can leave saying at least there was one aspect where i couldn t stop laughing and of course visually it won t disappoint but that s almost a given with pixar flicks of all of their stuff i d put this at the bottom but that isn t in itself bad
every second of the film is gorgeous and that s why it earns a because the plot is not especially devious and thinking back over the last minutes i never really felt any excitement or investment in the characters if anything the luxurious graphics and framing have made certain scenes the car chase for instance more pedestrian than they ought to be not that they don t look lovely and have some very original design and occasionally novel camera angles but they are missing the kinetic movement and close up shots that are part of the language for any normal action thriller the first hour plods along and the dialogue feels very edited and a bit stagey people wait for each other to finish and don t always react in a natural cadence which would be a problem of recording each individual s dialogue separately on rare occasions the emotions in the voices don t quite match those on screen something that should really have been avoided the futuristic architecture is very attractive lots of glass walls ceilings screens lovely smoke mirage special effects and nice looking cars but again it s more an exercise in graphic design having no real impact on the story i d argue that the whole point of using drawn animation instead of actors cgi is to really push the limits of imagination and design to do that which is too difficult impractical in other mediums although the animation in renaissance is certainly stunning and incredibly well accomplished i never felt like i was seeing something that hasn t been done before immortel another french cgi film also suffers from an imbalance of beauty over story pace to be fair some marvellous and engaging french movies also have a languid pace and lingering shots of the look in someone s eyes or the rain on paris cobbles can evoke great emotion but animators need to understand that while animation brings unique strengths it also has weaknesses when compared to real life technique perhaps it would break from the noir rules that the film wants to stick to but i think the film makers also missed a glaring opportunity to explore their future society a bit more the social strata the fascistic grip of the corporations etc i have no problem recommending renaissance to anybody who enjoys stylistic design and or animation manga fans in particular but i wouldn t make my other film loving friends sit through it take away the sumptuous visuals and it s a barely average film
this modern film noir with its off beat humour and dizzying succession of plot twists delivers a story full of surprises dangerous characters and excellent entertainment from start to finish it s impossible not to empathise with the honest unassuming hero or to be gripped by the ways in which he tries to navigate his way out of the terrible predicaments that he finds himself in so all you can do is fasten your seat belt and enjoy the ride the story of an ordinary guy who makes a poor decision and then finds that the repercussions propel him into an uncontrollable sequence of events from which he is unable to extricate himself is pure film noir the same is true of the themes of murder deceit corruption and duplicity which are pervasive throughout many of the familiar noir visual motifs are also present such as the way in which cigarette smoke is lit the rain soaked roads at night the heavily shadowed interiors and the lines of shadow created by louvred doors across people s faces michael williams nicolas cage an injured war veteran without money or a job stops off at a bar in red rock wyoming and is mistaken by the proprietor wayne brown j t walsh for a hit man that he s arranged to employ to murder his wife suzanne lara flynn boyle michael a naturally reticent person does nothing to disabuse wayne of his misapprehension especially as he could use a job and at first doesn t realise what he d be expected to do after having been told what his mission is and been given a advance he goes to see suzanne and warns her about wayne s plan she doesn t seem overly concerned about the danger she s in and offers michael double the fee wayne had offered for him to eliminate her husband michael decides to take the money he d received from both parties and leave town his plan fails however when he accidentally drives into a man who is standing in the middle of the road and decides to take him to hospital to receive treatment for his injuries at the hospital things get more complicated when it emerges that the patient is suzanne s lover and he has two bullets in his stomach this leads to the local law enforcement officers getting involved and the revelation that wayne is the sheriff from this point on things get even more complicated and also decidedly more dangerous especially when the real hit man lyle from dallas dennis hopper arrives on the scene red rock west has some great moments of suspense an example of this is the scene in which michael makes his escape from wayne s bar and also some great performances from its very strong cast nicolas cage s expressions are extremely natural and convincing as he reacts to a variety of situations with anxiety surprise or uncertainty and j t walsh is also particularly good as a deceptive character who s always concealing more than he s actually saying dennis hopper is intensely threatening as the vicious contract killer a role he plays with great gusto and lara flynn boyle looks suitably cold and calculating as the femme fatale dwight yoakam also provides some good support and moments of humour in his cameo role as a no nonsense truck driver incredibly red rock west was originally destined to be denied a general cinema release but has justifiably emerged from its modest beginnings to eventually be recognised as the great movie that it really is
spider man is in my opinion the best superhero ever and this game is the best superhero game ever while it may be somewhat easy you have to play it several times to get all the costumes and comic book covers which makes up for how easy it is to get through the game it may seem hard to control at first but once you get the hang of it you will be web slinging like spider man himself the bosses while like the levels are somewhat easy are fun the first boss scorpion is incredibly easy to beat which shouldn t be so because as fans of the comic books know scorpion is one of spider man s most deadly villains the second boss rhino is also very easy the rd boss is venom who is in my opinion the easiest boss in the game which definately shouldn t be the th boss is venom again this time he is a little bit more difficult to beat but still easy the th boss is mysterio who i think is the funnest boss to battle in the game he is also one of the harder bosses but once again still fairly easy next boss is carnage who is you guessed it easy to beat but carnage is actually kind of fun to fight th boss is doctor octopus who is like all the other bosses easy but not as easy as the other ones because he has a shield the th and final boss is exclusive to the game never in a comic book or cartoon i won t spoil it for you for those of you who haven t played the game but the boss is the only boss in the game that isn t too easy took me or tries to beat while the others i beat on the first or second tries all in all a very good game i gave it an out of the reasons why i didn t give it a or are that once you get all the costumes and comic book covers it gets kind of boring getting all that stuff will take a while though it is not very accurate according to the comic books or cartoon show the bosses are too easy and they should have used hobgoblin and or green goblin as a boss i think it would be fun to battle someone flying around in the air they didn t use them in the sequel to this game either well the green goblin is the villain in the upcoming spider man movie so hopefully they will make a video game based on the movie
a pretty memorable movie of the animals killing people variety specifically similar to willard in that it stars an aging character actor in this case a step down a bit to the level of les tremayne who puts in the only distinguished performance i ve seen him give in a role as a man whose life is unbalanced and who subsequently decides to use his animal friends to exact revenge on those who have wronged him yes this is one of those movies where pretty much everybody is despicable so that you will cheer when they die and really the selection of actors locations etc couldn t be better at giving the film an atmosphere of shabby decadence tremayne s character is snakey bender and he is certainly the most interesting thing about the movie an aged snake collector who is obsessed with john philip souza s music when the local preacher clamps down on his practice of collecting small animals from the local schoolchildren as bait for his snakes and his friend gets married to a stripper thus upsetting his ritual wednesday night band concert he goes on the rampage in the process creating a memorable pile up of clunkers beneath the cliff where he dumps the wrecks after disposing of their unfortunate owners one amusing game you can play while watching snakes is to place bets on which cars will land the farthest down the cliff all in all very cheap and exploitative but will really be a lot of fun for fans of these kinds of movies
i saw this at the theater in the early s the most memorable and scary scene is when the german army attacks with yellow cross mustard gas for the first time the germans and their horses are covered from head to toe or hoof with eerie protective suits the experienced british soldiers don gas masks only and once again await the clouds of gas and the german attackers the gas clouds move ever closer finally enveloping the british defenders the germans move forward slowly menacingly in their scary looking garb suddenly a scream from the defenders this gas is like no other that they have experienced before now you will know why i have remembered this scene for the last years and still shiver i think that you will too
what is so taboo about love people seem to have major problems with the transgenered the title of this movie didn t catch my eye it was a grainy shot about minutes into the movie is what made me stop channel surfing i could not believe how freaking amazing this film was it touches on so many levels of human emotion that it did not once fail to move me in some way it is by far one of the best independent films i have ever seen i did not view these characters as either gender just human i would recommend it to anyone who loves movies especially independent films praise to all fearless filmmakers
of all the british imperialist movies like four feathers charge of the light brigade for example this movie stands out as the cream of the crop it reflects a time when the sun never set on the british empire get over it i won t go into why because so many others have expressed the many reasons that makes this film great i have visited the alabama hills and have photographed the pass through which the british marched and it remains as it was unchanged by time and encroachment by man and vandals and even though i know it s coming seeing din lying dead on a stretcher and when these lines are read yes din din din you lazarushian leather gunga din though i ve belted you and flayed you by the livin gawd that made you you re a better man than i am gunga din i still at years of age get misty eyed and anyone who says they don t is a liar the range of emotions within it is the mark of a great movie like the ending of another great film of mice and men
not only is this a great african american classic comedy but one of many great american cult classics i have recently purchased the collection edition of rudy ray moore if you love the old school karate movies and black comedies this is for you they don t make movies like these anymore my entire family are movie buffs so this site is an extreme help on solving many debates i am deployed in iraq right now this helps me to stay connected to world that i know in the states thank you imdb i recommend this site to all my friends dolemite rules don t just take my word for it check them out for yourself ten lines is a lot for commenting on one movie i think but if it gets the point across i m all for it
this little film had long been on my keeper list do people realize how stressed out menopausal emotionally abused women as well as the mentally retarded were really treated by the medical profession at the turn of the century all of the pious uptight christian attitudes of that time were deadly to exploring true emotional feelings that would allow us to embrace suffering souls let alone explore what it means to embrace our humanity can you really imagine by today s standards that walt whitman s books were banned because he acknowledged women as having feelings and emotional responses as great as a mans think about that the sensitivity of this movie still gets me and i give credit to the director for capturing this through his eyes
freebird is the perfect marriage of road trip comedy gang caper stoner film and feel good british movie it is the brilliant lead characters that set this movie apart from other films in this genre stars phil daniels gary stretch and geoff bell have a great chemistry and make their characters hugely likable and realistic the main story centres around their road trip from london to wales and the adventures and mishaps that occur along the way this small film also has a great heart it is not just for bike fans as it bases around the character s relationships with each other including dreams and regrets such as gary stretch s fred longing for the family he left behind the cinematography is also great a love letter to the welsh countryside as well as capturing the grittiness of london streets and typical pub life in the welsh country towns stylish slick fantastic soundtrack likable characters and funny storyline i would recommend freebird in a heartbeat
the best thing about this movie is that it is fun it is full of humorous characters and interesting situations starting with the blithe innocent pecker played appealingly by edward furlong who likes to photograph almost everything he sees in every day life other great characters include pecker s friend matt he s a thief but he s really a nice guy pecker s sister chrissy who is addicted to sugar and pecker s catholic grandmother who discovers life in a statuette of the virgin mary in her room the movie gently makes a point about how every day life has many riches to offer and it succeeds in making this point without being too heavy handed about it there is always a risk when making messages about the value and dignity of common people of sliding into a kind of reverse holier than thou but pecker avoids these traps allowing the audience to get the point while allowing enough breathing room for viewers to compare this message to their own thoughts on the subject i recommend the movie mostly because it is a lot of fun
i saw this movie at the palm springs international film festival and it is a movie and not a film since it apparently was shot by hbo to be shown on their cable network sometime this year this movie presents page as a bondage and discipline fetish pinup and b d stag film actress who had enough talent to become a real actress page was a little more than that and the film touches on some of her other roles in modeling but not enough to balance out the career of the s pinup icon this film is supposedly based on the book the real bettie page by richard foster it s shot in black and white for that s nostalgia feel i have the book called bettie page the life of a pinup legend that has a lot of great photos chronicling the career of page and i must say that this movie reproduces on film with gretchen mol as page many of those famous photo s very accurately mol herself with the bettie page black wig and brown contact lenses is bettie page not only does she have the bettie page look but she has the smile and characteristics of her personality that came through the camera down perfect and her body is as close to a replica of page s as possible terrific casting the story is kind of thin and tabloidesque and certainly could have been a lot better but this is a pretty good tv movie i would rate it a of a scale of and recommend it s viewing when it comes on tv
you will marvel at the incredibly sophisticated computer animation and the novelty probably won t wear off on the first second or third viewing but you ll be drawn in by the characters which are so simple yet intriguing that you may find yourself actually caring for them in an unexpected way which may or may not make you feel a little childish due to the medium disney continues to firmly hold the title of greatest animation in the world with a bug s life standing as one of their greatest achievements one of the innovative attachments being the delightful out takes added to the end of the film the dvd has two sets of these out takes where as i m told the vhs cassette has one alternating version per tape the dvd also features gerry s game which is a delightful little pixar short that was also shown prior to the film in theaters this is by far the superior insect film in comparison to dreamworks antz which in all fairness is pretty good but lacks something in the animation and in the story development and characters if you look at the star voices of both films antz is largely cast with big name movie stars with a few familiar tv star voices where a bug s life is just the opposite loaded with tv stars with kevin spacey as the only stand out exception but the difference in quality is distinct and obvious dreamworks can t be blamed or surprised though when you go head to head with disney you have your work cut out for you this is the kind of film that almost makes me wish i had children to share it with don t think for a second that this is just a movie for kids though
i love and admire the farrelly brothers how come i only got to see this great movie years after it s release it made me laugh it made me cry and it reeeaally warmed my heart big time it s hard to describe in my rotten english but i have to try anyway the cast is excellent throughout from the lead to the supporting roles the acting is great the dialogs are great and the film is perfectly directed and edited i think that the farrelly brothers movies are often underestimated they are not light comedies they re deeeeeep they talk about what life is all about i won t tell you in my case this movie affirmed to me what relationships are all about if you love somebody set them free let them be try to share the passion and the pain and always be true to each other i m not a sports hater but definitely a sports ignorant but in this movie the vibes get you i could smell the atmosphere of baseball finally this movie explained to me what being a sports fan can mean to you and what cool fan families there must be out there thanks so much pete bob p s if you haven t seen it please check out kingpin
one of the best comedians ever i ve seen this show about times and will probably watch it at least more my friends and family quote from this dvd so often you d think we did nothing other than watch it the beginning part about alcatraz is a little bit slow but either wade through it or zip on through to the part where eddie is on stage watch for the cake or death part joking about the church of england and the hitler pol pot part hard to explain just watch it the best part of the show may be eddie s facial expressions he can really say a lot with his eyes mascara eyeliner and eyeshadow probably help huh fair warning eddie does have a tendency to throw a lot of four letter words in
i would not have known about this film if not for its surprise oscar nomination for best animated feature film thankfully it came to pass that i was able to watch this animated little treasure the story is about the child brendan who was the nephew of the imposing and overprotective abbot of the township of kells the main pre occupation of the abbot is to build a wall to protect kells from the attacking vikings one day aiden the renowned illustrator from iona sought refuge with them aiden opens brendan s eyes to the art of illustration and the lure of the outside world along the way brendan befriended the white forest sprite aisling as he sought to recover an ancient crystal invaluable to the meticulous art of book illustration the secret of kells is unlike most of the animation released these days it is a throwback of sorts as the illustrations are done in stark geometric lines and design without much care for realism as much as symbolism the movements of these lines are reminiscent of the simplistic yet fluid animation style used at the beginning sequence of kung fu panda however it is the magnificent use of color that is the main source of wonderment for the audience the reds used in the viking invasion sequence is unforgettably haunting try to catch this quiet gem of a film it is a welcome respite from all the senseless bombast of current animated fare such as monsters vs aliens and the like the sparse celtic musical score is effective in evoking the sense of fantasy that imbues the film ok the story might be a little shallow and the ending a bit wanting i would have liked to know more about the book that brendan and aiden was working on but the clear star of this film is clearly its amazing stylized artwork said to be based on the artwork in the real book of kells
if you ve ever seen the trailer for the film the recruit with colin farrell and al pacino you ll never have to see that film sadly renaissance has had similarly revelatory trailer makers the story of renaissance is about a detective investigating the kidnapping of a young woman and medical researcher the setting is a futuristic paris and science fiction elements feature throughout the special thing about renaissance though is its visual style and not its story renaissance is d computer animation like final fantasy but highly stylised into black and white with ultra sharp contrasts the result looks stunning although the problems of d animation of human beings are still noticeable from time to tome slightly robotic movements slightly wooden facial acting etc as a highly stylised beautiful film noir renaissance succeeds at stunning the audience especially visually the story and writing though are not quite at the same level of quality as the visuals it s not a bad story and presumably if you haven t seen the trailer it s a lot more exciting than it was for me but it is a story that isn t highly original and verges on the corny a few lines of dialogue were painfully corny making the writing sound like a beginner s first efforts i will definitely recommend renaissance to friends it s unlike anything i ve seen before visually and i believe its originality alone makes it a worthwhile experience it is also a watchable story even if it isn t perfect
i watched this film so many times through my child hood that even to this day i can pretty much re sight all of the dialogue and when i watch it now it just makes me happy and surprisingly still laugh i think it s amazing how they managed to train animals especially the cat to the extent that they are able to play the main role of a feature film however watching it now i can also unfortunately notice that it isn t the masterpiece i once thought it was but i prefer to remember how i felt about it when i was younger watching it on vhs on my fist tv that would cloud the image in yellow and and bearing in mind it is a children s film that is why i would still definitely give it
it has only been a week since i saw my first john waters film female trouble and i wasn t sure what to expect the second time around while the previous film was outrageously over the top pecker is actually a funny film that satirizes the art critics in new york to a t anyone who cannot imagine what these experts find so appealing about modern art will enjoy seeing these pretentious snobs get so full of themselves over pecker a boy who just found a broken camera and starts shooting his friends and neighbors edward furlong pet sematary ii terminator judgment day was surprisingly good as pecker there wasn t a lot of meat on any of the roles in this film but he really shines christina ricci prozac nation comes in with another great performance as pecker s girlfriend in fact it was a banner year for ricci buffalo the opposite of sex and pecker lili taylor who had the only good role in the haunting was also a significant part of the film and really made it enjoyable there are many funny scenes but i have to say the best was when a crown gathers screaming we want bush we want bush we want bush i thought it was a republican convention until i saw the police hauling off the dancer i am going to have to look for more of waters work especially hairspray now that that is in the news
as an native of bolton this film has obvious appeal for me the location shots are fascinating and show a bolton very much in transition there are a number of scenes of apparent dereliction but this serves to show the town being rebuilt and the idea that the old must make way for the new is right at the heart of this film a slightly miscast james mason leads an enjoyable ensemble in a story about a fuss over a herring that spirals into a full blown generational conflict then a pleasingly schmaltzy resolution though i m a bit too young to remember it fully the minutiae of lancashire life in the s is all here cashing up on a friday songs round the piano the sunday constitutional good neighbourliness the trepidations of courtship the massive importance of self respect and i was pleased to see naughton s funniest lines from the play left intact there is no doubt that this film ought to be made available on dvd it is well crafted and most performances are well realised
i m no big fan of martial arts movies but the video shop was nearly empty and jet li was in lethal weapon and i got it free when the other films i d rented either way i rented it i absolutely loved it my flatmate and myself year old biochemistry and accountancy students spent the half hour after the film making strange kung fu noises and throwing beermat shurikens at each other i can t explain it well maybe a little tequila i never enjoyed bruce lee skinny bloke kicking big bloke beating him kicking bigger bloke etc film ends think jackie chan with a little less comedy and more action
i just saw this cartoon for the first time and recognized the caricatures of famous black entertainers cab calloway bessie smith not josephine baker or sophie tucker who was white thomas fats waller bill bojangles robinson stepin fetchit notwithstanding louis armstrong and the chorus girls are out of the famed cotton club in harlem true stereotypes are there but this was the way it was and these cartoons were meant as adult entertainment at your local cinema before the main feature harmann ising cartoons tended to be more cutesy and more upscale after all we are talking about m g m than the standard animated short done over at warners paramount universal fox rko or lowly columbia even disney s very early mickey mouse had loads of barnyard humor before uncle walt cleaned him up just before he went technicolor disney had some cartoons with caricatures of black entertainers as well for example s silly symphony woodland cafe but we have to remember that these films are part of a certain time and place years from now clips of the simpsons family guy and south park will be also scrutinized analyzed and even vilified by future viewers
culled from the real life exploits of chuck connors and steve brodie in s new york the bowery is high energy and good natured but be warned casual racial epithets flow off the tongues of wallace beery and little jackie cooper the very first shot might be startling this is true to the time it was set and the time it was made and it also speaks to the diversity of population in that neck of the woods it certainly adds to the gritty flavor of the atmosphere beery as connors is the blustering thunder at the center of the action a loud mouth saloon keeper with his own fire brigade and he has a soft spot for ornery orphan cooper raft as brodie is connors slicker better looking rival in almost every endeavor brodie could never turn down a dare and loved attention leading up to a jump off the brooklyn bridge it is still debated whether he actually jumped or used a dummy beery is as bombastic as ever with a put on irish american accent he is just the gruff sort of character to draw children cats and ladies in distress this is possibly the most boisterous character raft ever played and he even gets to throw in a little dancing as well as a show of leg and again he mistakes the leading lady lovely fay wray for a prostitute cooper is as tough as either of them though he gets a chance to turn on the tears the highlight isn t the jump off the bridge but a no holds barred fistfight between connors and brodie that in closeup looks like a real brawl between the principals it s sure someone bruised more than an ego
dressed to kill is surely one of the best horror thriller movies ever made it s taut stylish and extremely suspenseful mixture of sex and violence the acting is pretty good the orchestral score by pino donaggio is unforgettable and there s plenty of surprises to keep thriller fans intrigued dressed to kill is a murder mystery that involves a sexually frustrated housewife angie dickinson her teenage son keith gordon her psychoanalyst michael caine and a high price call girl nancy allen the murderer in the film is a transsexual named bobbi who is also one of caine s patients the film is full of breathtaking moments the infamous elevator murder scene is extremely stylish and pretty gory as well highly recommended
izzard was both hysterical and insightful in his humor he definitely represents his own little niche in the comedic world it s a pity more americans won t see this stand up routine due to its pal only availability
it s a cooking competition show americanized it s not going to be the japanese version the show is great i could care less about cooking but this show is just entertaining to watch from the intensity put into the dishes by the chef to the goofy chairman truly a good way to spend some time watching tv you could critique the show for having guests like marc ecko as a judge but meh it s entertaining enough to watch and generally the winner deserves the prize oh yeah and i m bitter john besh isn t the new iron chef ala cuisine
but this is a great martial arts film liu chia liang ranks second to none as a fight choreographer only sammo hung at his best compares this is immediately clear from his proud exhibition of technique rather than flashy camera angles etc during fights the direction is tightly controlled to not only excite the viewer by the speed and movement but to awe her with the precise skill displayed this film benefits also from liu s participation in front of the camera liu s performance at the banquet scene with which the film opens is one of the high points in kung fu movie history liu is supported by the beautiful and talented hui ying hung of my young auntie fame and hsiao hou whose acrobatics are breathtaking and preferable to any amount of wirework as for the plot this film follows the not uncommon theme of revenge but with character and moral development along the way and a most fitting resolution the humour in this is also of the best if you only watch one kung fu film ever this would be a good choice it has it all
first off this really is my favorite film ever i don t need to give anyone a description because every a hole does that i am literally obsessed with this practically bloodless cheesy lame effects having boom stick showing badly edited s metal horror masterpiece the director i heard had hoped for a hit at the box office so that he could do sequels and have a freddy jason type of deal for himself damn i wish that could ve went down like that the soundtrack s banging the acting s good check this mofo out and any die hard fans out there feel free to email and chat sometime midgetorgy i can be found at yahoo
thirty years after its initial release the third version of a star is born finally comes to dvd in a package that should please the most devoted fans of barbra streisand that would include me since i just saw her in concert singing among other numbers the feminist anthem woman in the moon from this film easy to dismiss the movie s career polarizing story is such a sturdy pile of hollywood style clich s that variations of it exist in other films including streisand s own funny girl this time reset to the then contemporary music scene the timeworn plot follows self destructive rock star john norman howard on his deep dive career descent just as he meets club singer esther hoffman who is awaiting her big break troubles dog their courtship from the outset as john norman both names please responds to grasping fans and bloodless djs with random acts of violence from which he inexplicably escapes prosecution to john norman esther represents his last shot at happiness and in turn she is drawn to the innately decent creative musician underneath the fa ade in the movie s most pivotal scene he gives esther her big break at a benefit concert and her career takes off inevitably he can t handle the failure of his career in light of her meteoric success and if you are familiar with any version of this story you know the rest directed by frank pierson although streisand s budding directorial talents are obviously on display the film still manages to draw me in even though i know it is shamelessly contrived and manipulative it still has a certain emotional resonance despite its numerous flaws although streisand in her prime seems like the ideal choice to play a rising singing star her screen persona is simply too strong and predefined to play esther credibly the same can be said for her performing style since the script seems to make allowances for her softer adult contemporary oriented material to be accepted within the otherwise hardened world of arena rock from the moment she pops her head up as the middle of the oreos she can t help but come across as an established star i can forgive the lapse simply because she is an unparalleled vocal talent but what becomes less forgiving is how she makes esther more strident than poignant when john norman s woes become overwhelming this creates an oddly discomfiting dynamic in the last part of the film when it becomes less about what caused the climactic event than esther s response to it this is capped off by an uninterrupted eight minute close up of her memorial performance great except when she regrettably mimics john norman s style toward the end kristofferson on the other hand gives a superb performance throughout managing a level of honesty that grounds the film and makes palpable his concurrent feelings of love pride and resentment toward esther he makes his vodka soaked onstage growling work within this context otherwise what always strikes me as strange about this version is how all the supporting characters are relegated to the background as if they didn t exist unless they were interacting with the two principals the only ones who register are paul mazursky as john norman s level headed manager brian and gary busey as his cynical band manager bobbie veteran cameraman robert surtees provides a nice burnish to the cinematography though a level of graininess persists in the print a big seller in its day the soundtrack is a hodgepodge of different styles from the s some songs still quite good everything woman in the moon watch closely now some that have moved to kitsch queen bee kenny loggins i believe in love and of course the inescapable evergreen the print transfer on the dvd is clean and the sound gratefully crisp thanks to digital remastering streisand s participation is the chief lure of the extras beginning with her feature length commentary she gives insightful information about the genesis of the film the casting and the reportedly troubled production she is also refreshingly candid about the megalomania of jon peters her hairdresser boyfriend who became the movie s producer and her dissatisfaction with pierson as a director i just wish she could have provided more scene specific comments that directly relate to what is on screen she also tends to repeat the same anecdotes when the mood strikes her e g it gets tiring to hear for the third time how the person playing the chauffeur was a friend of peters i think having a second commentator could have drawn out other nuggets from her there is a wardrobe test reel that shows some amusing s clothes especially kristofferson s mixed fabric poncho and orange polyester shirt there are also twelve deleted scenes included with streisand s optional commentary one is a comic bread baking scene which reminded me how much i like streisand in farcical comedies another is an extended scene in which she plays evergreen on the guitar in front of an awestruck kristofferson who then falls asleep the most interesting is an alternate take on the musical finale incorporating fast cuts which i agree with streisand should have been used fittingly the theatrical trailers for all three versions of a star is born are also included
don t get me wrong goldeneye was revolutionary and is definitely the best fps game to be based on the franchise but the series had fallen into a fps rut enter everything or nothing which puts bond in third person when i wrote my earlier review for from russia with love i had finished frwl and just started eon and judged eon a bit harshly even though frwl definitely has the edge in nostalgia and capturing the essence of the movie franchise eon definitely is superior in terms of in depth controls and gameplay variety missions range from standard running and gunning to driving an suv driving an aston martin driving a limousine that is wired to explode commandeering two different types of tanks a la goldeneye riding a motorcycle flying a helicopter repelling down a shaft guarded by laser tripwires and free falling after a plummeting damsel sure vehicle controls are a little clumsy but the issue here is the variety as movie adaptations goldeneye and frwl were all that i could have hoped for but eon s original storyline adds to the feeling of controlling a james bond adventure this is helped by the impressive cast list of willem defoe shannon elizabeth heidi klum and misaki ito judi dench and john cleese reprise their movie roles of m and q respectively and pierce brosnan while no sean connery adds credibility to the game s proceedings all characters resemble the stars with the disappointing exception of heidi klum who s in game model doesn t do the real life model justice mya s theme song is on par with at least some of the big screen bond title tunes the game also plays tribute to some of the older bond movies willem defoe s character is a former colleague of christopher walken s baddie from a view to a kill richard kiel appears as jaws the hulking henchman from the spy who loved me and moonraker in three fight scenes the first and best of which proceeds in the same fashion a fight in the movies would have single player gameplay mainly consists of standard on foot missions as bond like bond you will be able to choose whether to use stealth or go out with guns blazing the game provides plenty of opportunities to utilize stealth with plenty of wall and object cover unfortunately unlike frwl only one button in eon controls both crouching and wall clinging so bond may end up crouching low when he s supposed to be peeking around a corner and vice versa the game also allows players to go into bond reflex mode while you browse your inventory everything around you will go into super slo mo allowing you to analyze objects around you that can be interacted with while this takes some getting used to eventually this mode will allow you to perform many spectacular bond moments such as shooting down a chandelier to take out four goons underneath and greatly add to the bond movie feeling there are available difficulty levels operative agent and double oh on operative you can breeze through in a few hours on agent a few weeks on double oh a few months the difficulty level can be changed for each individual mission garnering high scores on missions will unlock gold and platinum awards and effect features such as vehicle upgrades and the skimpy outfits the bond girls wear some missions can be extremely frustrating due to a scarcity of checkpoints but when all is said and done no mission is any longer than a single action scene in a bond movie multi player unfortunately is not as thrilling goldeneye still has the best multi player mode of any bond game eon s main multi player is a co op campaign mode that puts players in charge of lesser mi agents on a less important mission than bond s a more standard third person death match can be unlocked from this mode but the single player mode is the most complete bond experience to date the ending as with most bond games is anticlimactic while the final mission is one of the most aggravating of the game the final confrontation with the villain is disappointing also levels that require bond to be speedy become largely a matter of trial and error still for any serious bond fan not playing this game is tantamount to missing one of the bond films
unique movie about confused woman lindsay crouse who gets involved with sharp con men joe mantegna gives an oscar caliber performance as the slickest of the group absolutely enchanting first hour as mantegna shows crouse the ropes of his con games story line unravels a bit later on but still stands as a unique portrayal of an innocent caught up in a dark world definitely worth a shot
a nicely done thriller with plenty of sex in it i saw it on late night tv there are two hardcore stars in it lauen montgomery and venus thankfully gabriella hall has just a small part
pinjar is a genuinely good film with great acting good narrative good presentation touching emotions etc it seems to me that the quality of films that bollywood is producing is quite improving these days and this film is one evidence no bollywood movie that i can remember of made such an impact on me i was literally thinking about the movie for hours marvelling at the various emotional situations that test the human in a human the film rests on the great acting of urmilla matondkar and also some from manoj bajpai urmilla plays a girl in north india in the background of the partition and all troubles seem sweet if compared with the problems she happens to face a must see film a technically superior bollywood product which i feel is comparable to the best movies coming out of other countries in the world
the last hard men is a typical western for the s most of them seem to be inspired by sam peckinpah also this one but director andrew mclaglan is a john ford pupil and this can be obviously shown in many scenes imo the beginning is very good in a certain way mclaglan wanted to show the audience a travel from the civilization to the wilderness in the third part there are some illogical flaws and i complain a bit about charlton heston he has to play an old ex lawman named sam burgade but he is in a fantastic physical shape i never got the feeling that he really has problems to climb on a horse or on a rock for me he didn t looks very motivated as he usual do in most of his epic movies same goes to the beautiful barbara hershey who is playing the sheriff s daughter maybe both had troubles with the director or were unhappy with their roles hershey and coburn are not showing their best but they are still good if the scriptwriter had john wayne in their mind as sam burgade also michael parks as modern sheriff is a bit underused in his role on the other hand there is james coburn as outlaw zach provo coburn is a really great villain in this one he is portraying the bad guy between maniac hate and cleverness his role and his acting is the best of the movie landscapes and shootouts are terrific the shootings scenes are bloody and the violence looks realistic zach provo and his gang had some gory and violent scenes what i miss is the typical western action in the middle of the movie i would have appreciated a bank robbery or something similar overall it s an entertaining western flick not a great movie but above the average because of a great coburn a very good beginning and some gory and violent scenes
i saw this film while at birmingham southern college in when it was shown in combination with the red balloon both films are similar in their dream like quality the bulk of the film entails a fish swimming happily in his bowl while his new owner a little boy is away at school a cat enters the room where the fish and his bowl are and begins to warily stalk his prey the boy begins his walk home from school and the viewer wonders whether he will arrive in time to save his fish friend the fish becomes agitated by the cat s presence and finally jumps out of the bowl the cat quickly walks over to the fish gently picks him up with his paws and returns him to his bowl the boy returns happily to his fish none the wiser the ending is amazing in both its irony and its technical complexity it is hard to imagine how the director could ve pulled the technical feat back in it seems more a trick for if you can find it watch it you won t be disappointed and if you do find it let me know so i can get a copy too
the bourne ultimatum begins recklessly mid chase and in pulse pounding fashion explodes from there as jason bourne matt damon absolutely superb tracks down the masterminds behind the cia black ops that turned him into the perfect killer in a final attempt to learn his true identity a devastatingly icy david strathairn as the man behind the curtain is added to the returning cast of regulars including joan allen excellent and julia stiles non existent like the second entry in the series i wished paul greengrass shaky hand held camera would go static at least for the few minutes of downtime however that being said it s a perfect way to capture the tense claustrophobic feel of the intimate hand to hand combat scenes and works equally well in the chase scenes which are mostly on foot and across rooftops with the occasional big car pile up part of the fun of the bourne series is the constant globe hopping and manipulation of technology and communications that seem to defy the laws of physics and current capabilities the bourne films seem to exist in some sort of gritty hyper reality that is full of technological based magic it makes no sense that everyone seems to be just in the right place at the right time but i ll be damned if it isn t a blast to watch them get there with the absence of the emotive and involving franka potente the writers attempt to create some emotional connection between damon and stiles but she is so blank faced an actress it never really leads to anything still this can be forgiven for unlike the identity and the supremacy this ultimatum reveals all and we finally learn the truth about bourne s past it s an entertaining and satisfying conclusion to the series and if they have any good sense and damon gets his wish this will be the perfect end to it
there are too many new styles of the sitcom but the one that works best is the old fashioned way with an audience and indoor set that s show is a great example when the show came on the air nobody really heard of kurtwood smith and debra jo rupp much less the adolescents played wonderfully by topher grace and ashton kushton both of them are leaving the show this year to pursue other interests i wish topher would stay around because the show began about his character eric and his close circle of friends ashton is already the john travolta of our time remember when john was in love with diana hyland from eight is enough think of ashton with demi moore the cast of actors were never known to us which is a good thing because a celebrity cast member can spoil it i miss mo gaffney who played don s girlfriend joanne i miss lisa robin kelly as the original laurie the replacement could not match her and i am sorry about that i liked the casting of tommy chong as the wasted but beloved father figure to steven hyde i loved watching tanya roberts besides charlie s angels i loved brooke shields playing jackie s mom she really showed her acting talent before heading to broadway this show has been a delight with many surprises i hope this show lasts longer even though of their cast members are leaving but i hope they don t stay too far away too long i wish the show s creators bonnie and terry turner who also created my other favorite show third rock from the sun is more successful on fox than they were on nbc which sabotaged their show the turners are not dummies and i hope they create more shows like this in the future
no hidden agenda pure scifi all fun i saw the original on tv and was scared pretty bad i was a kid the original one can be appreciated more when compared to the new one which i saw and have forgotten the original one starring the great movie star steve mcqueen bullet is by far the better and only version anyone should see the movie production is dated but the fx used to make the blob stands up the test of time i was convinced that that thing was moving on its own accord zafoid
just finished watching the groove tube which i first saw about years ago when i was a teenager staying up way past my bedtime watching hbo with my brother and his best friend we had also watched animal house just before that so we saw two movies that starred an snl alumna and had some naked breasts good thing our parents were asleep the whole time anyway there were lots of weird and funny things in this movie that were eye openers like the brown sequence of the uranus industries commercial with the taste of beef stew says the announcer as what is apparently human excrement comes out of a white tube ewww or the face of the puppet talking about vd a scrotum with a small penis with eyes glued on chevy chase and richard belzer made their feature film debuts here chase is hilarious whether doing a geritan spot with a woman stripping having his hands have sex in a let fingers do it commercial or singing four leaf clover with co writer director ken shapiro drumming his hands on his head belzer teams with shapiro in the dealers movie and on channel one evening news with one wild bit having belzer as a black prostitute trying tricks on reporter ken who plays lionel here lionel that sounds like a train that i m going to ride like a choo choo other outrageous bits include the koko show with shipiro as a kid clown show host who after ordering the people over ten to leave the room reads requests of his viewers like passages of fanny hill or how about the olympics segment with a german couple making love being announced by two men one of them spanish as they get explicit while please stand by keeps interrupting on the screen or the animated segment on the dealers which depicts dancing toilets after shapiro ingested some marijuana not everything s so dirty besides the four leaf clover skit at the end there s a highly amusing music segment with ken lip syncing his own recording of just you just me while dancing with suit and briefcase around the city with occasionally a cop co writer lane sarasohn joining in so in summation this is one weirdly funny movie that seemed to influence other like films tunnelvision kentucky fried movie and possibly saturday night live which made chevy that show s first star and despite some dated elements can still amuse today p s while i liked hearing curtis mayfield s move on up during the gorillas dancing hitchhiking beginning sequence i did wonder what the point was with the sequence of the hitchhiker and the woman who picked him up having them running from the car stripping on the run and then having the naked man get caught by the cop who stopped on the road guess it s one of those s streaking things
note these comments are for people who have seen the movie vanilla sky is a brilliant complex and thrilling movie that existentially explores exactly what the tag line says lovehatedreamslifeworkplayfriends maybe the movie plot can come into focus for confused movie goers if one looks at it from a different angle considering the following now i have not painstakingly gone through the film scene by scene so i will have to further examine my assertions and i welcome your thoughts but give this a try and see if the movie doesn t fall into place where exactly does the debatable splice occur now i m not talking about the splice as it is explained by the l e technician since that sequence itself could be actually interpreted as a rationalization inside of david aames s mind dream coma state but the true splice between reality and dream it seems to me that the reality of the car crash the way that it is filmed no explosion for example is a likely splice point and that any particular sequence containing an existential dream coma non reality feel to it whether it s shown onscreen before or after the crash is actually a part of aames personal journey toward self realization inside of his own mind in that respect then we are left with two questions at the very end if you know of more let me know is aames actually disfigured and where does he wake up if you don t get entirely wrapped up in the exact sequence of details in the plot or at what particular point his dreams are scattered throughout this movie becomes a fascinating exploration of a human on a journey to find himself and what that means in today s pop culture society

i read a small ad in some horror magazine in the early nineties about liebe des totes the love of the dead or something similar this of course awoke my curiosity so i ordered nekromantik and der todesking the death king the nekromantik movies are ok even kind of interesting and unique in their approach to the subject necrophilia even if they obviously are horror opera entries rather than intended to invoke fear in the viewers mind they are actually quite funny todesking on the other hand is in my opinion one of the best films ever made it consist of a series of scenes depicting the many facets of death death as an enemy death as a reliever death as the very fysical decomposition of the body the film is a metaphor over life it shows how fragile life is and how short our lives are it reduces its viewers to the childs they we actually are the fact that we cannot really understand the nature of death and hence neither the process of dying is the core message of the film this is a most realistic film never does buttgereit try to hide death behind white roses or whatever no matter what moral standards you set up death is unevitable and will sooner or later be not a fiction but your reality this applies to you dear reader like it applies to the viewers of the film some juvenile reviewers seem not to grasp this which is fully excused since they of course will live forever this is no exploitation movie why because death does not exploit us humans it harvests us we grow for seven days then we are brought back to the schopenhauerian state of pre birth that is death buttgereit gives us his version of the oldest of tales whether you choose to regard it as optimistic or pessimistic is up to you at first glance it may seem very dark consider though that in order for something to live something else must die who wants to live forever i believe that when buttgereit shows a body that are being consumed by maggots he shows not only decomposition but generation of new life is it not better to die and give life to maggots and then birds and eventually become soil than to remain the living dead zombie that is one of the the favorite pets of the genre when you realize this you see der todesking it its right context sieben tage hat die woche siebenmal letzte stunden seven are the days of week weak mortal seven times the last hour dont fear the reaper buttgereit tells us because the reaper takes only what is ripe and apples that are not plucked for food will rot have a good life fellow imdb ers and watch this film that compares only to ingemar bergmans the seventh seal in terms of depth and universality
i have things to come on d v d and it s very clear compared to my vhs version the audio is fair but can be hard to understand at times i liked the movie so much that i searched for a copy of the book and found it it gave details of why some things happened the best things about the movie are the small things that i didn t notice at first such as john cabal playing with a toy airplane at a christmass party like it was a dive bomber out dateing sea power by naming a battleship dinosuar ships sunk by air power an undeclared enemy sneak attack by airplanes swept flying wing planes strong rolls for the women through the entire movie there are more see the movie to enjoy them
i couldn t agree more with the other comment it s like falling down peter weller is ok and william hurt great as always except in lost in space this is a good movie with pretty good performances very recommendable if you like falling down you re going to enjoy this one of

i saw this movie on comedy central a few times this movie was pretty good it s an interesting adventure with the life of sunny davis who is arranged to marry the king of ohtar so that the u s can get an army base there to balance power in the middle east some good jokes including sunnygate i also just loved the ending theme it gave me great political spirit ten out of ten was my rating for this movie
prix de beaut was made on the cusp of the changeover from silence to sound which came a little later in europe than in hollywood originally conceived as a silent it was released with a dubbed soundtrack in france with a french actress speaking louise brooks lines but was released as a silent in italy and other parts of europe i was lucky enough to see the cineteca di bologna s flawless new restoration of an italian silent print at the tribeca film festival i haven t seen the talkie version yet but i think it s safe to assume the silent version is much more satisfying since by all reports the dubbing is poorly done louise brooks is clearly speaking english so there s no way her lips could be matched also the film is made entirely in the silent style with few titles and little need for dialogue prix de beaut tells its story visually with exciting imaginative camera work the opening is instantly kinetic with rapidly cut scenes of urban life and swimmers splashing at a public beach throughout the film there is an emphasis on visual detail on clothing machinery decoration and symbolic images such as a caged bird a heap of torn photographs a diamond bracelet this is silent film technique at its pinnacle louise brooks of course is responsible for saving the film from obscurity seeing this makes it only more heartbreaking to reflect that this was her last starring role lustrously beautiful she dominates the film with her charisma and also gives a perfectly natural yet highly charged performance her role here more than in the pabst films for which she s best known is a woman we can fully understand and sympathize with she plays lucienne garnier a typist with a possessive fianc who yearns to get more out of life and secretly enters a beauty contest with immediate success she is then torn between the excitement of her glamorous new life and her love for the man who insists she give it all up or lose him all of the characters are drawn with nuance the fianc inspires pity and is not merely a brute he loves lucienne but is a limited man who can t cope with her having a life apart from him or attracting the attentions of other men even the other man in the story is not the simple slimeball we first take him for though his intentions may be just as possessive as the fianc s warning spoilers below the film has many fine set pieces including lucienne s triumph in the miss europe contest shown through the comic reactions of assorted audience members who wind up pelting the heroine with flowers her misery as a housewife peeling potatoes while the pendulum of the cuckoo clock marks time behind her a nightmarish trip to a fun fair in the silent version this occurs late in the film after her marriage at which lucienne crushed among the low lifes and depressed by her husband s macho antics decides that she can t go on with her present existence and especially the final scene in the projection room where she views her talkie screen test louise brooks may never have looked more beautiful than she does here with the projector s beam flickering on her alabaster profile her shoulders swathed in white fur her face incandescent under the black helmet of hair as she watches herself singing on screen the double shot of her exquisite corpse and her still living image on the screen is particularly poignant louise brooks image like lucienne s remains immortal despite her frustratingly aborted film career
i contend that whoever is ultimately responsible for creating approving the trailer for this movie has completely blundered no one i know wanted to see this movie based on the previews and everyone who actually saw it that i know absolutely loved it the advertising campaign is disgrace disaster blunder opened at behind rush hour which i have not seen average imdb score of the bourn ultimatum which i have seen awesome movie but rd week out average imdb score of deserving i would say the simpsons movie which i have seen okay movie but th week out average imdb score of a bit high in my opinion stardust average imdb score of lower then bourn but that s been our for weeks whether it was poor scheduling or poor advertising i think that the powers that be behind this movie screwed up big time this should have been advertised as an amazing movie that happens to be a fantasy fairytale and not advertised as just another fairytale too bad anyway now that i have very pointlessly ranted on and on awesome movie go see it
it is very hard to rate this film as entertainment value for st century viewers it fails miserably however for the student of early sound films and history it is a jewel show of shows was a revue filmed to compete with mgm s successful hollywood revue of which still survives intact complete with its technicolor scenes the purpose of the all star revue was to showcase a particular studio s silent stars in speaking roles and show that they could make the transition however warner bros seems to have forgotten this and employs many acts and stars that they didn t even have under long term contract such as ben turpin lloyd hamilton beatrice lillie and even a marching band meanwhile their biggest talent al jolson is noticeably absent even at a high salary he could not be compelled to join in almost every act is overly long and the film plays like a dozen or so vitaphone shorts strung together with no continuity the finale is also overly long but it is really enjoyable with all of its dance numbers the highlights of the film are two numbers from winnie lightner pingo pongo and singin in the bathtub a couple of numbers with nick lucas john barrymore performing shakespeare and the chinese fantasy li po li with nick lucas and myrna loy this last number is the only part of the film that survives in technicolor and it really is quite attractive reasonably enough the players in these good acts were long term warner bros stars so perhaps the director knew how to play to their strengths since he was familiar with them this film acts as a snapshot at an odd point in film history the year which was the bridge year between two eras the silent and sound eras and the roaring s and the great depression just two years later this same film would have had an entirely different cast as warner bros would abandon its silent era stars and the stars they hired just to produce the early musicals in favor of those stars that gave warner bros its distinctive urban look and feel james cagney joan blondell edward g robinson and others
i never met a single person out of hundreds who hated this movie bet that anyone who votes it down is a petty saboteur or a victim of one this film has everything ask yourself are you a fan of then go see laputa it s not my favorite movie but my favorite is directed by the same person hayao miyazaki in any case this one ranks among my top five and i ve seen a lot of movies
i was quite surprised to read some of the comments on this work honestly some people were looking for a plot ok when this video came out over a decade ago i watched it for what it was a collection of music videos it s not a movie it doesn t have a plot nor a central storyline it s a rather artistic anthology of mostly long form videos all of them rather smartly or creatively done michael jackson may be considered a freak these days but after all this was the man who gave us thriller considered by many to be the greatest music video of all time and set trends with billie jean and beat it with moonwalker he and the filmmakers and artists who collaborated with him once again took his music and dance moves to create some vividly entertaining stuff incorporating claymation special effects live performance footage and even self parody the badder sequence and for those wondering what joe pesci was doing there this video came out just a tad before he became a household name and was one of his most memorable appearances on film and imho i think the smooth criminal sequence the choreographed section beats anything else michael jackson did up to that point
i m still new to the krimi genre and the only one i ve seen prior to seeing this one was the earlier and somewhat disappointing the dead eyes of london which didn t exactly inspire a great hope for the rest of the genre in me if i d seen this one first however the feeling would have been different as while the college girl murders is a bizarre and rather wacky attempt at a crime flick it s great fun to watch and it s really hard to hate a film that throws so many weird and wonderful ideas into the script and manages to pull it off with style the film begins in a lab where a crazy scientist has invented a new and highly toxic poison that kills its victim and makes it look like they died from a heart attack this poison is used by a mysterious criminal mastermind who breaks common criminals out of jail to carry out his murders using this poison and then has them put back in jail as the title suggests it s a nearby college full of girls that provides most of the victims there s also a mysterious monk dressed in a red robe who marauds around breaking necks with a bullwhip of course with a plot like that this is not exactly a serious affair and the director clearly knows that as there is a very tongue in cheek vibe to the film which does bode well with the plot the fact that there are so many different sides to the plot does unfortunately mean that everything does not run smoothly although this isn t a big problem as things are kept ticking over nicely throughout the film and there s always enough going on to keep the audience interested the atmosphere is superb and the colour scheme on display is great too look at of course the film is based on an edgar wallace novel and clearly the man has a great imagination the locations used are also superb and while a killer s lair decked out with a host of wild and exotic animals might not serve any relevance to the plot it does help to give the film that extra something you cant expect a conclusion that fully makes sense after all the stuff that goes on in this film but the reason for the murders sort of makes sense and is a satisfying way for the film to climax overall college girl murders is an excellent little mystery flick and one that comes highly recommended
infamous pre code film really the one film that caused people to insist on the hayes code being strictly enforced barbara stanwyck stars as a young girl whose liquor selling father has no problem pimping her out to customers when he dies in an accident she s released out into the world with the knowledge that her nubile body can get her whatever she wants she goes to new york and proceeds to climb the corporate ladder one bed at a time although obviously there s no actual sex shown the film is quite sleazy unfortunately after the initial shock value fades around the time stanwyck screws a rail car inspector so she can travel for free the film becomes a tad repetitive and dull stanwyck herself is the only thing that keeps the film worth sitting through as always she s fantastic
of the three remakes on w somerset maughan s novel this one is the best one and not particularly because what john cromwell brought to the film the film is worth a look because of the break through performance by bette davis who as mildred rogers showed the film industry she was a star finally her struggles with jack warner and his studio paid off royally the film is dominated by mildred from the start we realize from the beginning that mildred doesn t care for philip and never will she doesn t hide her contempt for this kind soul that has fallen in love with the wrong woman he will be humiliated by mildred again and again as she makes no bones about what she really is poor philip carey besides of being handicap is a man who is weak when he tries to cling onto mildred she rejects him it is when mildred returns to him when she is frail and defeated that he rises to the occasion overcoming his own dependency on this terrible woman who has stolen his will and his manhood bette davis gives a fantastic portrayal of mildred this was one of her best roles and she ran away with it her disgust toward the kind philip is clear from the onset of their relationship when she tells him she washes her mouth after he kisses her is one of the most powerful moment in the movie leslie howard underplayed philip and makes him appear even weaker than he is frances dee reginald denny alan hale and reginald owen are seen in minor roles this is bette davis show and don t you forget it
a sequel to angels with dirty faces in name only the angels wash their faces suffers somewhat from the usual shenanigans of the dead end kids as a matter of fact with the presence of the dead end kids and ann sheridan this should have been treated as an actual sequel to angels with dirty faces at least for continuity s sake speaking of ann sheridan she is the one true shining light of this movie to paraphrase a clich ann sheridan could read from a phone book for two hours and i would buy the dvd another virtue of this movie is the chemistry between ann sheridan and ronald reagan unfortunately this aspect of the film is kept too far in the background for a better example of the sheridan reagan duo i would recommend juke girl or kings row
alexandr sascha luzhin john turturro is a former leading chess player attempting a comeback at an italy hosted tournament his brilliance is unquestioned but his obsession with chess has stunted his growth in all other aspects of his life natalia emily watson is a beautiful heiress who has come to the same resort with her mother vera geraldine james to scope out possible marriage partners vera leans toward a handsome count but astonishingly natalia is more fascinated by sascha whom she met on a walk sascha too is taken with natalia and proposes marriage at their second meeting but with the concentration that sascha must give to the chess matches and with other happenings in his past still causing problems will he win the heart of natalia oh and can he become the chess champion also this is a lovely film based on a novel by nabokov the acting is amazing with watson very fine as the beautiful little rich girl and turturro utter perfection as the shy awkward chess enthusiast james gives quite a nice turn as the overbearing mother and the other cast members are wonderful as well as for the look of the film it could not be better the scenery is of the put your eye out variety the vintage costumes are gorgeous and the cinematography is deserving of much applause yes the story is unusual and told with the use of flashbacks at times making it a film not everyone will appreciate then too the ending is bittersweet however if you love romance period pieces great acting knockout scenery or the fine art of motion picture creation don t miss this one you will be defenseless in resisting its multitude of charms
as the jacket proclaims this film is gorgeously shot and masterfully edited and yes it is mesmerizingly beautiful the timelessness that we perceive in stoic rock and in the unceasing ebb and flow of water frames the ephemeral works from goldsworthy s hands so that in their very ephemeralness they point to eternity and so the beauty of his compositions haunt us with just a touch of melancholy woven in or in the words of matthew arnold from dover beach listen you hear the grating roar of pebbles which the waves draw back and fling at their return up the high strand begin and cease and then again begin with tremulous cadence slow and bring the eternal note of sadness in at one point near the end of the film goldsworthy says that words do their job but what i m doing here says a lot more as a wordsmith myself i take no offense and not for a moment do i think him immodest because the combination of form and time and change and texture and color and composition that goldsworthy painstakingly and intuitively creates is indeed something more than mere words can say at another point he remarks on what is here to stay and what isn t that is his theme i think that artists sometime in the twentieth century became acutely aware of how ephemeral even the greatest works of art are compared to the vast expanse of cosmic time and so they began to reflect this understanding by composing works that were deliberately ephemeral the idea was that by emphasizing how short lived are even the mightiest works of humans a sense of the timelessness of art would be expressed perhaps part of the effectiveness of goldsworthy s work is in this sort of expression he painstakingly composes some form of straw or leaves where the tide will reach it or places it in the river where it will be swept away and in this process is merged both the composition and its ephemerality both the transitory and the timeless are necessary for us to understand our world and our place within it and it is important that these works be done within the context of nature so that what is composed is set within what is natural thus the walls of stone and the eggs of stone that goldsworthy constructs are silent and solid yet we know that they are not monuments to eternity but instead will stay for some undefined length of time and then dissipate and return to a state much like that which existed before we came along this is art as art should be akin to the spiritual in a sense goldsworthy s work is an inarticulated understanding it is an experience purely of time and form in a sense his work answers shelley s famous poem ozymandias by saying even as the tide washes the work away and even as the river dissipates the expression even so the art lives on because of our experience of it similarly one thinks of tibetan sand paintings so carefully composed and measured out and then just as they are so beautifully and preciously finished they are given to the wind so that we might know that all is flux yet in the modern world these works of art endure in photos and videos goldsworthy is an accomplished photographer of necessity i would say and all his works even the unsuccessful ones he tells us are photographed so that he can look back at them in a more reflective mood and see what he has accomplished and what he has not this cinematic production directed by thomas riedelsheimer with the beautiful and appropriately haunting music by fred frith is not to be missed it is one of the most beautiful documentaries that i have ever seen and one of the most spiritual
this is one of the greatest movies ever maybe even the greatest movie ever i had forgotten about the movie for about years until i saw an add on tv for adgth and it brought back fond memories of me watching it when i was a little kid and when i watched it a few nights ago i became addicted to the movie usually i don t like animated family movies but this one is special it is the perfect family movie the ending of the movie always touches my heart and saddens me very much but that is what makes this movie amazing better than all of the garbage that is coming out for kid movies today i mean the movie is g rated and it is about dogs who are involved with gambling there is a lot of smoking drinking murder death and hell depicted in the movie which i believe makes the movie from good to great i mean movies today don t bring reality to kids and in this movie they did rip judith barsi dom deluise
ok it s not a perfect movie by any means but i disagree with the overall imdb opinion that it s really really bad i watched a lot of hong kong flix in the s and loved the era dearly i never saw black mask at the time and only saw it last week for the first time apart from the embarrassingly poor dubbing which my dvd copy didn t give me the option to turn off the movie contains the raw energy and bravado that permeated hong kong movies during this time i still stick to my guns in the opinion that when it comes to action these guys no matter what their budget add an element of magic to the screen no bourne supremacy casino royale or mission impossible i m not knocking these movies i just reckon they lack the spontaneity of this one and feel too regulated will ever achieve what is it it s the feeling that the film makers were experimenting as they shot and edited not afraid to leave in some blemishes so as to learn lessons for the next time for me this makes watching movies all the more fun and dangerous
it s a shame that deliverance is mainly known as the redneck rape movie and for dueling banjos even people that have seen the film can t get their mind off of that rape scene it s not as bad as the rape scene in pulp fiction it s certainly not as bad as any female rape scene in just about any movie people tend to miss the power of the film that contains the infamous buggery scene the acting plot cinematography and soundtrack of deliverance all lend a hand to it s brooding charisma the backcountry it was shot in is beautiful and is quite in contrast to the dark subject matter the actors both major and minor make you feel like you are rafting down that river right along with them the thing that separates this film from others is the tangible sense of dread that it inspires not many films can make you feel this creeped out bottom line this movie is a classic i can t really say much more than that
first off let me say i have wanted to see this movie for about a year now because i knew angelina jolie was in it and i love her but my love for her has nothing to do with my opinion of the movie anyhow no video stores carried it but low and behold the local library did i watched it and absolutely loved it yes there were italian stereotypes but it was done well and funny it was not degrading in any way every actor and actress did a superb job i laughed very hard at the sexual humor overall i think this movie is well worth seeing if you can find it it is adorable and just plain fun to watch i rarely rank movies as a but i give this one a go find it and watch it
this film is fantastic finally well written characters you can love for all their good and bad pierce brosnan is flat out hysterical in this self effacing role i think its the best thing he s ever done he s done other roles that exhibited shades of being capable of this kind of fully fledged work but this role finally gave him the room to run with it i almost died when he walked across the hotel lobby in his underwear and boots and greg kinnear and hope davis are a couple to aspire too as well as actors to aspire too kinnear is so goofy likable that his turn in the end is truly gratifying you give good actors good work to play with and they give us something more back
one of the best if not the best stephen king s screenings dark as dark can be surprising non hollywood ending terrifying atmosphere amazing book adaptation outstanding cast educational don t play with afterlife in short everything an excellent horror should be my favorite horror movie straight
enjoyed viewing this film on tcm and watching a very young william powell philo vance playing detective just like he did with myrna loy in the thin man series back in the s william powell played in the philo vance series and in this picture the famous veteran actress mary astor hilda lake becomes one of the suspects in a murder suicide case where a man named archer coe robert barrot is found dead and archer was in a room that was bolted from the inside ralph morgan raymond wrede archer s secretary gave a great supporting role and was the brother to frank morgan who appeared in the wizard of oz eugene palette detective sgt heath appeared in quite a few of these philo vance films and also gave a great performance in robin hood with errol flynn always remember the least likely actor could very well be the killer enjoy a great classic from the past
for those who think of dame may witty as the kindly slightly batty old lady from hitchcock s the lady vanishes this movie requires an adjustment here she s anything but kindly or batty instead her son george macready is the loony one just don t give him a knife otherwise his eyes light up and no furniture cushion in the house is safe now we know what he has in mind for the trapped nina foch if he can just get out from under mother s domineering hand really tight little woman in danger film that keeps the suspense on high throughout the script never strays from foch s dilemma she s held prisoner in a big old gothic house on the edge of an angry sea they re going to kill her but why her predicament makes no sense the tension mounts as she tries one escape ploy after another but even strangers seem against her we begin to feel her helplessness and mounting paranoia as the world turns away from her director joseph h lewis took a big step toward cult status with this film and understandably so then too watch foch run subtly through a gamut of emotions without once going over the top witty too shines as a really intimidating matriarch who knows what she wants and how to get it if she can just keep her wacko son in line my one reservation is the climax which seems too contrived considering the timing of the events nonetheless it s a good nerve wracking way to spend a little over an hour courtesy columbia studios
i love this movie it was one of my favorite movies the action never stops the whole movie was done very well the ending is really good ontop of it being action filled they even have a surprised put in there for you when i saw what the movie was about on the internet i was kind of not sure if i wanted to see this movie but sense i am such a big luke perry fan i decided to give it a chance i am glad that i did give it a chance because this was a very well though out movie it was very original whoever thought up this movie gets a standing ovation from me the acting was great luke perry did an excellent job once again i give this movie the highest rating
superman and the mole men is quite possibly superman s toughest adventures ever lois lane and clark kent are sent to silsby home of the world s deepest oil well while there some radioactive mole men come up through the oil well and explore the town jeff corey and many other townspeople try to dispose of the invading mole men can superman change the people s ways in time to save the mole men can superman warn the people in time about the radioactive danger the mole men bring in my opinion superman and the mole men is a very intelligent well written and well acted movie even though we only get to see superman fly once briefly it still makes a great superman adventure a must see for anyone stars
chalk this one up in the win column this was a superb movie the acting performances were great and the script was equally great helen hunt was magnificent as the riverside police officer gina pulasky gina was a complex character she was a rookie cop with the riverside police dept she ended up in an affair with a coworker that she knew had a wife and kids all the while she took on the dangerous task of going undercover to catch a serial killer jeff fahey the ray liotta look alike did a bang up job as the confused often stammering police officer that had an affair with gina he was stoic as an officer but he was quite the opposite when it came to dealing with his feelings and his extra marital affair steven weber most notably from the sitcom wings did a nice job as the quiet meek underachieving sociopath on the surface he was an innocent loser but beneath the surface lied a cold hearted killer weber really took on the persona of a childlike young adult with an insatiable thirst to kill young boys the entire movie was spectacular each scene each verbal exchange let us know more and more about the characters the production team did a phenomenal job with condensing days if not weeks worth of events into a minute movie this movie was a good example of doing a lot with little
i know the film snobs are snorting but if you re looking for a surprisingly fun ride through the b movie jungle try jake speed a little thin at times but its one liners and the location more then make up for this john hurt god love him seems to be having fun doing his role as the ultra evil white slaver the nemesis of crawfords jake speed he adds a dimension to the film that only a pro like hurt could provide crawford and dennis christopher jakes sidekick are a good team although you do wonder why they both put up with each other however together both crawford and christopher portray a team that is just so much fun that if you can get over yourself for a moment you may find yourself acting like a kid again at the situations and the inherent suspense they provide the delicious karen kopins does a great job as the damsel in distress that is more concerned about the motives of her rescuer then her tormentor i have yet to find a movie that is as much fun without getting preachy or bogging down the movie by trying too hard not every movie has to be the latest citizen kane and trust me wells was an original so lets remember that sometimes movies are for fun not social commentary or attempting to sway an audience politically but just for the sheer fun of being alive and living in a time when our hero s live in a celluloid dimension
what a delightful film accompanied by oscar winning composer rachel portman s lush emotional and dreamy music this film remains a pure delight worthy of viewing more than once a year incredible casting gwyneth paltrow was perfect for the role of emma toni collette was great as harriett smith the character who stole the film was miss bates she was mesmerizing to watch one finds oneself on the edge of ones seat just hanging on her every word and laughing hysterically with her one of the most endearing characters i have come across in ages from one of the opening scenes when she is thanking mr woodhouse for sending that lovely quarter hind of pork pork mother she shouts into her daffy and clearly hearing impaired mother mrs bates played by emma thompson s mother phyllida law who looks forlorn and lost the comical ways that emma would avoid the grating miss bates builds itself up for one truly gut wrenching scene at the picnic when emma insults miss bates who takes her cruel dig to her heart we then see poor miss bates stammering and on the verge of tears and just so crushed one can not help but feel one s heart ripped out to her on her behalf it is a classic scene one to be rewound and played over over the ending is right up there with sense sensibility and provides one of life s greatest lessons about how one should marry one s best friend i hope that this film delights you all as much as it has myself i adored it
i really like this show i can readily see how it achieved cult status it s original and thought provoking for some reason though i have never felt the kind of resonance from it that i could have it doesn t pack the kind of open door winter chill that was to be had from such an awesome premise each time i watch an episode i find myself prodding and pushing for it to answer some nameless formless question before continuing let me preface this by saying that what follows is my opinion and my opinion only different strokes for different folks i would have liked to have seen more scenes in american gothic that were shot at night there s too much daylight in this show and i think it had a tendency to counteract the suspense we re not afraid of the daylight after all we re concerned about what s in the shadows the devil isn t always in the details what we re not seeing is often the most frightening second and this is the one that s probably going to lead to tar and feathers gary cole is a tremendously talented actor a character actor i ve followed his career from the brady bunch films on which is why it pains me to say that he was probably miscast as lucas buck he s almost too petroichan too likable to be embodiment of evil even by biblical standards lucas buck is a narcotic he s heroin he s freebasing in a kitchen laboratory next to a gallon of drain o you keep going back even though you know the end will be madness and death he should be like the ultimate loan shark he s a maker of book but also of unspeakable condemnation sure you ve got the money and before long you re also going to have broken fingers a severed hand a decapitated head and eventually a damned soul turning to buck is an act of desperation and whenever he s around there should be some immediate ambient finality with interest compounded daily in the air it s all largess all strings attached and by the time you realize that you ll also know that it s too late which leads me to three they showed buck a little too often he s in most of the scenes in fact which may have caused him to lose his edge the sheriff would be like the next door mythology he s the apocryphal acquaintance many would know of him but only an unfortunate few would really know him he d be the stuff of flashbacks and cryptic conversations and the perfect person to deliver this plot exposition would have been the deputy character that nick searcy portrayed four the show could be very self reverential to a fault some might say and this is typified by the whistling of meet me at the fishing hole in the series pilot i think we ve already established that what cassidy and raimi were shooting for was the anti andy taylor we probably didn t need the concept delivered to us via fed ex i gathered that within the first five minutes so for me the piano on the head was unnecessary these remarks are all about what for me would have made a good show great i also understand that the producers had their own unique style and that there were many hands in the soup in their everlasting quest for lcd programming the network played a definite role in the demise of this series the least these jerk off suits could have done was to air the episodes in order get real either way it s a grievous loss to both genre fans and casual viewers alike
i saw this film back at the palm springs international film festival and of the films i saw there i would rank this as my film i had an initial interest in seeing this being of swedish descent myself with many of my ancestors coming from the norrland region of sweden where this was filmed also i grew up in an area of rural north woods america where many small towns were much like the setting of this film it s nice to see more films using rural locations as their settings like s som i himmelen this was a very good film and i m sure a very hard film to pull together with it s large ensemble cast but director kay pollock really pulled this off after a nearly two decade absence from directing helen sjoholm in her motion picture debut as an actress was fantastic and i would look forward to more of her on the big screen i enjoyed michael nyqvist in the lead of this well rounded cast i would highly recommend this film and rate it a on a scale of
this first two seasons of this comedy series were very strange and they weren t very funny and had a drama element where bill the mother was struggling with all the usual problems in life but that element was a bit depressing and didn t mix well with th comedy elements which is probably why it was dropped after that it soon became one of the funniest comedy series the bbc have ever made the chemistry between bill and ben s character s were very funny and there was always so many brilliant and memorable sketches in each series the christmas specials were hilarious and a real treat for christmas the show came to a stop when the main actor gary olsen playing bill passed away which was very sad because he was a brilliant actor in films such as up n under and a very funny man ripthis underrated show has sadly disappeared from our television screens and doesn t to be repeated that often though it does appear on uktv gold once in a while but it should be repeated on bbc one or two to show this brilliant comedy to a new audience
before tuscan sky i saw diane lane s tender performance in this otherwise lark of a movie campers are invited to the camp of their youth and experience it as adults each of those that return seem to be looking for something they lost which makes it so realistic maybe you had to be a camper to really get it but in the words of one character noticing all her clothes were wet this is so camp from the practical jokes and fighting over boyfriends to the scary lunch lady and the early morning bell it s amp once exciting activities now seem mundane a terrific ensemble cast makes the best of one two dimensional roles and makes them believable bill paxton diane elizabeth mrs brad paisley probably when he first fell for her the beautiful scenery bright colors comical music including variations of hello muddah and a comic acting turn by noted director sam raimi makes this a movie you can pull out again and again like looking up an old friend
one used to say concerning nathaniel hawthorne that his failures were more interesting than his successes i believe that the same remark could suit to mcdonald eddy s pictures and especially this one it apparently possesses many characteristics of a failed movie it s kitsch the script because of censorship sounds inconsistent yet this movie gets also some good points good rodgers hart s music i married an angel tira tira tira la good acting with e e horton and reginald owen anyway if you may dislike it you can t forget it this strange movie actually leaves a very strong dreamlike impression and you are very likely to keep it in mind for days maybe for weeks why in the thirties and the beginning of the forties movies didn t have the same mean than today it aimed like a dream to divert the public in order to make it forget a difficult reality of all the the dream movies that was made in that time this one stands as particularly powerful in short let s say that the better way to appreciate this movie is to watch it without wondering whether it s good or bad to watch it like you would watch a dream
there has never been anything like it that s for sure this episodic seemingly redundant trilogy only really makes sense taken as a whole and as such it is not a movie about groovin gary utah cross dressing sensation it is very self consciously a film about how the filmmaker reacts to groovin gary for harris the entire project is clearly an extended and spectacular contortion of guilt and repentance he s trying to atone for his sins yes gary did attempt suicide after the initial doc was aired through correction commentary and convention reclaiming such hollywood narrative standbys as the best friend and the defiant happy ending two different ones with a telling adjustment in the glover version and turning them to his own very personal uses so while thematically it remains a movie about gender and difference the structure ensures that it is also a movie about movies but on an almost unprecedented level of complexity there is just so much going on in telling and re telling this story harris is in the right place at the right time three times in a row and he doesn t miss the opportunity to make something of it immensely moving and as profound as camp ever gets
cusack does his best david niven in this one although i don t know if anyone besides me noticed it when seen with this in mind its a deliciously over saturated wants to be taken more seriously than austin powers but still be pretty d mn funny reworking of an under appreciated comedy classic hillary duff does an over sexualized britney spears lap dance version of mata bond the writers built a little reverse oedipus twist into the plot interesting choice i never knew how soothing montel s voice was until this movie i think he has found a new calling doing nav system voice overs
i found this to be the most enjoyable muppets movie because i felt it was the most light hearted and had the best comic delivery on most of its lines the muppets try to go on broadway to sell an original musical they ve written but along the way they run into the usual problems including kermit s memory loss here while there aren t as many great cameos here as in the original muppets movie there are some including joan rivers and dabney coleman simply the timing and delivery of so many of the lines is great and the situations the muppets find themselves in are hilarious the original songs are also good here and the ending is satisfying there is not much else to say about the film but muppet fans should see it for sure it is the funniest muppet movie and is sure to be enjoyed by all out of
did you know that anthony kiedis singer from the red hot chili peppers father is in this movie blackie dammit is anthony s father i noticed this after reading scar tissue anthony s autobiography and saw a picture of his father i thought well that guy kinda looks like that guy from that movie i saw in the eighties then i read more and it said his father was an actor that had a few small roles after checking this site and comparing with a search on the net i realized it really is his father in the movie it s funny because nowhere in the book does it mention him being in this movie perhaps his son was ashamed of his father s acting job in this flick but he need not be i think his father blackie did a great job in the show
a great film slow yes but original deeply atmospheric dark and horrifying perfectly surreal feels like a nightmare i d compare it to david lynch eraserhead inland empire blue velvet style maybe with mixed with a little bit of barton fink and naked lunch insects also a bit of jodorowsky fando y lis add some night on earth angel heart and a bit of begotten pi would it be wrong to mention tetsuo jacob s ladder barker s the forbidden and salome that should form together at least the concept of a dark night nuit noire if you re out for avantegardistic and or surrealistic cinema like i am you re gonna like this one if you re expecting anything else like a movie full of action with some average plot try your luck with something else final words the plot is very very strange and unusual and that s probably the reason why most people who don t appreciate this film hate it
this was a well written tale of the making of the batman sitcom and actually reunites our heroes on a great quest as well as offers their tv shows history unlike the brady s and partridge family documentary movies we not only get a look into the past and present lives of adam and burt but also get to see them back in action filled with kapow s and catwomen and the riddler s batman is back ina well told tale that not only gives us a satisfactory closing to the batman series but fills the modern fan in on all the hollywood tales that about them that haven t been heard in years kudos
as a lover of bad movies i definitely hit paydirt with this one the plot isn t really that bad but there are a few instances where you really have to ask yourself what the heck is going on here there are many many things that make this the funniest bad movie ever first off rudy ray moore had gotten so fat and slow when this movie was filmed that the special effects consist of speeding up the fight scenes to double time there are also scenes where there is a slow motion instant replay jumping onto a ten foot high wall by playing falling off of it backwards naked men walking out of huge letters and sex that literally brings down the roof with the cable holding up the roof catching on fire of course no rudy ray moore movie would be complete without a completely gratuitous and random comedy club scene where rudy makes fun of all the customers interposed with people doing some odd dance there are so many things bad about this movie but they re bad in an entertaining way and if you take your eyes off the movie you might miss another mistake rating for actual value for cheese factor for picking out mistakes and goofs averages out to
make no mistake maureen o sullivan is easily the most gorgeous jane ever and there will never be one more gorgeous she is visually stunning that aside it takes more than a beautiful woman to make a good film this is a great film it not only has the classic tarzan aura but also the feel of the continuing saga we become involved with the two white hunters who search for ivory one of them in love with jane the other a roguish catalyst whose character may be one of the best defined and best examined in movie history and these characterizations are what make this great action flick stand out as a classic there is the uncomfortable racism which is depicted however the africans are depicted as individuals and at the end two even become more heroic than the white hunters and stand out as such in fact the one not named evokes probably more sympathy from the audience than any other characters the finale also is one of the reasons to enjoy this movie the great lion attack has never been duplicated and the horror is well implied with character reactions more so than a modern gore movie would do with graphic depiction if i left anything out it is because i do not want to soil the picture for those who haven t seen it but it is everything you could want in a movie
level one horror when i saw this film for the first time at i knew it would give me nightmares it did surprisingly as i recall it was the sound as much as the sight of the monster that caused them level two psychoanalytic theory later as an adult i saw the story for what it was what if the savage unrestrained instincts we all repress became manifest level three pure science fiction the best way plausibly to realize the plot s what if is through the science fiction genre this is pure science fiction not the cowboys in space that passes for the genre today after years forbidden planet remains the greatest of all science fiction films if planning a remake skg or lucas watch out
the autobiography on which this movie is based remains one of the most heart rending books i have ever read it tells the amazing stories of two sisters both who earned devotion and respect working well into their s as a teacher and a dentist then lived another years with dignity ruby dee steals the film with her perfectly nuanced performance as the rebellious blacker bessie the dentist she not only expresses her anger angst and wisdom well she lets you know exactly where they ve come from using an economy of words diahnn carroll has the feel of the older sister the teacher down perfectly but i m afraid she never makes me believe that she s over no matter the stories are well worth telling amy madigan is a bit too extreme and intrusive in acting overwhelmed and insecure in the first half of the movie as the caucasian ny times reporter this too is only a minor distraction the stories all true are the attraction and although two or three get slightly damaged in the translation most of them make it through just fine i recommend the book as essential reading to all people i recommend any books to i cannot quite but this tv movie in that rarefied air but it certainly captures enough of the flavor to be highly worthwhile in its own right
i loved this movie it is rare to get a glimpse of post partum vietnam and this movie sans combat scenes and exciting bombs and gunfire did it i had no idea i d be so affected by it what an amazing look at how alien vets feel it was tough to watch quite frankly we all understand the fighting and the apocalypse now type of drama but this is so so different what happens when they come back and try to live a life they can t it made me very aware of a large group of men that are rattling around lost in america not able to relate can t sleep can t have love affairs can t deal with normal society they feel totally apart this is a huge tragedy and one that isn t addressed enough yeah we ve changed our attitude about vietnam vets we like them now but so what it doesn t seem to have made any difference to them it s too late so it was a great film but i cried a lot i have no other criticisms
yeah this films is tops cant recommend it more gay or strait its a great doco for anyone who likes film very funny sad and interesting never dull great access a film made with passion and interest in the subject matter some of the performances and just amazing if you only find this film on vhs it is still very worth watching great out of i got to see part of this doco years about ten years ago and did not understand what i was watching the interviews are very revealing about egos of the performers who are like heavy weight boxers trying to punch their way out of the ghetto the filmmaker was apparently a first timer so what an achievement cool track it down
down to earth is the best movie it is so funny and it s really sweet too it has a good plot and it s unique it isn t like those movies that are all the same with the similar story lines and it s not all comedy and no story this movie also has a very good ending
the invisible mouse is a delightful and different tom jerry s cartoon it features the usual cat mouse chases and battles but in a different way this time jerry accidentally falls in a bottle of invisible ink and is obviously very glad about this because he realizes that he can prepare lots of surprises for tom scare him torment him and confuse him as much as it is weird it s also very cool and funny to see what we can t see jerry invisible it s amusing to see things lifting up in the air without seeing who s doing it we know who right it s like those things had a life of their own or even almost like a matter of ghosts it s equally amusing to see jerry eating some candies and fruits while he s invisible i really like that instrumental music which plays when he s not visible some of the best jokes on this short are when tom sees jerry s shadow and slams him and even when tom tries to slam him with a frying pan and jerry writes missed me i also like when jerry drinks tom s chocolate milk becoming visible again and with a happy look on his face overall this short has the basic ingredients needed for a classic cartoon humor entertainment fun and some nice artwork too
what can you say when you see a good french movie which tries to draw a suspenseful story in line with the social background of the characters the major point is we believe in those characters and once they ve met each other we want them to stay together it s simple and really efficient the background story is less important why does the screenplay go on the side of a half developed thriller it helps not to get stuck in those social demonstrations most french film jerkers like to make not too much ambition right sur mes l vres is only an entertaining french film with good characterization for all the clever noir points in the screenplay the end is by far too easy it goes quite as easy as in rear window an obvious reference and definitely not a noir film but with a less compelling context where i am amazed it s to see that the character of the probation officer has not been erased he brings very little to the story when he appears alone we wonder if we ve not missed a part before jacques audiard is not a new comer yet strange and weird
this was a delightful presentation hemo blood as a greek god was so well played by the animation with vanity arrogance snobbish superiority and innocent wonder the quote or scene i recall vividly is when hemo tires of all this plumbing you haven t learned my secrets at all and threatens to storm out the scientist answers him in a single word thalassa salt water which horrifies the fiction writer but mollifies hemo and segues so neatly into the chemical aspects of blood such a splendid blend of entertainment and information make this a classic as fresh and engrossing today as the day it was released stimulating the interest and imagination is fundamental to teaching kids to love learning

steven speilberg s adaptation of alice walkers popular novel is not without its share of controversy when first released members of the black community criticised its treatment of black men while others questioned why a white man was directing this film about black women this is the story of a young black woman named celie growing up in rural america after the turn of the century she has two children by her abusive father which are snatched from her arms at birth her only solace in her miserable life comes from her sister celie played in later years by newcomer whoopie goldberg is married off to an abusive husband danny glover the husband is humiliated by the sister and so she is quickly removed from celie s life the story is often heartbreaking as celie keeps up hope that she may one day be reunited with her sister and with her children throughout her life she meets an assortment of characters including sophia a tough as nails wife to her step son and shug a loud and luscious saloon singer who teaches her a thing or two about love speilberg s direction is all over this picture which offers brilliant cinematography and some stellar performances i dare you to watch this film and not be moved the film the color purple manages to capture the essence of what is a complicated story while it tends to minimise the lesbian aspects as well as the african story both of which were so vivid in the book the movie remains true to its themes allowing the voice of alice walker to shine through i couldn t begin to respond to the controversy that surrounded this film suffice it to say however this is one of the few films that i can watch again and again and which has left an indelible mark on me
i have to say that this was not very exciting but talk about fashion and weird ways to solve a mystery a little too simple nancy drew emma roberts uses imdb that s fantastic i really liked about that part of the movie corky josh flitter is however extremely hilarious and ned nickerson max thieriot seemed really hopeless he should have been more angry with her for how she has treated him alright this movie is tour and fashion in disguise anyhow i recommend this movie just for summer fun encore nancy just for fun more teen spy movies by emma roberts spymate remember she s becoming good at this tricky detective work
this is one of the best comedy ever the writing of this parody of soap is brilliant and the cast well just look at the names of the cast and you ll understand why it is so great if you re a kevin kline fan he does as always an fantastic performance and robert downey jr is perfect if you don t laugh while seen this movie you don t have any sense of humor
this horror movie based on the novel of the same name suffers from flawed production and choppy amateurish direction but it s nonetheless strangely compelling unlike shocker horror flicks such as the exorcist this movie takes the viewer on a slow yet relentless dip into a pool of evil it drifts into horror which dawns on the audience with the same dreamlike slowness as it dawns on the poor girl who s been unwittingly chosen to be the next sentinel her appointed task is to sit at the gates of hell and prevent evil from erupting into the world this falls on her in atonement for her attempted suicide earlier in her life the story is true to the book which was riveting but the way it s edited can lose the viewer there are subtleties in the plot that are shaved away and never explained satisfactorily which hurts this film that s a pity the sentinel is not an edge of your seat kind of flick it s more a watch and squirm uncomfortably like a bad car wreck there s a compulsion to look even when it becomes unbearable this movie isn t all bad and still has a capacity to shock the cast was competent christina raines was captivating as alison the vulnerable girl under spiritual attack from both sides a pawn in the never ending battle between good and evil chris sarandon was good as her caring but ultimately self centered boyfriend eli wallach and a very young christopher walken are the detectives struggling to unravel the bizarre puzzle they ve been handed ava gardner is elegant as the realtor unaware of the horrors lurking in her rental property the gaunt elderly john carradine with his arthritis twisted hands is excellent as the dying sentinel who must be replaced the devil is played to charming perfection by burgess meredith he s so sweet and yet so evil there are future stars hidden in this film beverly d angelo and jeff goldblum as friends of the poor girl and jerry orbach playing successfully against type as a jerky television director the damned souls at the end are portrayed by actual sideshow freaks and geeks whoever thought to do that was a twisted but brilliant genius the horror that pervades the movie bubbles up unexpectedly such as when alison opens a door and finds something that evokes a flashback to when she found her father with his two whores she relives her first suicide attempt faces a pair of strangely dysfunctional lesbians and sees a cat cut up as a cake time and again she s yanked back and forth through reality and fantasy through dreams and waking nightmares all the while lacking the means to cope in truth the devil is trying to drive her insane enough to kill herself before becoming the next sentinel will he succeed in summary slow moving yet indescribably creepy well acted but poorly directed and a very typical s horror film before the real shockers cut loose no pun intended this movie may not work for those with a short attention span but it can still send chills up the spine and still can provide some low key shock value it remains a strangely compelling and entertaining dip into the realm of evil
elvira mistress of the dark is a sort of harper valley p t a with touches of the supernatural elvira cassandra peterson walks off her job as television horror movie hostess after the new station s owner gets fresh with her she s now relying on a las vegas show to carry her through but learns she needs to come up with more money to get the show started things look hopeless to raise that money until she receives notice of her aunt s death which then takes elvira to massachusetts for the reading of the will a house in need of repairs a dog and a cookbook are all that is left to her by her aunt and again it seems elvira is having trouble coming up with the money for the las vegas show the adults of the small and narrow minded town make things worse by making things more difficult for elvira only the local hunk daniel greene and a group of teenagers will befriend her elvira s uncle vinnie w morgan sheppard presses to make a deal with elvira for the cookbook but elvira soon learns of her powerful heritage that includes spellcasting and a couple very effective casseroles elvira no longer wants to sell the cookbook to her uncle but he is determined to get his hands on it knowing of its power elvira then faces being burned at the stake on the town s old charge of witchcraft and the showdown between her and her uncle the plot is pretty simple but the humor and well developed characters keep it moving at a nice pace elvira mistress of the dark is full of cute gross bawdy and clever humor carried through by the many sight gags puns props songs and parodies the film s touches of the occult make this one of the best horror parodies ever made it is a well made film with terrific acting by all performers including edie mcclurg and jeff conaway of grease there are also nice special effects many people including myself wondered if the elvira character could carry a feature film and the answer is delightfully yes
this movie is great it touched my stone cold heart i couldn t relate about the racial discrimination that antwone has experienced because i m living in my own country i guess it is really hard to be discriminated we watched this film in our sociology class in new era university and i didn t knew that it was a true story i thought it was just created by an intellectual who want to bring a fresh air in the industry it is very good the part that shocked me was when nadine abused antwone who was just six sexually if i were on his shoes i could have jumped a ten story high building i salute him for he being so strong the scene that touched me here is when antwone finally saw his mother eva face to face he did not bitched her or whatever instead he told her about the achievements that he got within the long years that they have been separated i think i ll do that when i get the chance of tracing my roots
this is a wonderfully written and well acted psychological drama it is not really a horror flick so those looking for something like the ring or the grudge will be disappointed what really surprised me about this film was the intelligence and subtle attention to detail in the plot and the effort made to be internally consistent i also appreciated the absence of dr phil psychobabble or new age revisionism rather than advancing an agenda the filmmakers just told the story told it well and let the viewer think about it the sparse dreamscapes were reminiscent of wyeth paintings and amazingly effective a great example of how to make a good film on a small budget without big studios star actors big name directors this was far better than many of hitchcock s films special effects or clever plot twists
i first saw this movie at the sundance film festival this year and being a teenager myself i found the movie to be quite appealing these kids are out of the ordinary and very unexpected to be in a movie of this stature but with the right dialog and junk they made the movie a complete success i enjoyed this movie more then others but i highly recommend releasing and watching this movie it is a mixture of witty comments and hilarious reality capturing the essence of high school high school record has topped my favorites list and hopefully has a chance to be released into theaters i truly thank all of the kids who put the hard work into making this film it helped me cry my eyes our in laughter
i saw this movie as a teenager and immediately identified with reese witherspoon s portrayal of dani trant a year old tomboy in rural louisiana circa she feels that she will never be as beautiful as her older sister maureen a now rarely seen emily warfield and feeling out of place in terms of her conservative baptist upbringing then seventeen year old court foster jason london the son of her mother s close friend gail strickland moves in next door dani experiences her first crush while court enjoys her company and willful spirit dani succeeds in getting her first kiss from him but as soon as he sees maureen he falls head over heels for her leaving dani behind the sisters close bond is fractured severely by the rivalry that erupts which only deepens when court dies in a tragic accident the girls then are made to realize how much they need each other sam waterson and tess harper are just perfect as the loving parents trying to balance their daughters individuality at the same time trying to keep the family together the beautiful cinematography and the wonderful soundtrack featuring elvis presley the platters and many more contribute wonderfully to the film s atmosphere of a simpler time a touching coming of age film with a timeless message
remember the early days of pay per view i do and i can almost remember the number you had to call to actually rent the movie on your t v as a kid we always wanted to rent playboy but this meant actually calling someone from ppv and asking to rent it and then you get the nerve to do it and your watching four hours of soft core no angle crap well the reason i bring that up is because this movie too was on ppv and i remember almost every scene that was in the add i ve been on a kick in the last few years to obtain all the great movies i use to see as a kid and this was one of them it s one that when its on its hard to shut off all star cast trying to commit the perfect bank bust but nothing goes right there are plenty of spoof bank capers that are good and this one has to fall in that category it has enough action and laughs to sustain it check it out if you dare
i saw this film at the rhode island international film festival and was completely blown away the structure and execution of the film was fantastic i know it won t but it really deserves an oscar nod cal and andre were phenomenal as the two disturbed classmates yes the film is very controversial and i can see a lot of people having a lot of problems with it as it deals with school shooting and especially makes you identify with the killers however despite its harsh and blunt subject matter zero day is so worth watching i m looking forward to it coming out on video so i can buy it it s very very good very powerful and intense the end shooting sequence leaves you speechless because it s almost too realistic their uncertainty the recordings the footage and panic of the students totally indescribable i really hope it gets the attention it deserves it s done in the same format as the blair witch project handheld camera made to appear as a true home video documentary kind of film but god is it infinitely better very impressive hats off to everyone involved if you ve got the chance you really should see it
police story is one of jackie chan s classic films that helped shape the hong kong cinema it is a masterpiece that should not be missed by any action movie fan from the beginning it is obvious that jackie chan s stunt team literally risked their live to make this film both the action and the stunts are extremely realistic and innovative even today no movie has outdone police story in dangerous stunts many people were hospitalized in police story including jackie chan the fighting is not as indisputably exceptional as the stunts but the fighting in this movie helped change and define jackie chan s use of props throughout the film chan uses odd object to stop attackers and is constantly throwing assailants through thick glass the action feels real because the stuntmen are giving the movie all they have to give and jackie chan s coordination is outstanding the rest of the aspects of the film are not without flaws but they will not disappoint any action fan chan not only plays a believable risk taking cop but shows the powerful changes that his character goes through as he falls into escalating desperation the plot is powerful but a modern viewer may find it tedious at times while the comedy will provide a good number of laughs it does not always distract the audience from the lack of action however for the time period it was made in the driving aspects of the plot are entertaining there a good number of interesting and well played characters dispersed throughout the film as well overall police story is without a doubt one of the best action movies ever made and even in hollywood the influences of this one film are not to be ignored
this is an awesome classic monster flick from the s i just love the look of the s in general like the cars and the music anyway i love the way the blob looks i love when the everyone is at the late night horror flick at the theater and the blob comes in and crashes the party another thing i love about it is that it takes place all in one night just like halloween ii when steve and jane are making out they see a meteor fall from space inside the meteor is the blob whenever the blob consumes a person it grows bigger and bigger they try to convince the people of the town about the blobby monster but no one believes them until later can anything stop this blobby creature i highly recommend the blob
i didn t want this to get complicated leese i have to assume she s gonna read that fear takes flight at feet in this taut action thriller an overnight flight to miami quickly becomes a battle for survival when lisa rachel mcadams realizes her seatmate cillian murphy is planning to use her as part of a chilling assassination plot as the minutes tick by she s in a race against time to warn the potential victims before its to late one of the many reasons i love this movie is because of the chemistry between the two stars mcadams and murphy who are also two of my top favorite actors for example the early scenes at the airport play more like a romantic comedy two people keep running into each other i got to hand it to the two as well for making a film like this work especially murphy s character jackson who really seems to be sort of complicated in that way that he acts charming and innocent yet he s trying to do his job and make lisa feel trapped physically and mentally i mean in certain parts he really seems to be concerned for lisa a great thrill ride all the way through a lot of films i would hate to see a prequel or a sequel about but actually i wouldn t mind a prequel to this one which would take place with jackson surveilling lisa favorite scene is probably that headbutt scene because it was so unexpected there was also that nice buildup to the famous pen scene when is she going to make her move there was also that nice change in mcadam s lisa where she changed herself from being a victim into fighting back i also loved the scene where she sits down in the food court and pretends to ask some ladies a survey about the food court how great was murphy with his whole weezing
paris is the place to be to enjoy beautiful art and music and to fall madly in love as is the case in this film boy meets girl they fall in love but something stands in their way of eternal happiness the classic story the wonderful music of george gerschwin complements the great dancing by gene kelly and leslie caron an american in paris is a humorous light hearted loving film well worth watching
this is the best version so far that you will see and the most true to the bronte work dalton is a little tough to imagine as rochester who jane eyre declared not handsome but his acting overcomes this and zelah clark pretty as she is is also a complete and believable jane eyre this production is a lengthy watch but well worth it nearly direct quotes from the book are in the script and if you want the very first true romance in literature this is the way to see it i own every copy of this movie and have read and re read the original the filming may seem a little dated now but there will never be another like this
watching this several times as a child was quite the experience years ago and now that i ve found it again it still has a film experience like few others if risky it s a great display of morals and life lessons recommended for family viewing with young kids while it still holds up as an adult i was fortunate to have learned from it many times over years ago trying to find it today is hard enough but believe me it is well worth it no matter what the age anime fans especially will find this a great entry to masami hata s filmography with impressive art work and unique designs chirin no suzu represents a worthwhile experience while some of the lyrical songs are not so hot when recorded in english the musical score is nevertheless captivating but even the voice acting is far better than much released today unfortunately is went out of print in the mid s from rca columbia home video and has not received any new format release to my knowledge at least in the us look hard for it and you will be quite satisfied it s an artful intense enjoyable and important landmark in japanese animation
this was a favorite of my childhood i can remember seeing it on television and thrilling to it each time now that i m grown up and have a kid of my own i wanted to introduce him to this classic movie we watched it last friday and he liked it during abu s fight with the giant spider my son s hand crept over and took hold of mine he was genuinely scared is he gonna beat the spider poppa just watch you ll see he has no historical frame of reference to speak of eight years old so bagdad under the grandson of haroun al raschid might as well be oz under ozma i think he especially liked how much of the heroics and derring do were perpetrated by the boy thief and not the grown up king in fact if you deconstruct the film s narrative a bit the king is the thief s sidekick not the hero at all which must be very satisfying to imaginative adventurous young boys it s definitely a period piece i suspect that by the time he s eleven or twelve my son will find it corny or whatever word the next generation will be using by then the love story is barely one dimensional as a cynical friend commented why does ahmad love the princess because the narrative demands it the willingness of abu to put himself in jeopardy repeatedly for the clueless love struck deposed king is equally improbable but to quibble about such things while accepting flying mechanical horses fifty foot genies and the temple of the all seeing eye would be fatuous in the extreme the satisfaction of seeing the prophecy fulfilled at the movie s climax is tremendous as is the final shot of abu triumphantly flying away on his stolen magic carpet seeking some fun and adventure at last
now this is what i m talking about finally a low budget horror outing that uses its limitations to its advantage wendigo while occasionally flawed is a triumph of the imagination granted it leans heavy on evil dead style camera moves for its moodiness but it s still a damn sight better than of direct to video dross the story is pretty simple a family takes a vacation at a remote cabin and are menaced by one particularly unhinged hunter but director larry fessenden really knows how to build suspense and add layers of unsettling creepiness through the use of the mythical wendigo is it real is it all in the boy s imagination is it an externalization of the child s emotional state some have quibbled that the film is unsatisfying because it s left to you to decide don t be put off by such petty nonsense a film that makes you think is not one to avoid it s one to rejoice in
a realistic depiction of young love for the college set but also appealing to an older viewer like me it has ups and downs and twists and turns and made me shed a tear or two we rarely see movies with black urban characters that could appeal to older non black audiences and show a more real life depiction of young black adults this movie takes place on a college campus and town where two people meet and fall in love in the background are various friends acquaintances and situations that impact them for better or worse typical plot some may say but this really was unexpected i found myself rooting for the survival of the couple s relationship seeing my own past in their story moments of deep thought and revelation came pouring out of the actors performances it s a bright film that i would endorse for those young at heart and in love or have ever been in love great movie i ll be looking for a copy to add to my movie collection
i must say i thought i had seen it all i am an extremely jaded movie buff this movie didn t shock me by any means i m way past that point but it did take me to certain emotional places i didn t know i could go to i had no idea i could ever find ick the idea of beastiality erotic never never never ever ever but there you go he did it i have to give the director credit he pulled it off for the first minutes this movie is a total bore we start off with some very explicit footage of two horses having sex after five minutes of this i started wondering if buying this movie wasn t a mistake then an old guy in a wheelchair talks to some other old guy about two people getting married then some nervous guy shaves then we see briefly a hot chick getting it on with a butler but this is very brief at this point i was cursing the movie out loud while trying to stay awake in fact i fell asleep at about the minute mark and forced myself to finish it the next night we finally get the good stuff when a girl who knows who she is or who anyone is in this movie has a dream about a victorian era gal being ravaged by a beast thing in the forest the scene goes on for quite some time and is really the meat heh heh of the whole deal it s beautifully shot superbly edited and does deliver the goods they do try to wrap up the plot at the end and it sort of makes sense but sort of doesn t either oh well i would definitely recommend this film the first minutes made me want to shoot myself and my tv but the last minutes totally redeems it
what can be said really the tenant is a first class thriller wrought with equal amounts of suspense and full blown paranoia it s an intricately plotted film every detail seems included for a reason even though the plot seldom makes sense and much of it is never even addressed in an objective manner therefore we are left with the increasingly unstable trelkovsky polanski a meek polish man who has obtained an apartment due to the previous tenant s suicide to guide us through a world of escalating fear and uncertainty after an apartment warming party thrown by a group of obnoxious coworkers trelkovsky comes under increased seemingly inexplicable scrutiny by the fellow occupants in his building the rest of the film chronicles his mental deterioration and gives us a thorough mindfu k on par with the later efforts of david lynch the tenant however is more brooding and sinister laced with unexpected comic relief fine performances and a truly haunting score it s a movie that s better experienced than described so hop to it
i really think that people are taking the wrong approach at this one first of all i find this short film very entertaining and interesting i just take it for what it is i think the suspense and mystery are ingenious in their insinuation upon the watcher one other thing that caught my fancy was that it immediately gets the viewer involved even though there is no clear story just hints and pauses and emotions played out by the characters that kind of give you the impression that there is a story to all that is going on no one else could have done that better than lynch this is the essence of lynchianism at its best sure i will agree with anyone that people that start viewing this with the desire to be entertained without any really imaginative work from the viewer s side will find themselves disappointed and in good right lynch is not about that at least this side of lynch is not the one that helped make lost highway mulholland dr is at full tilt here and people that just expect to be entertained like they would watching anything else will just not get what this is all about my opinion is that darkened room is all about messing with your animal core your instinctual self by giving you the means image sound situation by which you instinctively react it s not about pleasure of any kind it s about getting the desired reaction out of you and that my friend is pure art
haven t seen any of the japanese grudge films but i really enjoy this one i rarely get scared when watching films i can jump if the effect and sound is startling enough but getting scared from a movie is a rare thing for me but i did get scared from grudge maybe because i didn t expect anything at all when i watched it i didn t expect getting scared i didn t know anything about it either that was probably a good thing this is a film that you apparently either love or hate most people seem to compare it to the japanese grudge films but even though i haven t seen them i believe it isn t right to compare any film actually this film stands on it its own the story is weak most people say i don t agree the story is minimalistic and done so on purpose the story telling techniques used the broken time frame for instance is perfectly done the director knows exactly what he s doing and i believe he got his vision through as he wanted it i gave this film of it is a film you will enjoy watching or hate it s as simple as that
in my line of work i occasionally get contacted by independent filmmakers who are trying to publicize their film when i can i take a look at these low budget films and often they make me think that the future of hollywood is going to the dogs once in a while though there is a film that is born of pure passion and desire as if created for the purpose of reminding the film industry that good movies are still possible the short film b r o k e n directed by alex ferrari is a genuine surprise and worth a second look clocking in at a scant minutes b r o k e n tries to tell a compelling but surreal story with almost no back story the audience is plopped down in the middle of the action with no clue as to what is happening a young woman samantha jane polay awakens from a dream to hear a gunshot and is subsequently abducted from her home when she awakes she is surrounded by a group of mercenary thugs that look like they would be at home in a comic book these nasty guys and girls are larger than life they are all guns and knives there is no way out the kicker here is that despite being a low budget film it doesn t play like one from the very beginning the feeling is that b r o k e n has been shot edited and produced by professionals it looks like something quentin tarantino might have done on his day off when he was jamming with the wachowski brothers the film is sharp and cool it looks good and it feels like something big the acting is much better than i usually see in these smaller films polay and paul gordon who plays the head killer duncan were well chosen as two of the few speaking roles in the film it is up to them to carry the film no special effects no matter how good would have saved this film from bad acting thankfully polay manages to convey true fear and gordon manages to come off as a real psycho some of the more limited roles seem to be filled by lesser talent but it hardly shows the downside to b r o k e n is that it s only minutes long the story ends with a twilight zone twist that seems a bit contrived and is hardly subtle watching it i felt like i was supposed to have some epiphany but there was only a feeling that it was much more mundane than i had hoped it would be the film tries hard to be one of those puzzles that leaves audiences talking for hours at the local coffee shop but it comes off as unsatisfying i keep thinking that this is the first minutes of a longer film my rating out of
after some of the negative reviews i heard on this movie i was doubtful of giving it a go but i had in my wallet thought id gamble on buying a budget like movie saw this and gave it ago i m glad i did i enjoyed it directed by the star of films such as chain reaction the ring bourne identity brian cox i had to gamble with this even if it was rubbish but it weren t at all i found some of the humour quite funny especially alfred molina the star of spider man the character doc ock he was excellent the most enjoyable part of the film of course like many other people which bought this movie i saw matthew s name and that made me get it and no his part isn t big at all it s very short at the very end of the film it s not a big part which makes me believe thats why people hate the film i suggest you give it a go some parts are a pit poor that needed polishing the acting and a bit more action but it s watchable
i may be biased i am the author of the novel the hungry bachelors club self published in the screenplay was written by my good friend and hungry bachelor fred dresch who was the inspiration for the character marlon in the film i couldn t be more pleased with the trailer i hope to see the film in its entirety and i will further comment but jorja fox who plays delmar youngblood my character is stellar she carries the bulk of the emotional vehicles in fine form i couldn t have done better myself this looks like real people hardly formula driven and thankfully drives my statement against racial prejudice home gracefully and heartfelt
had never heard of the man in the moon until seeing it last evening on this hdtv channel look my taste is like any others eclectic my favorites run from blue velvet to dr strangelove to the ghost and mrs muir thru the wizard of oz and the loved one eraserhead repo man and the spy within the man in the moon is superbly made a gentle hearted joyous and tragic film beautifully filmed one in which the actors truly live in the moment rather than act this sweet tale shortly will be in our private library this beautiful story of life in a far finer era in rural louisiana literally transports you to its pastoral setting it s hard to remain stoic during the film s last moments particularly when the young girl the extent of her older sister s heart searing private pain and forgives all rather than spoil the enjoyment or bore you to sobs with my dull prose will end now with this suggestion from one who enjoys films which speak from the heart to ours if you purchase no other film please purchase the man in the moon this moving story is one you ll enjoy reliving time and again it is a joy and a gem a film all too scarce in this world of hardening hearts the simple virtues evinced in man in the moon are a joy to behold paul vincent zecchinomanasota key florida april
this is how i felt while watching this film i loved it it was hilarious but i did feel a like i was getting sneaky view into somebody s psyche and then laughing as it got twisted around to make an interesting point a friend put it this way i feel like we broke into somebody s house and are now watching their awful home videos without their knowledge another one of those fact is stranger than fiction pieces of film groovin gary the original beaver kid is a small town guy who turns up at a nearby tv station in the hope of getting on film and he certainly does though not perhaps as he initially expected with high hopes of fame and significance he invites harris to come and film a truly awful talent quest that he has organised in his home town headlined by his own drag act olivia newton don director trent harris does a brilliant job with this slowly evolving story some footage of an awkward kid who wants to be someone morphs over two subsequent reinterpretations into the story of freedom from repressed sexual identity in small town america harris simultaneously critiques the attitudes of small town america the cult of celebrity and the exploitative practices of the film and television industry both sean penn and grispin glover pull out stunner performances a young sean penn is the most evocative so closely does he follow the actual gary footage but with strong nuances given to push the sense of the interaction the way harris wants it to go in the end the wide eyed naivety the original gary is what moved me when contrasted against these possible interpretations of his situation a film not to miss i have not seen anything else like it jacob
i was lucky enough to watch this without any pre viewing hype i was surprised at the resilience of the ghost s image in my mind the next day and the day after that i ve watched it times and each time i appreciate it even more the settings are gorgeous the town at dusk has beautiful lighting effects the marsh long shots and the house itself is sufficiently grown with moss the main hero is so likable and good natured that he is easily sympathized with to the person who complained that there wasn t enough spark in this film i d say that it s because the whole fight against the ghost is being waged by just this one person it is a fairly slow paced film with an unusual amount of time being spent pre and post ghost attack on developing his character with family and work life spoilers discussion i especially liked the turning point when he comes back to the main town and meets with the man helping him and explains about seeing the ghost he describes the woman in black and then at the end of the conversation he says that he is going back because after all what harm had she done to him the other man says you can t go back alone and lends the hero his dog the cute little dog offers a small respite of comic relief with it s bounding through the house and even into the locked room the many casual appearances of the ghost really freaked me out the woman shows up in mid shot at the church showing that it is not afraid of the church and is also not shy or bound to the house this is all in the very beginning another unbelievably memorable scene was with the kids outside of the church fence watching the funeral as the camera pans to the right the woman is seen in the background among the gravestones the older man won t even look at it but the kids are all yelling and taunting it crreeepy usually ghosts are hidden in shadows haunting specific locales or people as has been mentioned the ghost s malevolence and wrath are frightening and i feel it s attacks and the ending were perfect and fully justified the ending underlined the fact that the hero made a major mistake by going back to the house or perhaps he was marked no matter what by saving the gypsy girl the guy who plays the hotel manager is so believable and really fills the role well i have been spreading the word to my friends about how much i enjoyed this film and it is reassuring to see others feel the same i can see how people don t quite see the same masterpiece especially if they went into it with a lot of review hype i think another person summed it up when they said that this movie settled the question of whether or not ghosts could physically harm man whew i plan to watch it again tonight followed by the changeling aaww yeah any other films to recommend thanks
this movie is a true reflection of the australian resourcefulness that has been required to make this country what it is over the last years not pompous like the british not gung ho like the americans if either of those countries had attempted what this crew did it would have failed dismally either due to ignorance on the british part or too much faith in superior firepower on the american side true australians i e non imports are the only ones who can excel in modern military conflicts because they have had to improvise most of their adult lives just look at examples like gallipoli paschendale tobruk new guinea and vietnam
the second alternate gundam universe tale g gundam being the first gundam wing is yet another different view into the gundam verse the familiar elements are found but gundam wing is actually different then its counterparts the biggest being the gundams are nothing more than terrorists combating one lone organization in truth the series doesn t really become a show about war until episode but in truth the real conflict the eve wars don t happen until the later episodes the greatest positives of this series are it s characters all the main characters are fleshed out throughout the episode run and you can really sympathize with each of the roles their put in another great plus is the fantastic character and mecha design of the series the designs put some of it s other gundam counterparts to shame one of the biggest criticism of this series is how many die hard uc fans claim rip off of the original uc saga why gundam wing gets this rap when the more apparent uc clone of gundam seed is out there is beyond me true there are many moments lifted but their told in new ways and there are distinct differences as well take for example the usual comparison of zechs merquise and uc icon char aznable throughout the series zechs is more the outcast in the alliance and in ways oz as well while the red comet was shining symbol of zeon another big difference is the fact zechs loses a lot soldiers under his command hence the other nickname he s given in the early episodes killer of his own men char isn t given this label the problems with this series isn t the philosophy mumbo jumbo but two problems the first is the reused animation footage of the gundams attacks sure it s fun seeing heavy arms attack tanks ms and planes the first time but on it s fourth re use scenes like this do get old the second problem is that the entire series is supposed to take place during an entire year if you really think about all the events springing in the series a lot happens in just one lone year but i guess you can easily dismiss this fact when ignoring the intro s first lines every so often as it ranks this is probably the best of the alternate universe gundam tales and a great introduction into the gundam world after all this was the very first gundam anime to air in the us television
we have to remember that the s were practically a blank slate when it came to movies hollywood was in transition from patriotic war movies noir two reel oaters etc to movies with a message we had blackboard jungle on the waterfront and so on some folks might think that was an improvement i don t who was the mogul who said if you want to send a message call western union he was right these psychological thrillers are less entertainment than some kind of remote therapy this one is a pip it s about three sisters trying to wrest control of their dead father s estate one of them maybe the only one worth redemption enlists the aid of the company pilot to help her keep the rest of the family at bay he s initially in it for the bucks but eventually falls for her meanwhile the rest of the family schemes to sabotage the romance the results are predictable you get a little bit of everything in this movie sexual tension between the sisters a little subtle masochism hereditary insanity if there is such a thing we never get to meet the parents but they must really have been screwed up the cast is practically unknown one or two of the actors sound vaguely familiar the acting is so bad it s hard to believe it was released under the united artists umbrella by a company called bel air productions it was shot in and around la mostly at night and probably without permits the end was so bizarre that i thought it was a joke it was as if they ran out of money and the producer decided to wrap it up in the middle of a scene i can t explain it not even to myself but i gave this pile of trash an i m familiar with the term it s so bad it s good but i don t think i ever ran into the phenomenon before well maybe hot rods to hell but this one certainly fits you might want to try this if you love movies that seem like they were made in somebody s basement
this is one excellent sammo hung movie actually this is a great piece of hong kong action cinema the story tells the story of pedicab drivers in macao looking for love and getting mixed up w a vicious pimp the performances are excellent and the characters are all likable and well defined the story is involving and has enough romance drama comedy and suspense to keep one watching between fight scenes sammo hung proves here that he s probably the best fight choreographer in the business the action is simply amazing esp the fight w lau kar leung and the finale billy chow and sammo hung are amazing a must see for any fan of action
this is the kind of film that if it were made today it would probably star sandra bullock and hugh grant actually now that i think about it this one is quite liable to be remade one day it s pleasant but with no depth whatsoever it suffers from the almost fatal miscasting of james stewart in a role he is about years too old for and as a result there is no chemistry between him and the beautiful kim novak ernie kovacs in the small supporting role of an aspiring writer is the only actor in the film whose performance approaches what you might call wit
baby face is a precode melodrama starring a very young barbara stanwyck an almost unrecognizable george brent and theresa harris it s about a girl who goes to the city to make good or should i say make time stanwyck s father has been pimping her for one reason or another her whole life in dingy depressed filthy erie pennsylvania after her father dies one older father type who knows what she s been through and truly cares about her future advises her to go to the big city and take advantage of opportunities there and not the easy ones and to take the high road in life note that i saw the censored version and not the uncut this part of the film was redone for the censors she and chico harris go to new york where lily nickname baby face decides the low road s a lot smoother and will get her where she wants to go a lot faster in the movie s most famous scene the camera moves us up the corporate ladder by taking us from floor to floor as lily sleeps her way to the top she finally corrals the big man himself and is able to quit her day job trouble follows and she s soon involved in a huge scandal stanwyck wears lots of makeup and for most of the film is cool as a cucumber as she seduces one man after another with no regrets and she s great at playing the innocent victim in one scene she sits staring at a king s ransom in jewels while wearing a black dress that looks like it s decorated with diamonds at the top then she asks chico for another case and that s filled with more jewelry plus securities all in a day s work theresa harris was an interesting talent she could be played down or glamorous and was a talented singer and dancer as well here she sings or hums the movie s theme st louis woman throughout she worked in literally dozens of movies and is very good here as a friend of stanwyck s her best work being in the precode era as a bizarre byproduct of the code blacks were often given less to do in films after it was put in place precode films could be more sexually blatant and therefore though they re years old seem more modern even though these films didn t have to have moral endings baby face learns her lessons how like life it is after all there were several endings of this film all with the same message the one i saw had an added scene but apparently there were two other endings that didn t pass the censors there wasn t a code but there were always censors at any rate it s a neat surprise baby face is an important film in movie history a must see
the night listener held my attention with robin williams shining as a new york city radio host who becomes enamored with his friendship with a year old boy rory culkin who is very ill williams has never met the boy in person as they have only been in contact by talking on the telephone however williams ex boyfriend nice job from bobby cannavale raises doubt about the boy which prompts williams to arrange a meeting with him in person what follows makes a permanent impact on williams in a way he does not expect i will leave it at that toni collette also stars i enjoyed this film with toni collette giving a memorable portrayal of culkin s adoptive mother sandra oh also starred as williams friend the night listener is inspired by actual events and it has a somber almost creepy silence throughout at times it is predictable no thanks to some of the reviews i read before seeing the movie and just due to logic but i liked it anyway i enjoy williams in roles like this more so than his comedic characters so that was an added bonus for me recommended
now i had the pleasure of first viewing contaminated man when it premiered on tv back in december of an infectious disease expert william hurt looses his family when an unknown disease enters his home and kills them now some years later he is now in russia or someplace i m not sure where exactly all i know is it takes place somewhere in that area anyway because of budget cutbacks at an infectious disease laboratory they are forced to lay off most of their workers one of them a disgruntled security guard named joseph muller played peter weller best known for his role as the indestructible robocop goes in there and demands that they give him his job back he needs this job because he is divorced and he needs it to pay child support so he goes in there a fight breaks out and some things get knocked over dangerous things it s soon discovered that muller has been infected with a deadly pathogen in fact it s so deadly one drop of his blood will kill a person in matter of seconds soon word gets out and the disease expert hurt is called in to investigate and he later teamed up with an american reporter now muller is determined to get home to see his wife and son and will stop at nothing even if he has to infect the entire russian population now as i said before this film is a lot like falling down we have a disturbed person weller here michael douglas in falling down who will stop at nothing to accomplish there goal even if they have to kill a few people in the process next we have a hero type person hurt here robert duvall in falling down who is both sympathetic and determined to stop the antagonist contaminated man is in fact a very good film with a good story line and some very good performances
if you like original gut wrenching laughter you will like this movie if you are young or old then you will love this movie hell even my mom liked it great camp
this movie came and went in the theaters due to the nature of it you can see why it wasn t well received it was unfairly panned because of its subject matter more than the actual film itself higher learning is not spectacular but it was good film that tried to talk about a feared subject in america racism plot story higher learning is mostly centered around malik played by omar epps a naive track star who is has to deal with not being fast enough and a stern professor played by laurence fishburne he befriends fudge ice cube as well as a gorgeous lady named deja tyra banks later on they end up having to deal with some skinheads on campus remy play by michael rapaport is confused kid who ends up befriending some local skinheads on campus once they impose their views on him he becomes as racist as they are opinion higher learning is not without its flaws character development is scarce okay performances by omar epps tyra banks and the leader of the skinheads whose name i forgot busta rhymes doesn t fit in this movie at all plus women turning gay after being abused by men was clich before this film so you know i didn t like that part of the film with kristy swanson other than that this movie wasn t half bad laurence fishburne was good as professor phipps even though i could do without the accent fudge was ice cube s best performance and michael rapaport was good as the confused remy all in all it was one of john singleton s best movies and is one is one of the reasons i frown on the rubbish he puts out now cinema needs more movies like higher learning mississippi burning and american history x and less movies like baby boy fast furious and a very pointless remake of shaft
this video is so hilariously funny it makes everything elseby eddie murphy seem very disappointing even beverly hills cop and the nutty professor which just goes to show you how good this really is to be honest i don t think that i ve everlaughed at something as much as this including naked gun and the rarely seen bargearse this show is amazing although it must be said that it is certainly filled with the word beginning with f that is four letters long plus its extended version beginning with m but it didn t bother me see it the funniest thing i ve ever seen and probably the funniest you ever have too
this film i thought was the great journey that forrest gump should have been it s a rare treat to watch a cable movie in the middle of the day and come across a foreign film that is done so well this film is very well acted and i strongly suggest it to anyone who can take sub titles
in this muppet movie kermit miss piggy fozzie gonzo rowlf scooter camillia dr teeth floyd animal janice and zoot are college graduates who decide to bring their successful college musical manhattan melodies to broadway unfortunately no producer will even meet with the muppets after being denied by too many producers scooter suggests that the muppets decide to move on on their own however kermit still believes that he can get his show on broadway but after he finally does and let s everybody know that he sold the show kermit get s amnesia and the others don t know where he is this features many great scenes including a live action sequence that introduced the muppet babies a wedding sequence filled with muppets including the sesame street cast and traveling matt from fraggle rock scooter as a movie theatre usher and a scene where rizzo and the other rats cook breakfast my only complaint is that more characters weren t included more sure many of them appear at the wedding but there should have been some significant roles for bunsen beaker beauregard and sweetums and lips should have been part of the electric mayhem in this movie like he was in the muppet show s last season and the great muppet caper and miss piggys dog foo foo should have been with her as well after all rizzo the rat also performed by steve whitmire had a big part in this movie and he wasn t very well known at the time
this first part of the brd trilogy has more passion and plot density than lola but less of the magic of veronica voss the political musings have point to them we see the shortages after the war how the blackmarketers were able to control so much of the day to day life delicious moment when fassbinder playing a grifter tries to sell a complete set of kleist to schygulla who remarks that burning books don t provide much warmth she really wants firewood there s some clumsiness in the first hour the scene in maria s room with the black soldier interrupted by hermann s appearance should go quicker the train scene when maria meets karl oswald falls flat when she insults the gi i cringed it was so bad but as the story develops and the years go by i was drawn more and more into this glossy cold world
possibly the best movie ever created in the history of jeffrey combs career and one that should be looked upon by all talent in hollywood for his versatility charisma and uniqueness he brings through his characters and his knowledge of acting
the visuals and effects are up to par with the the original film and provide a lot of entertainment even if the storyline is essentially the same as the first two films it also seems a lot more erotically charged than i remember the other films being if you re a big fan of flying prehensile hair and tongues that can reach all the way down into your stomach you ll like this film
never viewed this film and consider it a great classic with great veteran actors in the period that this film was made people in america were different there was no tv or all the modern things we have today except the radio and the starting out of great films being made in hollywood sweet innocent tales of young romance between a young girl or guy was viewed differently than it is today ann shirley murder my sweet played a young orphan gal who was called carrot top because of her red hair and found herself being taken into a home of two elderly folks who were like two wise owls and watched over ann shirley it was a small town and everyone knew everyone and if anything happened the entire town found out about it within minutes it is a down to earth film with nice decent people trying to help each other in a very very simple way of living today it seems very corn ball and stupid but believe me this was the way people were in america during the s and they were a great generation that loved good family films
four teenage girls in a suburb of los angeles get into all kinds of trouble parties drugs cops mixed up parents older boyfriends jodie foster sort of the mother hen of the pack tries keeping everyone together like a family like the family unit she s never had and the heartbreaking thing about the movie is that she can t slowly everyone grows up and goes away that precise plot point though underscored throughout is unfortunately tampered with did we really need a long sequence with scott baio outracing a car full of thugs on his skateboard or an even longer sequence also with baio where foster has a strange soliloquy about the pain of illusion some of the dialogue in fact is downright loopy and i didn t much care for an edit late in the film that segues clumsily from a death to a wedding but these are nitpicks in what is basically a very sensitive story about the loss of a tight bond and jodie s face at the ending speaks volumes if viewers do get choked up at the end the movie has earned this it doesn t pander for tears or ask for sympathy it shows us an example of friendship and hopes we understand from
this is a very dramatic and suspenseful movie there are many plots and turns the story or the director opens question marks on the death row or presumed crimes committed by black people this film is very well directed by arne glimcher and the fine sound of james newton howard is excellent strong performance of sean connery and ed harris if you liked this one don t miss true crimes or the hurricane my wife and me gave
joe buck jon voight decides he s going to leave his small life in texas and make it big in the big city the women are there for the asking and the men are mainly tutti fruttis wide eyed he comes to new york city not prepared for the series of humiliating misadventures he experiences one worse than the other in the middle of that chaos he meets and befriends rico ratso rizzo dustin hoffmann a homeless looking man who lives in an apparently condemned building there isn t much of a story as midnight cowboy is a series of vignettes destined to bring forth not only joe buck s plights in the city but also inter cut to his past and show us in shock cuts and semi psychedelic dream sequences snippets of his past his failed relationship with his girlfriend annie jennifer salt who was gang raped his abandonment by his mother and his apparent abuse by his grandmother who also had a habit of hustling men for money an air of pessimism dominates the film almost from the wistful beginning as nilsson plays throughout the opening credits his deceptively flowery everybody s talking we feel that even while we want joe to eventually make his mark in the city the odds are high he won t and will end up working for pennies in a dead end job shown in a masterful shot from his outside point of view later in the film as he watches a man work as a dishwasher in a soup kitchen through a window and sees himself we know from the look in his eyes he does not want to end like this a dark story of dashed hopes john schlesinger creates haunting images of lost souls at the end of the s and at the center the prevailing friendship between two men as they struggle to make some sort of meaning to their lives amidst the elusive comfort of a dignified life there is the implied notion that they may have been lovers ratso s reaching out to hug joe in the party scene and their the final embrace at the end certainly points at this but this is essentially a buddy film one that manages to survive literally to the death and bring some form of hope to joe who at the end in florida seems much changed older wiser
this movie is such cheesy goodness a bunch of people trapped in an abandoned school they start getting killed off they know they are being stalked so what do they do one girl decides to take a bath another decides to cheat on her husband who is also there with an old boyfriend so they somehow find a bed in an old abandoned school and go at it and it comes through with the gore and the t a and it s also interesting from a historical sociological point of view where the usual s slasher is a reflection of how we view ourselves or how adults view young people or as hollywood views the rest of the country this has a unique perspective this is a brit film made to be an american slasher it s hilarious to see how often the british actors who are trying to speak american unintentionally slip back in to their uk accents if you like cheesy s slashers like pieces then you will like this one
upon the straight story release in it was praised for being david lynch s first film that ignored his regular themes of the macabre and the surreal based on a true story of one man and his journey to visit his estranged brother on a john deere mower at first glance its an odd story for lynch to direct yet as the story develops you can see some of lynch s trademark motifs coming through lynch s focus on small town america and its inhabitants is still as prevalent as in his previous efforts such as blue velvet or twin peaks but the most notable difference is that the weirdness is curbed down the restrictions imposed means that the film has the notable accolade of being one of the few live action films that i can think of that features a g rating incredibly significant this films stands as evidence that beautiful and significant family films can be produced the straight story was the first feature which lynch directed where he had no hand at writing for many lynch devotees this was a huge negative point almost universally acclaimed the only overly negative review by james brundage of filmcritic com focused on this very criticism that it wasn t a typical lynch film lynch is struggling within the mold of a g rated story that isn t his own brundage claims with his protagonist alvin straight quoting lines directly from confucious he argues that the story is weak and the dialogue even worse yet this is about the only criticism that many will read for the film whilst it is true that it is not lynch in the sense of eraserhead lost highway or mulholland drive all films which i also adore the straight story features a different side of lynch that is by no means terrible if you are a lynch fan it is most important to separate that side of lynch with this feature the narrative is slow and thoughtful which gives you a real sense of the protagonist s thoughts as he travels to his destination alvin constantly is reminded about his past and his relationships with his wife children and his brother yet particularly significant is that there are no flashbacks which only adds to the effect which reminded me of my conversations with my grandparents the conclusion arrives like watching a boat being carried down a slow meandering river and it is beautiful to watch the natural landscapes of the us are accentuated and together with the beautiful soundtrack by angelo badalamenti makes me yearn to go to america the performances are also excellent with every actor believable in their roles and richard farnsworth is particularly excellent his oscar nomination was greatly deserved and it was a shame that he didn t win regardless however it is probably the finest swan song for any actor so whilst the straight story features none of lynch s complex narratives or trademark dialogue the film is a fascinating character study about getting old and comes highly recommended
rachel mcadams cillian murphy wes craven the dream team this is one of the best thrillers of a great plot a great twist a great eye candy this is one of wes craven s greatest movies apart from scream and a nightmare on elm street this could be the best the plot is one of the best things about the movie and it is very simple lisa reisert mcadams a struggling hotel manager boards a late red eye back to la little does she know that she has been followed by jackson ripner aka jack the ripper murphy they have a couple of drinks and end up sitting together on the plane later he reveals to her that he is an assassin who was sent to kill the secreteary of homeland security who is staying in lisa s hotel and what does this have to with lisa well she would have to move his room to the top suite so they can bomb him if she doesn t ripner will murder her father brian cox the twist and bringing of the story really gives it the extra zing and the side characters and the side jokes really add to it overall definitely one of the best thrillers of definitely worth the see out of stars
wonderful movie with good story great humour some great one liners and a soundtrack to die for i ve seen it times so far the american audiences are going to love it
it seems a lot of imdb comments on this film are biased in the sense that they try to compare it to an older version true hollow man is a remake of sorts of the invisible man but that s where the similarities end hollow man is an entertaining movie period if you watch a movie with the intention of finding as many flaws as possible then you shouldn t watch movies in the first place true some movies are plain horrendous and unbearable but hollow man manages to entertain and make you think what you would do if you were invisible and if you had your ex getting laid with one of your friends kevin bacon stars as a eccentric scientist who along with a team of collaborators discover the way to make animals invisible now his mission is to make them visible again when this team of young scientists working as you might guess for the pentagon think they have the formula for making animals visible again kevin bacon volunteers to be the first to try the new experimental drug after that of course things go wrong as kevin bacon remains invisible for the rest of the movie and is obliged to wear a latex mask so his collaborators know where he is feelings of paranoia and desperation begin to take over kevin s character and when he finds out that his ex girlfriend and collaborator elisabeth shue is having a torrid affair with another of the young scientists in the team he finally snaps the movie then turns into a hybrid of alien and a slasher flick but that s not saying it s a bad turn there are scares and chills and the movie moves at a nice pace the special effects are top notch a quality always prevalent in all of paul verhoeven s films as we get to see some body reconstitution sequences never seen on a movie before if there s anything to complain about perhaps is the predictability of the situations herein by the first hour of the movie you know kevin bacon will make the jump from being weird and eccentric to being a homicidal lunatic in the end and the ending is a bit abrupt but despite this hollow man is still worth watching if you want to know what a truly bad movie is then waste your money on fear dot com with stephen dorf or the even worse the untold or sasquatsh with land henriksen now that is hollow out of
just the kind of movie i love some very good british actors as well as the one and only sharon stone catherine tramell stone masterfully manipulates a well educated group of people s lives playing on their frailties to collect experiences to write a murder mystery book she plays the female psychopath quite well while using her ample sex appeal to convincingly portray what could be considered one of the ultimate black widows tramell is use to dark places within society and freely partakes in sadomasochistic flings in the never visit after dark side of town from the beginning there is nothing short of an r rating here from the dialog alone stone could also be described as a sort of female hannibal lecter an emotionless femme fatal without the meal plan
i watched fido on some movie channel and i have to say that i ve become an instant fan the film feels like a comic book that perfectly captures the look and feel of the surreal s you know the wholesome decade when they danced to elvis while dropping nuclear bombs in the desert just for the heck of it people were so naive back then that it s frightening and the idea that those clean cut folks would find it normal to have zombies as pets actually works here kudos to this canadian production the colorful crisp cinematography and the excellent cast including carrie anne moss billy connolly henry czerny and the kid it s a shame this film wasn t a bigger hit it deserved more recognition it s much better than the stuff from tim burton or the shaun of the dead team oh well it s an instant classic nonetheless
when i sat down to watch largo winch i expected nothing more than action scenes and fascinating cars when i stood up i ve seen both of these and more karl roden was finally not the antagonist in a movie to start with kristin scott thomas played her role well but the real two stars in my opinion were tomer sisley and miki manojlovic both acting superbly in radivoje bukvic portrayed goran well the mixed linguistics brought a nice color to the movie but i understand why people would get bored with it the scenery of hong kong and especially the stunning croatian seaside both amazed me and i hardly wanted to take my eyes off the screen when largo entered the unbelievably beautiful island rolls royce phantom mercedes s and bmw if anyone loves expensive limousine type cars this is their movie it is also a movie for people who love action sequences good acting landscapes of extremal beauty and above all a fast paced well written action movie with dazzling combat and a thoroughly twined inner drama my vote as it has enlightened a gloomy day is
given how corny these movies are you gotta figure that they must have had fun making them the movie focuses on a house that strangely accommodates whomever lives there the inhabitants were author charles hillyer denholm elliott with hair who gets haunted by one of his own creations philip grayson peter cushing who gets a little too close to a wax statue john reid christopher lee whose daughter s cuteness is apparently a facade and actor paul henderson jon pertwee on the verge of getting a little too much into character the house that dripped blood is actually worth seeing well duh it stars peter cushing and christopher lee aside from just being neat there might be some undertones it might be calling into question the issue of real horror vs assumed horror like in the shining we might ask whether the house hotel itself holds some memory of past events and if absolutely nothing else ingrid pitt as paul s co star is hot hot hot around the time that this came out she also starred in countess dracula and the vampire lovers also with peter cushing maybe she like barbara steele will remain known only as a scream queen but mark my words she is a hot scream queen i d like to see ingrid pitt and barbara steele co star in something i guess that the only weird scene so to speak is where denholm elliott is wearing a pink shirt and fluffy jacket you read that right what kind of a name is denholm anyway oh well a very cool movie
an excellent period murder melodrama with fontaine effectively playing against her earlier naive wallflower type in a role that reportedly olivia dehavilland turned down that s fine because fontaine is wonderful scripted by charles bennett who had written for hitchcock in the thirties and also later penned the excellent script for the classic british horror film night of the demon the opening scene where ivy visits a sinister fortune teller played by the wonderful una o connor the screecher of james whale fame is a tour de force and the film maintains interest throughout the numerous sinister machinations i hope to see this film on dvd someday but despair of that ever happening because it seems to be an undeservedly obscure film fortunately i got to see it on amc some seven or eight years ago but have not seen since catch it if you can
though the plot elements to the eighth day seem like they have been done plenty of times the film still has much of the spark mystery and symbolism that jaco van dormal s first film had though not as good as toto the hero which will always remain on my favorites list the movie still leaves us with lots of emotions daniel auteil from s flavorless the closet downplays his part afraid to overact rightfully so the role could have easily been ruined if the actor was overly dramatic however i felt the part needed a bit more realism to it focusing more on the character itself instead of simply the character s growth don t walk into this movie expecting the dark humor and unexpected twists that you got from toto the hero because you will be disappointed however the film still serves as a decent if not flawed movie
ok the film wasn t going to win any awards and it is pure bubblegum and it is a modern update on it s a wonderful life but it s just come out as a cheap release on dvd and there are a lot worse ways of blowing you get a film that has a surprisingly strong cast but for most they were still a year or two from becoming b list celebs however it s an enjoyable way of passing an hour and half just don t think too much in it
as serials go zorro s fighting legion is one of the best action serials of the s made in a period when the studios could still field a large cast this one has wall to wall action throughout its chapters in the president of the newly formed republic of mexico benito juarez carleton young is trying to put his new country on a solid financial footing to that end he has arranged to have rich gold shipments forwarded to the capitol from the local san mendolita mine members of the local council plot to steal the shipments on behalf of don del oro a gold armored god who with the aid of the local yaqui tribe hopes to install himself as the ruler of mexico opposing him is don francisco guy d ennery who forms a legion of locals to aid juarez when don franciso is murdered by don del oro s men a stranger the fopish don diego reed hadley arrives in town diego aka zorro takes over the legion with the help of his friends ramon william corson and juan budd buster the token heroine of the piece is ramon s sister volita sheila d arcy both diego and ramon hold seats on the local ruling counsil it soon becomes apparent that some of the other members of the council are in league with don del oro first there is the chairman of the council leander de cordova the head of the militia manuel john merton chief justice pablo c montague shaw and gonzolez edmund cobb zorro suspects that one of these men is don del oro but which one what follows are several hair raising escapes by zorro and his confederates from the followers of don del oro we have the ever present collapsing rope bridge the deep chasm between two cliffs over which only zorro can jump to safety and the usual assortment of explosions fires and coaches and wagons crashing or going over the cliff hats off here to republic s fine team of stunt men lead by the legendary yakima canutt and the yrigoyens bill and joe canutt performs his signature stunt jumping on a team of runaway horses and then falling beneath the coach which he repeated in other films including john ford s stagecoach the same year anyway zorro finally unmasks the false god don del oro and restores peace to the valley before riding off into the sunset in chapter others in the cast include jim pierce curley dresden and charlie king as don del oro s hence men and if you look closely you may spot bits by future serial star and lone ranger clayton moore and stuntman canutt in bits big jim pierce by the way may be best remembered for playing tarzan in s tarzan and the golden liom and for his marriage to joan burroughs the daughter of tarzan creator edgar rice burroughs thoroughly enjoyable
this is indeed a treat for every bolan fan some might think that it s a little over the top and that it is only about ringo and marc s egos but i think it s similar to any other concert video except for the fact that this is marc bolan not just any guy i especially liked the music video for children of the revolution with elton john and ringo starr this clip alone is worth all the money i can t believe they did not release this version as the single the movie is really superb especially for us danes now i wasn t alive during the s but danes in general was totally shot out from what was happening around them the media didn t play or show any of the popular music back then including marc bolan and t rex they only played a little with the doors only the really popular songs though so i know from my dad that seeing this gives him back a part of his youth he never got to experience i wont make this too long so if you re the least bit fan of marc bolan you need to see this you might find it boring or as said before a little over the top but at least you ve seen one of the best musicians ever in action only thing that disappoints me a little is that ride a white swan isn t on the tape but i forgive it since jeepster and get it on are so wonderfully played
the main problem i see with this film is its score which screams with every note this is a cheap ass movie there s not much more to say here the score just plain sucked the second problem which i see as quite severe as well as it involves the unwinding of the plot near the end of the film one of the the money shots if you will is the dialogue between martha adrienne barbeau and the sunflower man richard ziman in which martha is revealed to be the leader of the experiment at all times during this dialogue the viewer is very much aware that s he is listening to a movie dialogue in other words suspension of disbelief breaks down here the integrity of a believable dialogue between two people is sacrificed for a willy nilly stuffing of information the movie makers wish to impart to the audience the third problem was the casting of adrienne barbeau while i honestly believe her to be a fabulous actress within her oeuvre i feel that this part may have been too much of a stretch the main point of her performance that didn t seem to mesh was the spectrum across which the character moves through the film from a loving mother of a troubled family to an almost rambo like woman on a mission this aspect of the script would obviously have been a stretch for any actress and one cannot place too much blame therefore upon barbeau to the degree that she fairly competently acted her part however i would only call this a moderately severe problem to the film as a whole finally the film did a wonderful job in the first half building a creep factor most notably during its horror flashes i feel that the film would have benefited by more of a commitment to these flashes as a mechanism for preventing a fizzling of the creep factor in the second half of the movie so what s my holistic grading of this piece i d give it a solid c to b depending upon how much credit you re inclined to give the makers for producing this film on a limited budget even with two severe and two moderately severe problems the film is premised on the solid plot of the jungian side of nazi mysticism i see no problems with plot development or coherence the dialogue with the noted exception above is downright brilliant in places especially the all important keystone scene between mother and daughter at the beginning of the movie as mentioned the creep factor was well crafted if a bit fizzly in the second half and nicholas brendan who also associated produced delivered a wonderful performance all in all this film is definitely worth the view see it with a nazi you love
a comedy of epically funny proportions from the guys that brought you south park and most of the guys from orgazmo this vulgur obscence movie has utterly disgusting eggotistical and satirical content it portrays incredibly cruel treatment of humans and animals i love it this is some funny stuff really funny two loser friends create a game in thier driveway which explodes into a national sensation corruption and greed and blackmail turn the sport sour and its up ta coop ta fix it and along the way you will laugh alot that s all there is enjoy
i love this film it s one of those i can watch again and again it is acted well by a good cast that doesn t try too hard to be star studded the premise of a newly widowed housewife who turns to selling pot to make ends meet could have been made into an americanised turd of a movie or an action thriller either would have killed the film completely the film plays out like an ealing comedy with a terrific feel good factor throughout it is worth watching just for the scene with the two old ladies and a box of cornflakes no that s not a spoiler
halloween is one of the best examples of independent film it s very well made and has more psychological elements to it than you might realize at first glance it is a simple movie told very well the music is perfect and is one of the most haunting scores if you haven t seen this movie yet you must check it out the cast is all terrific i wish they had never made sequel after sequel the first one was by far the best and should have ended like it did without having a sequel it was fun to see jamie lee curtis in the movie she hasn t seemed to age she s just as gorgeous today without the hairdo and seventies clothes the scenes through the mask are one of the scariest things ever
this show started out with great mystery episodes i think everyone is in the first or episodes after that the show started playing short episodes with shaggy scooby doo and scrappy doo i think hanna barbera productions had to change minutes episodes into short episodes some of the voice actors became unavailable after or episodes frank welker who played fred became unavailable i think the voice of velma changes after first episodes because the first voice actress who played velma was unavailable and the network ordered the hanna barbera studio to make more shorts with shaggy scooby doo and scrappy doo because the ratings were high so they had to make more shorts i wish they were mysteries like episodes still it is a good show
when you actually find a video game to be scary or disturbing you know that the developers have done some very serious and hard work to make the whole thing work undying used the unreal engine but had very little resemblance to that game when it came to actual gameplay speaking of gameplay the pace is slowed down and the sheer difficulty in progressing through the very hard to kill enemies makes for a very unqiue gameplay experience the production values are so high that you may even forget that it is a video game the game itself is also packed with loads of secrets that you have to uncover using special vision the level design in fantastic and the weapons as well as the enemies will really shock you
have not seen this film in a very long time and greatly enjoyed kim novak playing the role as gil holroyd who is an actual witch and has an aunt named queenie holroyd who is also a witch and gillian also has a brother warlock named nick played by jack lemmon when gillian sets her eyes on shep henderson james stewart who is engaged to a girl he is going to marry gillian performers some magic spells with a cat and changes his mind about his intended bride and then becomes very lust full and falls in love with gillian the story tells that a real witch cannot fall in love blush or cry and this begins to prove a big problem between shep and gillian so nick and aunt queenie decided they have to do something about this situation great film to view over and over again and a great classic film from
the sopranos was probably the last best show to air in the s its sad that its over its was the best show on hbo if not on tv not everything was spelled out for you throughout you had to think it was brilliant the cast was excellent tony james gandolphini is a great actor and played his character excellent as well as the others each character had flaws thats what made them so real and allowed the viewers to connect with them and thats one reason it lasted so long the last episode was good i m not sure how to take it many different things can be construed by the ending id like to think that tony didn t die but meadow walked in and sat down with them and that the blackout was just for suspense tony will have to go to trial and deal with that hopefully is not dead thats how i feel long live the sopranos and tony soprano
i first saw breaking glass in and thought that it would be one of the movie classics this film is a great look into the music industry with a great cast of performers this is one film that should be in the collection of everyone and any one that wants to get into the music industry i can t wait for it to be available on dvd
if you havn t seen this movie i highly recommend you do it s an excellent true story i love alison lohman she is so talented side note i also loved her in th heaven the whole story line is amazing and the way they chose there characters waz awesome the acting in this film isvery awesome
henry thomas was great his character held my attention i was so into the story that i forgot it wasn t real i wanted him to keep the baby and see what a special person he was the other people in the story were essential in the makeup of his character the way they banded together to help one another was truly awe inspiring i love movies that show the real side of human emotions without having to hit you over the head in that you are not smart enough to figure things out for yourself
i enjoyed it in general i m not a fan of comedies and comedians but i do like whoopi i m also partial to sci fi fantasy and the dinosaur craze i read for pleasure but when i m feeling over stressed or really mind dead i watch tv movies to escape theodore rex enabled me to do so that makes it a success in my eyes i didn t even walk away to do something else while it was running whether or not it was rated as good or not doesn t really matter to me and no i m not a juvenile nor am i a moron
for those of you who have read rohinton mistry s highly respected novel this film will definitely impress you because of how honorable an adaptation it is with the exception of one minor subplot sturla gunnarson s feature film debut is an almost dead on recreation of the book down to the last line for those of you who have not read the novel this movie might be a little tricky it is certainly not a large cinematic drama story instead it has a strong element of realism to it but i would not have it any other way the best way to describe such a long journey to movie fans would be to say that it is a small scale hindu version of fiddler on the roof instead of a jewish russian milkman the protagonist gustad noble is a banker in s bombay during the time of the muslim hindi war with pakistan he is forced to deal with a number of unexpected problems in his life including his sick daughter his individualist eldest son a distant friend who gets him involved with some dirty money and an unhealthy neighborhood the ending is not a happy one nor is it a sad one but that is essentially what realism involves such a long journey is a fine little movie but if you want to see it then good luck finding it unlike the novel it has received very little release
soldier isn t a great movie and everyone that hated it has plenty of good reasons but i liked soldier alot partly because my expectations were so low that what i saw surprised me first the art direction is tight and well executed as far as science fiction backdrops go soldier was doing things with more design then the genre the sets costumes and props were all consistent and competently executed i didn t love all of their future military style but i was impressed with the effort for me this made the movie worth the time it took to watch second i m a kurt russell fan i grew up watching this guy in some of the most memorable movies of my youth the barefoot executive and his john carpenter films soldier is essentially an action movie and the role of sergeant todd is an essential action hero it s not an award winning role but kurt musters up convincing emotion with very little dialog third the fight scenes and battles are well choreographed this isn t iron monkey or even the matrix but once again it far exceeds the average level of quality in the genre if you haven t seen it and you like sci fi action films pick it up if you pass at your rental depot of choice just don t expect the next bladerunner
this movies chronicles the life and times of william castle he made a series of low budget horror films in the s s that he sold with gimmicks in ghosts you need viewers to see the ghosts they were in color the film was in b w the tingler had theatre seats equipped with a buzzer that jolted the audience when a monster escapes into a movie theatre marabre issued a life insurance policy to all members in case they were frightened to death the movies themselves were pretty bad but the gimmicks had people rushing to see them in this doc there are interviews with directors inspired by castle actors in his movies and his daughter it also gets into his home life and the kind of man he was by all accounts he was a great guy the documentary is affectionate very funny and absolutely riveting it s very short under minutes and there s never a dull moment a must see for castle fans and horror movie fans my one complaint there were very few sequences shown from his pictures that aside this is just great
let us begin by saying that this film s english title the power of kangwon province is an absolute misnomer it is because in hong sang soo s film there are no actual shots of wars troubles and conflicts so the idea of establishing power of a province is neither suitable nor valid in the context of this film if we were to judge this film by its korean language title kangwon do ui him is going to appear as a cryptic statement about emotional turmoils of its young protagonists whose minds are not at rest hong sang soo has also directed a highly prolific visual document about erratic choices made by people in their lives the people in question are a couple of young girls who are constantly in the process of displaying their moods whims and fancies if making a film out of nothingness can be claimed as a film maker s meritorious virtue then hong sang soo has to be saluted as a courageous film maker whose films speak volumes about ubiquitous nothingness of human relationships sentiments and lives whether one likes it or not this is the only fair conclusion that be deduced from this particular film
fraidy cat the th of these cartoons is a good one at least i like it so i m surprised that this is getting mixed reviews this one is more of a macabre story than a funny one although it has its moments of comedy the atmosphere is dark and spooky suspense is another strong element here as for humor it s mostly dark humor in this short tom listens to a creepy radio show at night and is absolutely terrified because it is about ghosts something he believes while tom is scared to death jerry is watching everything and can t help but laugh the whole time in fact jerry quickly finds a way to torture him more and more with the help of a white shirt and a vacuum cleaner he creates a big ghost tom lives the scariest experience of his whole life although jerry scares tom without a good reason the way the story is made ends up being funny plus once again there is no violence here because this is one of tom jerry s oldest cartoons however i don t get that joke of tom s lives nearly sucked into the vacuum cleaner when tom finally finds out that it was all a jerry s scheme and that jerry made a fool out of him jerry is caught with the hand in the cookie jar he deserves to be discovered yet tom shows an incredible patience before reacting he angrily looks at jerry for about a minute the funny thing is that jerry invites tom to laugh with him and takes about half a minute to realize that tom is looking at him with a very serious face jerry tries to be funny but tom doesn t laugh overall this is a different peculiar and remarkable tom jerry experience
i am glad i saw this film having seen some of the director s other films in the past i thought the production values was great like the costumes and settings with the bridge it was interesting to see how the concept of spirit and demons were handled i do agree with some of the other comments about the fight scenes they were hard to follow at times ultimately a moral tale it would be interesting to know what some japanese viewers thought of the film it is a film i would like to see again some scenes like the ones where benkai and the prince were fighting on a psychic level were well done i did come out of the cinema thinking what has just happened here intense

now admittedly i m no ardent student of the genre as a matter of fact i ve tended always to shy away from westerns because in spite of all their critical cachet as america s primal stories or whatever they seem to me to forever devolve into tiresome retreads of either shoot up the injuns the big gunfight or hey let s form a posse in other words it always seemed to me a genre so rooted in and tied to convention that it left precious little room for surprise or originality and yes i have seen at least some of the so called greats and unapologetically lump them into this negative assessment including stagecoach rio bravo my darling clementine and of course the infamous but profoundly dull clint eastwood sergio leone teamups in the s but when i saw this movie on tv as part of a commemorative jimmy stewart weekend upon his death i finally got it i understood at least in theory what the western mythos has to offer as a serious thematic preoccupation aside from just action and thrills it is the push pull between lawlessness and order the american west represented freedom but also the prospect of the wild the untamed respectable folk could get hurt out there which of course meant that perhaps just perhaps it wasn t meant for respectable folk and that the only residents should be the amoral and the shifty those who dispensed justice strictly from the barrel of their revolvers and where kill or be killed would ever be the law of the land in such an environment of course the true heroes are the ones who are ornery and free spirited enough to be out there in the first place and so reject society at least as it manifested itself on the eastern seaboard and yet have enough sense of justice to believe that a society based on chaos and fear just is not right catching and examining that disparity between law and disorder in the main character himself is i believe after seeing this movie the highest and truest goal of any western sadly it is so often not the case as the white hats are completely white the black ones completely black and let s not even get started talking about the indians ok and there is precious little shades of gray in between not in this one jimmy stewart plays a blatant fortune hunter who follows the trail of miners before him into the alaskan wilderness to prospect for gold he is joined in this by his lifelong buddy played by walter brennan perhaps the western clich character to end them all but nevertheless enjoyable here as always and no one else pointedly they are out for themselves and while stewart displays his patented charm come on we could never really dislike the guy now could we we are left with little doubt that his is basically a self centered self interested character none of his gosh or oh golly gee humanism is allowed to come through or rather it has to be earned by the end of the picture in the way i described above he must confront the lawlessness in himself and weigh it against the need for order and justice which are so blatantly lacking in the border town which serves as the miners starting point on their gold dust trail this town is ruled tightly by its wicked sheriff mr gannon played by john mcintire in one of the best bad guy performances i ve ever seen he comes on with so much charm and humor and has such a relaxed and interesting rapport with stewart that it actually takes awhile to recognize that he is the bad guy so that when it finally sinks in it does so with double force further by establishing a type of breezy if necessarily guarded camaraderie between mcintire and stewart the film plays up the notion of how close in temperament they really are and so how far a moral distance stewart must walk by the end of the film i won t go through all the twists and turns the plot takes see those for yourself as well as the rugged and gorgeous alaskan scenery filmed on location mind you not cheap painted stills that the studio made up what s key here is how much this story focuses upon character with great dialogue and character interaction substituting for gunplay much of the time although the film has just enough action and adventure to prevent it from ever being static read talky definitely one of the greatest performances i ve seen from stewart showing he could play the renegade the man s man just as convincingly as the decent and upright guy next door if anything in fact his everyman qualities lend greater strength to his characterization making him seem less mythic or overblown like say eastwood or john wayne and more a three dimensional personage his relationship with brennan is well played understated but nevertheless touching with a faint suggestion of george and lenny from of mice and men an altogether different type of western i certainly have more westerns to see but this is for now my favorite and the yardstick by which i will necessarily judge all the others it deserves to be much better known and appreciated than it is
this is a very well made film meticulously directed and with some excellent character acting that at times is deeply moving for example the scene with the loyal but unsophisticated sidekick cop and his wife the plot is convincingly worked out and exciting the gangster character is particularly interesting and plays an almost metaphysical role in the life of the hero it s made clear that the cops are just as rough and ready as the underworld characters a couple of slight reservations i found the ending slightly one sided as it celebrates the hero s successful integration into the structure of the police and justice system which collapses the ambiguity of the police characters which has been maintained up to that point also i found the lead female character somewhat weak little more than a catalyst for the salvation of the hero all she seems to do is weep and swoon as the tough guys battle it out
richard linklater s beautifully directed mixture of youthful romance and paris travelogue is one of the s best thinking person s romantic movies julie delpy turns in one of the decade s most engaging performances as the parisian lass who spends a day with stranger on a train ethan hawke the dialogue and there is oodles of it is sometimes meandering and overly precious but this portrait of two young wannabe lovers making a romantic intellectual and spiritual connection to one another is full of wonderfully amusing touching and insightful moments
i went to the cinema with two of my friends and picked this movie out of hat totally not knowing what to expect and it turn out into a very enjoyable die laughing experience it s an excellent movie with very unexpected story very good dialogs and crazy humor all characters are obviously made in alan ford italian satiric comic style but that haven t bothered me for a second in fact this kind of loser bums line up made a movie quite unique and interesting sam rockwell gave very good and convincing role willian macy too clooney is hardly recognizable and brilliant but real star is actually guzman he made a role of his life in this movie the scene when his character cosimo dies in the movie is so hilarious that it made me choke and almost die with him highly recommended for all alan ford fans

ghosts that still walk is one of those films that grabs you and doesn t let go until the end especially when you see it as a child seeing the film as an adult you have to admit it isn t really all that scary but the story is very fascinating and contains allot of great mysterious scenes especially the ones with the creepy mummy one of the best scenes in the movie is without a doubt the scene with grandpa and grandma in their new rv the scene with the rocks is very exciting and pretty scary also the scenes where the main character discovers his mother s secret is pretty frightening okay the acting in the film isn t all that great and the film sometimes seems to get a little bit boring but overall ghosts that still walk is fun too bad only a few people saw this film this film really deserves better i just wanna say mr flocker you ve done a good job and for all you hollywood producers out there if you want to remake a movie remake this one
in rosenstrasse margarethe von trotta blends two stories to create a vibrant tapestry of love and courage the film depicts a family drama of estrangement between a mother and her daughter and the story of german women who staged a protest on rosenstrasse to free their jewish husbands from certain extermination in addition to the dramatization of historical events the focus of the film is on the saving of a child from the holocaust by a german and the result of the child s experience of losing her mother while ms von trotta shows that the courage of a small number of germans made a difference she does not use it to excuse german society indeed she shows how in the midst of torture and extermination the wealthy artists and intellectuals of german high society went on about their lives and parties oblivious to the suffering rosenstrasse opens in new york as a jewish widow ruth weinstein jutta lampe decides to sit shiva a seven day period of mourning that takes place following a funeral in which jewish family members devote full attention to remembering and mourning the deceased when her daughter hannah maria schrader is forbidden to receive phone calls from her fianc luis fedja van huet a non jew hannah questions why her mother has suddenly decided to follow an orthodox tradition that she previously rejected when ruth coldly rejects her cousin hannah questions her and learns about a woman named lena who took ruth in as a child when the latter s mother was deported and murdered by the nazis and she vows to find lena and discover the secret of her mother s past her quest takes her to berlin where she finds lena doris schade now ninety years old and interviews her on the pretext that she is a journalist researching certain aspects of the holocaust with unfailing memory lena tells her story of how as a young year old woman katja reimann she searched for her husband jewish pianist fabian israel fischer martin feifel who disappeared and was presumed to have been imprisoned despite the protection normally given jews in mixed marriages lena in a radiant performance by reimann discovers that her husband and other jews are being held prisoner in a former factory on the rosenstrasse standing together in the freezing night german women whose husband are missing congregate outside the building their numbers growing daily until they reach one thousand shouting give us back our husbands lena finds ruth svea lohde a young girl whose mother is in the building she takes care of her protecting her from the gestapo and raising her after her mother is killed lena comes from an aristocratic german family and her brother recently returned from stalingrad is a wehrmacht officer after being refused help from her father to free fabian she enlists the aid of her brother who tells a fellow officer i know what they do to the jews i saw it given his support she is bold enough to bypass channels and go to the top where her beauty and charm prove irresistible for the minister of culture joseph goebbels a known womanizer while this fictional part of the film has been criticized as degrading to the women protesters it is a historical fact that goebbels was very active in making the decisions affecting rosenstrasse the director margarethe von trotta an activist feminist and intellectual is no stranger to political drama she directed a film about socialist rosa luxembourg and marianne and julianne a story of the relationship between two sisters one of whom resorts to political violence to accomplish her liberal objectives in rosenstrasse a film she worked on for eight years she had to make compromises adding the present day fictional element in order to have her film produced that it works so well is a tribute to ms von trotta s artistry and the beautiful screenplay by pamela katz whose father was a refugee from leipzig the events at rosenstrasse give the lie to germans who say there was nothing we could do now von trotta has shown the opposite to be true that something could be done to resist the nazis it is tragic that the example did not catch on
i ve watched this documentary twice and although i m an major movie buff most documentaries don t hold my attention this film however was mesmerizing almost every shot is perfect saying so much more than an audio commentary which this documentary does not have the concept of this film is amazing i can t praise it enough mardi gras beads who would have thought amazing and excellent choices of interviews film footage of a factory in china the film makes you feel like you are actually there i m political aware and i ve read several books on globalization so there wasn t anything in this film that was a surprise to me however it s made me think so much i wish so much too that this world was a better place a million kudos to the filmmaker and thanks for making this film too i wish everyone could see it
if any show in the last ten years deserves a it is this rare gem it allows us to escape back to a time when things were simpler and more fun filled with heart and laughs this show keeps you laughing through the three decades of difference the furniture was ugly the clothes were colorful and the even the drugs were tolerable the hair was feathered the music was accompanied by roller skates and in the words of merle haggard a joint was a bad place to be take a trip back to the greatest time in american history fall in love with characters and the feel good essence of the small town where people were nicer to each other this classic is on television as much as full house don t miss it and always remember to shake your groove thing
a meteor drops from the sky and reawakens a plesiosaur that long ago used to terrorize the area around crater lake as the monster eats the locals they try and find away of killing the monster recent attempts at sending up old horror and science fiction films like lost skeleton of cadavra and alien trespass are kind of rendered moot when you have films like crater lake monster available for screening it s the sort of film that those films spoof and send up only this is the real deal its everything those films try to be only with out the tongue in cheek and its so much more fun because of it this is a real drive in sort of film that had the unfortunate luck of coming just as star wars changed the way we look at special effects the monster a mix of stop motion and a life size head is a charmingly quaint little beast the filmmakers spoil the audience with frequent shots of the monster and its mayhem sure its clear that its all fake but isn t movies about suspension of disbelief actually i think its about really cool monsters which this has i like this movie in a low budget drive in sort of a way if you want a real authentic drive in monster movie look no farther this would be perfect for a double or triple feature with similar lake monster films boggy creek etc
warning spoilers ahead the writers of this story knew these men very well the actors likewise portrayed them very well the result is that by the end of the film you feel like you re actually watching john lennon and paul mccartney the expected tensions are there especially in the awkward first moments but as the two begin to loosen up the old camaraderie that made the beatles work so well begins to show through the bitterness is still there and interrupts at times but by the time john gets the idea to take lorne michaels up on his offer to pay the beatles the gag sum of to appear on saturday night live the two could be the same boyish pranksters that terrorized liverpool together as teens and survived playing the rough nightclubs of hamburg to rise to superstardom but in the end this wonderful fantasy grounds us gently we are reminded why a beatles reunion was most likely never possible even before lennon s assassination the two driving forces of the group outgrew each other
a wonderfully quirky film with enough twists for a sack of pretzels parker posey plays fay grim as a sexy vulnerable loving mother who may or may not be what she seems the story is very tongue in cheek and the dialog skillfully understated hints of humor and intrigue neither of which overpower the characterization posey pulls off so well the supporting cast is stellar the downside this film needs your full attention almost to the point of stopping the film and taking notes posey has more sex appeal in her lifting of an eyebrow than most actresses have in their entire body she s worth your time even if you don t understand the denouement
i saw this movie yesterday on turner and i was unable to stop watching until it was over even though i sort of could guess what would happen farrell was great in her role and everyone else did a super job some of it seemed to stretch the limits but all in all i loved it if you get the chance to see it please do i actually cried at a few scenes but then i guess if you are a mom you would loretta is beautiful and i was just in astonishment at the very idea of their being unwed moms there it seemed ahead of its time i say watch it if you can and don t listen to criticisms as they say i laughed i cried i thoroughly enjoyed it
amicus made close to a good half dozen of these horror anthologies in the s and this from leading horror scribe robert bloch is one of their best efforts there are four stories all worthwhile but two sweets for the sweet and method for murder distinguish themselves as highly effective journeys into fear in sweets christopher lee plays an impatient widower whose lovely daughter chloe franks becomes resentful of his neglect and brutish intolerance so she sculpts a voodoo doll with which she expresses her distaste for his methods franks is a beautiful figure of mischievous evil and delivers one of the greatest child performances in a horror film since martin stephens in the innocents this installment is directed with great subtlety and the final outrage occurring off screen is a moment of purest horror method of murder is about a horror novelist denholm elliott who is menaced by one of his own creations the creepy dominic this episode is striking for its simplicity and stark terror dominic may or may not be real so director peter duffell has a great time playing with our expectations the brief shots of dominic reflected in a pond or seen as a fleeting phantasm in a meadow are truly haunting the original poster art featuring a skeletal figure clasping a tray holding peter cushing s severed head was a rich enticement for punters fixed on fear
i searched for this movie for years apparently it ain t available here in the states so bought me a copy off ebay four young hunters and three of their girlfriends venture into the woods searching for a bear that apparently has killed several campers what they find is an ex vietnam vet gone crazy he kills some of his victims using a glove with long metal finger nails a la freddy krueger as soon as the night falls one of the girls goes for a walk after a brief argument with her boyfriend she gets killed after one of the group finds her body they all hide in their tents waiting for daylight once the sun comes up all of them try and make it out but fall victim one by one seven bodies not a lot of gore but a couple of good murders especially the girls deaths the guys get killed in somewhat bloodless ways blown up in car shot to death knife through head overall infernal trap is a nice slasher film from the late s nothing new just well acted fast paced and some pretty ladies out of
wealthy psychiatrist lindsay crouse has just published her first novel and is feeling down about her profession feeling that it s hopeless to help her patients a young gambling junkie client asks her to help him pay off his debts if he truly wants to help him get better here she gets involved with joe mantegna to reveal any more of the plot would spoil one hell of a fun movie and house of games may very well be the best con movie i ve seen david mamet wrote and directed this gem that s full of snappy dialogue great one liners and enough twists to keep you guessing til the end crouse is perfect as the uptight psychiatrist needing a change and mantegna tops her as the devilishly sly con man and with the exception of a coincidence in the last quarter of the movie the film is in utter control of it s audience and we are loving the con out of
i know technically this isn t the greatest tv show ever i mean it was shot on video and its limitations show in both the audio and visual aspect of it the acting can at time be also a little crumby but i love this show so much it scared the hell out of me when it first aired in of course it would i was years old but i recently purchased the dvd of the first episodes which unfortunately i hear is now deleted and i also heard warner s aren t going to release any more due to the first dvd s bad sales also the tv show didn t have the same feel as the movies in fact i thought it had a more sinister tone even though the colour palette is similar to nightmare on elm street both that film and the tv show were made the same year this has more of a serious tone whereas the fims were progressively getting more and more sardonic and jokey not a bad thing i like freddy as the clown wise cracker but i think that was the strenght of this tv show you didn t have freddy popping up every minutes cracking a joke before and after he kills somebody in fact this has more of a dream feel to it reinforced by the soft focus of the lense im not sure if its deliberate on the part of the shows creators or just to the limitations of being shot on video i love this show and taken not as a companion piece to the movies can be very enjoyable much better than anything on tv today
man on fire is definitely one of the best drama crime thrillers i have ever seen despite having a slow beginning the story is so amazingly complex and sensitive that it sticks together rather well this is denzel washington s perfect role in which he plays a body guard called creasy that is tormented by his past and is an alcoholic but never gives up on his duty to save his latest prot g e pita dakota fanning plays pita the very smart enthusiastic little girl that loves so many things and acts in a very convincing manner she has a great future ahead of her as i said the story is somewhat complicated in order to fully understand it you must watch it a couple of times this film is made in two parts there s the first hour where everyone is happy nothing s wrong everyone s just living their lives happily until the kidnapping of pita occurs and where creasy is almost killed and then there s the second part the rest of the film where suddenly everything becomes complicated and somewhat gruesome and disturbing when creasy s recovered from his severe injury and starts chasing and killing the numerous criminals and la hermamdad that were responsible for the planning and execution of the kidnapping of pita denzel washington shows us his most up to date acting talents alongside many other talented actors which have a great future ahead of them it is a real shame that this film hasn t been acknowledged enough washington really deserved another oscar for his performance and so did fanning and the director and even maybe the visual effects which were of very high quality if you like excellent slightly deranged suspenseful thrillers this is the one to see the most amazing thing is that elements of this film are actually based on a real story and real characters
two sailors are on leave ladies man joseph brady gene kelly and shy innocent clarence doolittle frank sinatra they meet beautiful susan abbott kathryn grayson and both fall in love with her there s more but you ve probably guessed it the story even for a s musical is ridiculous and everything is so nice and wholesome gets annoying pretty quick also this movie is far too long it s minutes and that s way too much for such a silly story there are also some boring numbers by jose iturbi and his orchestra still this is worth catching when kelly is dancing or sinatra or grayson are singing this becomes magical none of the songs are particularly memorable but sinatra had such a beautiful voice you won t care it s shot in rich technicolor with all the gloss mgm had the acting is ok kelly is fine although seeing him as a ladies man is pushing it and sinatra is just great although seeing him as a shy guy was pushing it too grayson is given nothing to do but she s incredibly beautiful to look at some shots of her literally took my breath away there are plenty of highlights here sinatra and kelly s big dancing and singing number sinatra singing anything grayson s two songs and the justly famous animated sequence in which kelly dances with jerry an animated mouse tom does a funny cameo too also there s little dean stockwell who steals every scene he s in so it s too long and the plot just doesn t hold up but it s still worth catching this was a huge hit in its day
first off i ll be the first to admit that the scarecrow himself is quite a bit over the top a toned down maybe less acrobatic scarecrow would ve made this movie much less cheesy but overall i think it s one of the better b movies tiffany shepis is absolutely wonderful not to mention incredibly beautiful though this movie is missing the all important nude factor there are several other movies at which to view her but here she gets all evil hotness especially towards the end as she s walking away from the engulfed scarecrow also richard elfman does a great job as sheriff and as the drunk boyfriend yes it s a low budget b movie but out of all of them i ve seen this is definitely one of my very top favorites
gespenster question of to be cool in the german cinemathere are not many german films in the last ten years who have made me so interest yes the problem of the most german films are in this film gespenster too he is on some places to uncooked to be good to see special the figure of toni sabine timento is too cool but thats is in german films always so everybody must to learns this coolne is the realism in this films thats difficult to understand but in this case it makes some sense because she steals and she lies she is the kind of girl is better you never love it because you lose it thats not clear for the other girl nina in this film she love her and she would lose her but nina lost everything she will play with soft emotion and a sad feeling there is no way but you must take it said herbert achterbusch for twenty years thats so often the way it goes in german films why nina julia hummer is not inside of the laws of society the is outside and there she have no chance this films tries not on every place to gave her a part inside thats one of the problems the stupid break with conventions the criminal fascination throw it all away and go nowhere but the actress plays this difficult part very interesting on the other side there the parents who are the pendant to the two girls the have a car a hotel suite the have money and live in world with music of the opera but the film stand always in some distance to seem there is no much explaining of them in the center of this film there is one scene you will never forget the two girls got to a casting and there they should say how they find together in this scene toni will lying on she said a fantastic story has nothing to do with her and then nina will say the truth she said it in an introversion way there is no exhibition in it she looks to the bottom and said what will happened for here thats a great moment in the next scene on the party with pictures in red this feeling is going on than toni goes away okay the film will end in the german way of coolne rubbish here the circle of sadness is closing but there was a moment where is happening something else and this moment was important he is more than german coolne and this moments are rare in the german cinema in this time
jag r nyfiken yellow is a lot of fun like at least one other reviewer i was on numerous occasions laughing out loud yellow is energetic playful self aware explorative don t expect bergman here this movie is about a youth in the early to mid s in sweden and about the issues read contradictions that the nation and the world were facing at times yellow appears to be an earnest social political documentary with lena the main character and others interviewing both common people and politicians e g olaf palme at home at other times yellow seems to parody this kind of documentary all the while yellow acts as a personal documentary exploring lena s life her home life her loves her political views her view of herself she is a complete person complex flawed contradictory happy sad curious and placed over all of this is the wonderful additional dimension of the director sj man and his crew documenting themselves documenting lena it is this that for me really gives yellow wings not only do they suddenly appear at some very funny times and in some funny ways reminding the viewer that this is fiction and artifice but their presence is itself another layer of the film they are filming themselves filming themselves i am reminded of a bjork music video with this same quality a music video about the making of a music video ad infinitum with each iteration getting weirder and more cartoonish i think sj man may have had something similar in mind while jag r nyfiken yellow may not be everyone s cup of tea it is certainly intelligent witty refreshing ebullient and authentic
i enjoyed watching this well acted movie very much it was well acted particularly by actress helen hunt and actors steven weber and jeff fahey it was a very interesting movie filled with drama and suspense from the beginning to the very end i reccomend that everyone take the time to watch this made for television movie it is excellent and has great acting
if you are used to seeing gabriel byrne in serious roles such as tom in millers crossing or keaton in the usual suspects i recommend you take a look at this film even if you are not a fan of gabriel byrne in particular all the actors in this film give really great performances if you ve got about eleven bucks that is close to nine quid i say order it online or rent it from you favorite movie rental place guaranteed to make you laugh whether or not you normally like gangster type movies mad dog time trigger happy is one of those movies you never forget and find yourself watching over and over you will talk about it so much your friends will be begging to borrow it
i was pleasantly surprised i quite liked this movie witty writing some inside jokes i got others i didn t maybe due to actors speaking on top of one another great acting notably john cassini great cameos interesting and unique directing i rented it to see jeffrey meek very disappointed he was in it such a short time blink and you ll miss him but found the movie remarkably entertaining i ll actually watch it again before i send back to netflix i think actors and wanna be actors will thoroughly enjoy this movie the ending is somewhat expected but wish they d done something different and more positive too bad the movie wasn t better received except for in the festival market i suggest it to anyone who loves the acting biz
apart from having the longest reign in british history years queen victoria also holds two other distinctions she was apart from our current queen the oldest ever british monarch living to the age of and she was also the youngest ever british as opposed to english or scottish monarch coming to the throne as a girl of eighteen and yet whenever television or the cinema make a programme or film about her they seem far more interested in the older victoria than they do in the young girl the version of victoria with which modern audiences will probably be most familiar is judi dench in mrs brown the young victoria tries to redress the balance by showing us the events surrounding her accession and the early years of her reign it has the rare distinction of being produced by a former royal sarah duchess of york whose daughter princess beatrice makes a brief appearance as an extra there are three main strands to the plot the first concerns the intrigues of victoria s mother the duchess of kent a highly unpopular figure even with her own daughter largely because of the influence of her adviser sir john conroy who was widely rumoured to be her lover according to one unfounded rumour he and not the late duke of kent was victoria s natural father the second strand concerns the growing romance between victoria and her german cousin prince albert and the attempts of king leopold of belgium who was uncle to both of them to influence this romance leopold s hope was to increase the prestige of the house of saxe coburg to which both he and albert belonged the third concerns one of the strangest episodes in british political history the bedchamber crisis of when supporters of the tory party which had traditionally supported a strong monarchy rioted because the young queen was perceived to favour the whig party and their leader lord melbourne even though the whigs had historically supported a quasi republican system of government with the monarch reduced to a figurehead scriptwriter julian fellowes is known for his conservative views and at times i wondered if this may have coloured his treatment of political themes as he seems to lean to the side of the tories the predecessors of the modern conservative party their leader robert peel is shown as statesmanlike and dignified whereas melbourne for all his dash and charm is shown as devious and uninterested in social reform there may be some truth is these characterisations but fellowes glosses over the fact that only a few years earlier the tories had opposed the reform act which ended the corrupt electoral system of rotten boroughs and that they had benefited from william iv s unconstitutional dismissal of a whig administration lessons in dynastic and constitutional history do not always transfer well to the cinema screen and this one contains its share of inaccuracies prince albert for example was not injured in edward oxford s attempt on victoria s life and melbourne in his late fifties at the time of victoria s accession was not as youthful as he is portrayed here by paul bettany king william iv certainly disliked the duchess of kent who was his sister in law but i doubt if he would have gone so far as to bawl abuse at her during a state banquet as he is shown doing here i also failed to understand the significance of the scene in which the duchess and conroy try to force victoria to sign a regency order the duchess s constitutional position was made clear by the regency act which provided that she would become regent if her daughter was still under eighteen at the time of her accession no piece of paper signed by victoria could have altered the provisions of the act there are also occasional infelicities in one early scene we see victoria and albert playing chess while comparing themselves to pawns being moved around a chessboard a metaphor so hackneyed that the whole scene should have come complete with a danger major clich ahead warning yet in spite of scenes like this i came to enjoy the film there were some good performances especially from miranda richardson as the scheming duchess and mark strong as the obnoxious conroy it is visually very attractive being shot in sumptuous style we have come to associate with british historical drama jim broadbent gives an amusing turn as king william although he does occasionally succumb to the temptation of going over the top although not as disastrously over the top as he was in moulin rouge the main reason for the film s success however is the performances of emily blunt and rupert friend as the two young lovers victoria and albert blunt is probably more attractive than victoria was in real life but in her delightful portrayal the queen is no longer the old lady of the popular imagination the black clad widow of windsor who was perpetually not amused but a determined strong minded and loving young woman her love for albert and their happy family life together was one of the main reasons why the monarchy succeeded in reestablishing itself in the affections of the british people with the exception of george iii victoria s hanoverian ancestors had been notoriously lacking in the matrimonial virtues blunt and friend make the young victoria a touching romance and a gripping human drama as well as an exploration of a key period in british history
let s begin with that theme song sung by christopher cross the song is if you get caught between the moon and new york city it s a great theme and song even after all these years it never gets tiring it really is a great song about new york city as well anyway the great dudley moore cbe stars as a spoiled drunken millionaire who is engaged to jill eikenberry s character in the film jill would later star on la law anyway he is served by his wonderful british butler sir john gielgud om who won an academy award for his performance in the film as best supporting actor arthur falls in love with liza minnelli s character who is perfect in this film besides her performance in her oscar winning role in cabaret no liza doesn t get to sing she plays a diner waitress anyway i love geraldine fitzgerald as the bach matriarch of the family who decides the family s fortune anyway she is fabulous and should have gotten an academy award nomination herself for best supporting actress barney martin best known as jerry s dad on seinfeld plays liza s dad he s great too the movie was well written acted and delivered to the audience who wanted more of it
i saw this film premiere friday night in park city for sundance and was incredibly moved sitting in a theater and hearing first hand the anguish soldiers go through was almost more than i could bear others in the audience were equally moved and while we wanted to turn away the least we could do was bear witness as these men and women shared their experience with us robert acosta paul rieckhoff sean huze and herold noel all veterans of the war in iraq and featured in the film were present while they may be home now you can tell this war is still inside them and probably always will be whether you support the war or not it is our duty to support the troops with something other than a bumper sticker see this film
this movie is the only movie to feature a scene in which michael jackson wields a tommy gun plain and simple this movie rocks because it is freaking hilarious it may be creepy to see jacko w little kids but this movie also stars wait for it joe pesci think about it joe pesci and jacko with tommy guns throwing coins into jukeboxes from feet away whats not to like as stated before this movie rocks
no this isn t a sequel to the fabulous ova series but rather a remake of the events that occurred after the death of ghim and the disappearance of woodchuck it is also more accurate to the novels that inspired this wonderful series which is why characters namely orson and shiris are reintroduced and why the story may seem slightly different to those used to the ova the booklet included in the set provides excellent answers to such questions as do various online sites the first eight episodes of this part tv series focus on the fateful battle at demon dragon mountain the remaining episodes introduce us to spark a blue haired knight wannabe who identifies with parn and his ragtag team of misfits as they attempt to stop the dark wizard wagnard from resurrecting kardis the destroyer while it isn t quite the equivalent of the original lodoss war we all love the finale where parn saves deedlit from wagnard don t we this tv follow up is still great fun for fantasy fans even if the animation is limited and a step down from the artistic streak of the first lodoss this part series has its elements of appeal the fully realized characters engaging storyline magic romance and a superb soundtrack scored by kaoru wada of ninja scroll all give this uneven spin off some punch while the ova dub of lodoss has been criticized for one reason or another i generally liked it and still consider it one of my favorite dubs so i had significant hopes for the dub for chronicles made in for the most part the lodoss tv english track is of passable if not stellar quality it does however have its share of problems much of the original cast who lent their english voices to the characters of lodoss return including lisa ortiz as deedlit which is a nice bonus on the other hand billy regan s more mature sounding parn is a bit offputting he doesn t do a bad job but his voice came across as grating for the first eight episodes causing some anti dub fans to instantly diss the dub but by the time spark and company take the stage i found it less bothersome i don t know if it s because he improved or if it just grew on me also not everyone from the oav dub returns jayce reeves only voices wagnard terrifically for one episode he s replaced by pete zarustica for the whole show who gives a scratchy but still malevolent turn as well as the expected evil laughter anthony cruise s kashue on the other hand is too weary and takes about five or so episodes to find his stride oliver gregory is probably the most effective as orson especially during his final dramatic scenes aside from lisa ortiz deedlit karen smith shiris john knox ashram and al muscari slayn the dub s best voices come from some of the newer characters including crispin freeman spark maar garrack episodes roxanne beck little neese meg frances who voices pirotess in the oav but also voices ryna with vulnerability and sassiness as well as karla and especially angora deb who steals every scene she s in as leaf the half elf the rest of the cast isn t terrible by any means but a little more uneven than the oav dub some are all right aldonova greevus while others are lackluster hobb palace guards dragons etc and few were awful in particular prince reona s va is too harsh and monotone for a fighter of justice in fact the lack of aural continuity some cast members get new voices for some unexplained reason by the time we get to some of the later episodes is one of the problems of the dub others include less memorable and more awkward sounding dialogue uneven synchronization and finally i apologize in advance to the fans of this the lodoss island segments these offbeat super deformed interludes at the end of each episode will either amuse or drive you batty admittingly i at first found them to be a major nuisance but they sorta grew on me after a while besides there are some showstoppingly hilarious lines such as i m king kashue and this is my cashew i m really quite a nut these flaws rank the dub for chronicles just a notch just below that for the ova resulting in an uneven english track summed up best as ok if one wonders if the japanese language track is the preferred listening choice well guess what the japanese version has its good and bad points too while some voices are less annoying than the english language track i found others to be less appealing than the english equivalents in particular the actress who does deedlit is nowhere nearly as good as lisa ortiz or yumi tohma plus i should mention that the japanese cast is not the same as the ova because the series was made seven years after the original all but one sho hayami of the cast members are replaced by new ones although they do a respectably good job it may be a major annoyance for those who were used to the japanese ova cast shows that not everything in japanese is better than english eh despite its flaws chronicles of the heroic knight is still a fine series which deserves to hold its own ground its not without its rough spots and doesn t always live up to its predecessor yet there s enough good points to counter the bad making this a moderately enjoyable fantasy anime
david zucker has directed one of the most enjoyable comedies of the year with this goofy farce yes it s a matter of acquired taste and depends upon a wealth of sophomoric gags but it is consistently funny throughout unlike some recent comedic efforts the film is loaded with all kinds of jokes ranging from the blatantly obvious to the more subtler kind that you must pay attention to everything in the frame or you ll likely miss them like his previous efforts which include airplane top secret and naked gun the humor flies out almost every second there are so many moments that work it s easy to overlook the few that fall flat what sets this movie apart from other pale imitations in the spoof genre is that it has an actual story line while others have depended upon making fun of too many famous scenes in almost random movies take mafia please this film tells a new story with likable characters it touches upon sports films in general as well as satirizing the real sports industry instead of lampooning any specific movies even for people who don t care for south park its creators matt stone and trey parker make a good pair of leading actors with natural chemistry the film also makes extremely effective use of cameos of athletes sports announcers and other celebrities especially a hilarious bit with robert stack of unsolved mysteries by the way stay through the credits for a final joke with bob costas and al michaels all in all zucker has achieved in words perhaps applying to the movie s mix of sports a home dunk
very interesting the big twist wasn t as big a shock as maybe they had hoped for and it was very dated but it did get my mind working it really got me thinking about a world without vegetation or livestock and made me appreciate the world i live in a lot more charlton heston does a good job as do all the supporting characters and it was a very realistic film which was surprising it lacked direction at times and a lot of the settings and background needed more explanation but it was still a surprisingly good and intelligent movie the main fault that i could find was that i didn t want the film to end when it did i would have liked to see what happened next
this is a good example a film that in spite of the low rating is more than worth watching the story is engaging and it doesn t take long before the chemistry between nicole kidman and ben chaplin grabs your attention the acting is first class and the characters are represented well sometimes it feels like the director couldn t decide himself between drama and romantic comedy ben chiller s portrayal of the law abiding and shy englishman with porn s m magazines hidden in the bedroom creates plenty of moments for laughs as does the look in nicole kidman s eyes when she is offering john his first taste of intimacy in a long time other times the actors and especially nicole kidman give this comedy quite expertly a dramatic slant
so i consider myself pretty big into the anime scene with very few shows i simply will not watch this show however i would recommend to anyone quite possibly the most original series to date it s got just about everything i could ask for a side story so to speak about an unconditional love that will not be admitted to a very blatant comedy and a very well put together voice acting cast both japanese and american translation if not for the terribly funny aspect to it it would be just another anime more or less as i have noticed a love it or hate it very few people i have seen introduced to this series will end up with a distaste for it original to the core with everything you could ask for in an afternoon bet the house on this series i m ready to assure you that you will enjoy it
this is very nearly a perfect film the ideas would be repeated by mamet but never told so succinctly this is really about the failure of trust of the human condition the film weaves the idea that we are all criminals no one is innocent is there anyone alive today who hasn t seen this play out in our own society every single day the film is very much structured like a hitchcock thriller except there are no more innocent characters the world is now completely polluted ruined and everyone is participating in the con could anything be more true don t miss the soundtrack it is wonderful
it was on at am too close to school to see very often the animation computer graphics were spectacular for the time the idea of cowboys ordinary people casually throwing around space vehicles robots was amazing maybe it inspired treasure planet unfortunately it s really boring in the dvd format the shows are all basically identical when viewing non sequential episodes on a dvd you re stoned by disk by today s standards the animation is spotty we don t notice the computer graphics anymore and focus on how corny the characters are instead the bright spots are the heroine characters they were a lot more believable took themselves more seriously than modern heroines and weren t corny they actually saved men
i saw the movie and really could not stop my tears its tragedy that india has no such leaders after freedom who dare to do justice with their own children when they don t behave properly in current generation politicians bring their children s into politics without measuring their caliber and skills i remember the dialogue from gandhi what kind of society we want to create make with such people about harilal no wonder that it will be a dream that india will hardly have such leader in this or next generation einstein was right when he said about gandhi that after years one would hardly believe that such person with body soul and mind mahatma gandhi had ever lived on this earth i sincerely want to thanks a lot to anil kapoor feroze khan and all film actors actresses for this wonderful movie about great person and relationship with his son all father and son should watch this movie once and take some lessons for both roles
the fox and the child is the latest film from march of the penguins filmmaker frenchman luc jacquet the movie which boasts just one human being in its cast young actress bertille no l bruneau tells the story of the rather rare though seemingly believable relationship between a child and a wild fox part nature documentary and part fairy tale the film focuses on l infant the child who on her way to school one day comes across the path of a wild fox in a picturesque setting possibly france though the exact location is never mentioned over the coming weeks the child revisits the place where she found her fox hopeful that one of said days she will see said fox who she begins to call lily once again and so it goes on days turn to weeks and then the summer disappears turning to fall and then winter promting some superb cinematography of the sweeping white winter landscape eventually spring comes around again and the young child finds her fox and indeed does strike up a friendship with the animal and so on i had little to no expectation for the fox and the child i had seen march of the penguins and was simply in awe at the film making contained in that movie luc jacquet is a hugely talented and indeed rare film maker and i was expecting some superb breathtaking cinematography sweeping vistas and brilliant footage of the wildlife this was delivered in spades but here jacquet has a screen writing credit and not knowing anything about the movie prior to the screening i expected something a little different than what had previously been seen in march a fictional story the child and the fox and the story is simple a young seemingly lonely child lives in a house in the middle of nowhere and walks to school seemingly on her own every day seemingly without a care in the a seemingly perfect world without the hint of an adult in sight brilliant so she strikes up a friendship with a fox with a film like this you have to dismiss your own opinion of the movie and put yourselves in the shoes of the target audience this is a film which is aimed directly at children from the age of i d say six and up or to families who fancy a trip to the cinema with their breed one wet sunday afternoon not a year old male who gets his kicks from films like the recent brilliant wanted and the like but me being the newbie london critic i put myself in the shoes of an excited eight year old girl for the or so minutes of the fox and the child now i have a few problems with this film as a year old lad and loyal lover of all things cinematic i loved the wildlife and landscape photography it s visually stunning the direction of the animal characters is brilliantly executed as good as you will find on any of attenborough s efforts as an impressionable short attention spanning eight year old i loved about the first half hour then i lost interest it s a little repetitive and in places quite harrowing and bloody scary for a younger child particularly the rather dark ending as a year old male i was a little frightened in places wuss so it s not a child s film it s not really an adult film and i felt a little let down is it a good family film depends it s educational maybe and the film carries a message it s definitely not a film i would pay the hard earned green to go see and i m racking my brains to try and recommend it to a certain type of film goer it s hard but i know some will go see and fall in love this film it s very european in feel and certainly if you are a fan of wildlife themed flicks give it a try unsure well i d wait for the dvd for a wet sunday afternoon in then paul heath http www thehollywoodnews com july
this has just been broadcast on bbc and i am absolutely delighted to have seen it as the credits rolled the cast alone made certain that i would give it a go after just five minutes i was completely immersed in this beautiful film yes it was formulaic and predictable but that somehow added to it s charm the flashbacks to the forties were wonderfully placed and captured a feeling equalled in few productions a real feel good film punctuated throughout with outstanding music when it s released i ll buy it
this is really a great unknown movie perfect dialogue without the typical clich s this movie relied on the actor s talent and it was pulled off it even had a little bit a comedy in it but it wasn t overdone once in the life is what a crime drama is supposed to be not the typical special affects garbage with sex thrown in i especially loved the interracial aspects of it all now onto the actors themselves laurence fishburne was superb at playing a career petty criminal it s a shame that he s only allowed to show his talent in his own movie titus welliver was fabulous as fishburne s junky half brother eamonn walker added flavor to the already perfectly spiced film paul calderon was perfect as a grease monkey drug lord i loved his acting since king of new york but the best acting in this film came from gregory hines and michael paul chan who were paired perfectly as two of calderon s henchmen once in the life is for sure a keeper out of
basically this movie is one of those rare movies you either hate and think borders on suicide as the next best thing to do rather than having to sit through it for two hours or as in my case you see it as a kult hit one of those movies wherein the humour the plot the acting is actually very hidden but for those of us willing to go looking for it trusting the director well the reward is u laugh your a of the fact that u have to find the things mentioned above actually makes the movie even more funny because u get the impression the director isn t even aware of how funny his movie is which doesn t seem likely and therein lies the intelligence at the helm of this magnificient project called spaced invaders
once in a while you come upon a movie that defines your values and shows you the true depth of human emotions leaving you drained vivah is just that maybe more after watching ddlj saajan and lamhey i really thought that bollywood has reached its pinnacle and will never come up with anything like that ever boy was i wrong i went to the store to buy some groceries and decided to pick this movie up along with the new don just so i can compare the great ab with shahrukh although the decision is already made in my mind after debating whether i should waste almost hours on a meaningless movie i decided to watch it realizing i had nothing else to do when i saw the rating of u instead of an a i was happy that at least it is something where i don t have to watch scantily clad women with bad acting skills doing nothing but dancing on every opportunity they get and making out with every guy to show that they have more skills in bed than a hollywood b actress for the first minutes or so i thought i would again be subjected to meaningless story with bad acting after all everyone who has seen shahid kapor know that he as never gained his fame as an accomplished actor boy was i wrong about this movie this movie grabbed my interest after the first minutes and would never let it go it was a great movie with a good storyline about the vanishing traditions of our society i liked not only that the director was brave enough to make a movie where younger generation might not relate to the concept of arranged marriage but also that he did it with a conviction that it is the right thing to do i have no idea why some people think that the acting was not good i felt that the acting was great and even though the music score might not be considered the best ever it was still very very good the good thing is this music will grow on people with time like it did with me after the i watched that movie a second time the other good thing is that thee songs are not pushed into the script as we have all seen in so many movies these songs actually tell a big part of the story and are certainly a welcome addition just like ajay devgan went from being a joke to a great actor after company and salman found his groove after hum aapkey hain kaun this movie will help shahid kappor jump to being of the better actors and entertainers in bollywood this is the first movie of his in which i like him and his role he acted well and adjusted to being the nice good looking young rich kid yes you will not find him playing basketball and scoring every point on a dunk like you saw shahrukh in ddlj even though he is shown to be an indian in england both countries not big on basketball by the way he does come across as very believable as a person who holds true to his values amrita rao for the first time came across as someone to be remembered in all her other movies she was competing with big faces which was actually hindering her no one knew how good of an actress she really is until they watch this movie some of the scenes in which she has to cry especially towards the end really shows her knowledge and depth of acting although she has been in another movies she is most memorable in this one i think this movie will and should do wonders for her move over rani there is finally another girl who if given a decent chance to work with good directors can grab the torch from you she is beautiful with a great voice and has a face that exudes complete innocence oh having almost body fat does not hurt either yes people i will challenge you find even fat on her and unlike so many others like sonali she can actually act too i thought i will never be enamored by anyone s beauty after madhuri and early kajol but she completely changed that shahid and amrita worked very well together and their relationship fitted their characters and they both did an excellent job although i was waiting for shahid to turn into a girl like salman did every time he uttered hum aapkey hain kaun when i finished watching this movie it left me so emotionally drained that i decided to watch this movie again right away yes right away i have never ever done that not even with ddlj but this movie just had something that had to be understood again and again i will probably watch this movie a third time over the weekend just so i can watch and relive the traditions we all grew up with i miss those times where families sat down and had fun when parents had time for their kids and where kids respected what their parents believed in i know a lot of people think that movie does not portray real life but deep down don t we all want it to happen the families thee tradition the love and respect this is what this movie will remind all of us of i can assure you it is an extremely well made movie which you will enjoy i am sure some young people will not like this movie but if you are over i doubt that you will be one of them
i saw saving grace right after it came out on video since then it s become one of my favorites the plot isn t particularly complex but it doesn t take away from the entertainment it s chuck full of comedic moments and has a very endearing quality to it the characters are what makes the movie so good they each have their own quirky qualities which adds to the humor the two old ladies played by linda kerr scott and phyllida law leaps to mind superb acting was done by all particularly brenda blythen she and craig ferguson were great together in pulling off some of the funnier moments if you re looking for a good comedy i d definately recommend this movie

make the world go away get it off my shoulder say the things you used to say and make the world go away well dave david hewlett and andrew andrew miller were in a pickle one for embezzlement and the other for kissing a child neither was guilty but faced with charges and their house about to be torn down they ended up in well nothing the whole world except for their house went away it is kind of weird but funny too just what would you do if you were all alone in the world the two friends just enjoy each other s company and do what they want but that gets old fast it seems then they start to improve their live by hating away memories the sound effects during this were great things really got weird at the end this film was the product of a great imagination and written and directed by vincenzo natali with help from the two stars it just has to be seen
i m not sure i understand where all these enthusiastically anti grudge people are talking about here perhaps it s just that some people like to rant about things the movie was certainly imperfect uneven acting some may have had difficulties with the time changes actors all too willing to go places i d really rather not go etc but imho there were some things that more than made up for the imperfections first and foremost i loved the breaking of the rules bit normally when you leave the haunted house the baddies leave you alone giving you time to regroup get friends and find the token mysterious paranormal type normally semi spoiler alert when you re hiding under the covers they can only get you through that little opening you peek through normally at the end the ghosts somehow have become less creepy because you ve found out they re just misunderstood or they ve been freed or whatever secondly the production was exceptional while the movie was hardly special effects laden the supernatural bits while brief were extremely well done probably not the best sort of movie for those who think freddy and jason are the ultimate sort of horror nothing against em they ve got their place but great for those who ve begun to take the conventions for granted and who don t have trouble with the time distortions
the perfect space fantasy film a group of kids go up accidentally in space and have to get back down but do they sure they do this would not be a family film if they all died then it will all be sad you don t want that kate capsaw the leading lady gives a golden globe performance but sadly she nor lea thompson won one that sucks so bad i can t say it enough this film is so great lea thompson o lord a perfect girl for this film this film is the best for sure sorry but better than star wars star wars is so over rated and space camp was so under rated it should of been the other way aroundexcellent r maybe iam not good at math
the house that dripped blood is the third in a series of seven amicus horror anthologies if the monster club is included as part of the series this would make eight movies although that movie is very different from the others i look upon the amicus anthologies with great memories as i used to love them when i was in my teens my feelings for them today are just as strong i spent many years trying to track down this movie the synopses of the stories was so appealing that i went as far as paying a substantial amount for it when i eventually found a copy as great as though the movie is i did feel a sense of disappointment when i finally saw it it wasn t quite as good as i was led to believe whilst better than its two predecessors it s nowhere near as good as its four successors as i shall demonstrate the linking story sees john bennett as a police inspector tracking down a missing person who lives in a mysterious old house his journey begins at the local police station where he learns the stories of previous occupants the linking story later sees him visiting the estate agent who sold the house whilst this linking story seems enticing on paper it is flat and lifeless in practice and easily the weakest of any amicus anthology i couldn t help but get the feeling that john bennett is a poor man s version of donald pleasance or ian hendry i would much rather have seen one of the two aforementioned actors in his role we could have even had both here one as the police inspector and another as the estate agent they could and i believe would have brought this weak element of the movie to life much better the movie contains four stories each of which focuses on an inhabitant of the house the first story sees denholm elliott as a writer of crime stories he is absorbed into an exciting story about a strangler even going as far as drawing a sketch to aid his writing soon after he begins seeing visions of his own creation some excellent direction by peter duffell particularly with the choice of camera angles helps to detract from the restrained script elliott s performance is superb as the tormented writer and he also helps to elevate the story the story ends with a semi twist but i couldn t help get the sense of a script which didn t allow it to live up to its potential the second story sees peter cushing move into the house he is a lonely man who is still pining for a beautiful young woman who once jilted him and who he keeps a picture of cushing s performance really brings this emotionally moving story to life he is helped by the director who chooses to include continual focus on cushing s loneliness this is taken further with a great hallucination scene that helps us to see inside cushing s mind anyway cushing sees a figure at a nearby wax museum that looks just like his girl naturally his obsession grows but this seemingly romantic story has a disturbing twist at the end joss ackland plays cushing s rival but his performance is massively overshadowed by the late great peter cushing the third story and easily the best sees christopher lee my favourite horror actor of all time move into the house with his daughter mr lee gives one his perfect ice cold performances here he shows no love or attention for his daughter at all he even brings in a school governess to educate her the governess played by nyree dawn porter in another of her superb performances tries to find out what is wrong without giving too much away i can reveal that witchcraft plays a role christopher lee s presence is truly electrifying in every scene he s in chloe franks deserves special recognition for her massively underrated performance as the little girl who is easily the creepiest character in the whole movie the movie is worth seeing even for the sake of seeing just this one story the final story is played almost entirely for laughs but it certainly does entertain and that s what matters jon pertwee plays a horror movie actor who moves into the house he is very dissatisfied at the approach his producers take to movies seeing everything as cheap and fake particularly the costumes so he decides to buy an authentic cloak for his latest vampire role geoffrey bayldon has an excellent cameo as a dealer who sells pertwee an ancient cloak when pertwee puts the cloak on he starts developing fangs and basically transforming into a vampire pertwee s performance has to be seen to be believed it truly is hilarious ingrid pitt is also in this story but her talent is wasted in a role that should have been much larger the linking story finishes with a loose connection to the final story this is particularly fitting since the inspector was looking for pertwee and naturally decides to visit the house the rest you ll be able to work out for yourself as weak as the linking story is it does have a decent if somewhat unintentionally comical ending i m convinced that the blame for the shortcomings in what should have been a truly magnificent movie doesn t lie with peter duffell the director who really does his best with what he s got i think the script was just too restrained and lacking the ambition that can be found in the four later movies overall the house that dripped blood despite its flaws is a must see for fans of the amicus anthologies fans of other amicus movies or fans of portmanteau horror movies if my summary provides the movie with enough appeal in your eyes check it out you ll enjoy it
i saw this film and heard the writer director juan gerard speak at the santa barbara int l film festival all i knew about it was that it was the story of an year old boy at the time of the cuban revolution in and how it affects his home and family its opening scene will bring to mind cinema paradiso in fact the film is filled with references to classic films the roulette wheel casablanca chicken clucking rebel without a cause references to bunuel touch of evil you ll find more the homeless man georg stanford brown is a reference to cuban folklore which often uses a black man as a type of greek chorus what this film really is is the culmination of a dream gerard s wish to honor his family and medium of film that he has loved all of his life this is the true story of juan gerard and all the people in it are real as are the events depicted gerard is actually an architect and engineer and passionate film lover but his dream was to make this movie he and his wife decided to live that dream and harvey keitel became an angel who believed in gerard and agreed to produce and star in it keitel holds the screen powerfully as the mysterious and secretive grandfather che brown and keitel are the only americans in the cast iben hjejle high fidelity and gael garcia bernal y tu mama tambien offer strong support in key roles truthfully the first half of the film suffers from stiff delivery of lines and some overracting but stay with it the last half is much better as the events of the revolution combine for the bittersweet and honest climax it is the first effort of juan gerard but it is honest as he is and his passion and heart really come through in this sincere first effort i would definitely see it again and hope that he continues his film career
after you ve seen this small likable and comical film you will for sure feel better cheer to yves b pelletier to have given birth to this small magnificent movie moment that according to me will be recognized as a marking movie of year for the quebec the actors isabelle blais emmanuel bilodeau sylvie moreau and st phane gagnon all deliver a touching performance i would compare the feeling that this wonderful story gives you to the ones that le fabuleux destin d am lie poulain have given me so if you ve like the jean pierre jeunet magnificent film i would say that you should also like the first movie from yves b pelletier les aimants
we re a long way from laura once again otto preminger directs dana andrews stars as a police detective named mark and gene tierney is the beautiful woman who haunts him but nothing else about where the sidewalk ends resembles everyone s favorite sophisticated murder mystery instead of deliciously quotable dialogue we get gritty harrowing realism while the earlier film took place in the ritzy upper echelons of new york society here we re in the low rent district of dark streets hoodlums cheap restaurants and crummy flats tierney gorgeous as ever now works as a department store mannequin and lives in washington heights the neighborhood of the doll who once got a fox fur out of laura s mark mcpherson this time andrews is mark dixon an older sadder more troubled version of the cool cop in a trench coat where the sidewalk ends belongs to a sub genre of noir movies about police brutality focusing on cops who can t control their violent impulses like kirk douglas s character in detective story dixon owes his seething contempt for crooks to his father s criminal past where douglas is self righteous and blind to his own faults andrews is burdened by repressed guilt and self loathing he accidentally kills a suspect and covers up his actions with an attempt to throw suspicion on a slimy gangster gary merrill whom he has been vainly pursuing for years instead a kindly cab driver is suspected because he s the father of the dead man s estranged and mistreated wife morgan gene tierney dixon falling in love with the wife of the man he killed tries desperately to save her father without giving himself away among noir protagonists dana andrews had this distinction he was incapable of appearing unintelligent even when playing an average joe as he usually did he always comes across as unusually sensitive and perceptive more than that his air of being too thoughtful for his own comfort gives him that haunted and haunting quality that was his essence as an actor he played ordinary guys cops and soldiers but always with a tragic undercurrent of seeing and knowing too much his conscientious heroes are marked by exhaustion guilt the inability ever to lighten up no other actor could have expressed so well the bottled up anger the slow burning pain the agonized intelligence of mark dixon he also has a muted tenderness a muffled warmth and even wry humor that make him heartbreaking this comes out when he takes morgan to a restaurant where he s a regular and for the first time we see this cold brutal man trading mock insults with the waitress whose sarcasm can t hide her affection and concern for him when dixon asks his partner for money to get a lawyer for morgan s father he supplies it even though they recently argued and dixon threw a punch at him there are no words about loyalty or knowing he s a good guy deep down but we see it all in the man s anguished silence and his wife s resignation as she hands over some jewelry to pawn dixon s goodness comes across through other people s reactions to him as much as through andrews s deeply moving performance though dana andrews was a minor star he may be the quintessential forties man he goes through some movies hardly ever taking off his overcoat with that boxy mid century silhouette further fortified by the fedora the glass of bourbon the cigarette he doesn t take out of his mouth when he talks he looks imprisoned in the masculine ideal of toughness and impassivity while many noirs romanticize the two fisted tough guy where the sidewalk ends offers an unflinching portrait of the reality behind the fa ade a gripping and melancholy exploration of the roots and consequences of violence andrews was sadly underrated in his own time he was the only one of the three protagonists in the best years of our lives not nominated for an academy award though his low key performance is far more compelling than frederic march s hammy oscar winning drunk fortunately andrews appeared in some films that ensured his immortality and now at last this little known film which contains his best performance can be seen as part of the marvelous fox film noir set this series including a number of never before released titles such as nightmare alley and thieves highway suggests that twentieth century fox may have had the finest record of all the major studios when it came to film noir
kim basinger stars as della a housewife who has twin children terri and tammi played by luke gair and erika shaye gair and an abusive jerk for a husband kenneth played by craig sheffer the movie opens on christmas eve kenneth is on his way home from work driving a nice car too i might add he is on his cellphone arguing with a business partner i would assume when he gets home he sees that the floor is a mess with shoes and toys spread all about this angers him even more and he takes up with his wife della asking her why the house is always a mess he pins her up against the wall the twin s watch from the stairs he punches the wall leaving a hole in it and walks away she tends to the children trying to comfort them after that is all said in done she needs to go to the mall to do some last minute shopping and because she is out of wrapping paper she gets there and the parking lot is full because there is a lot of last minute shoppers there while she is looking for a parking space she notices a car taking up two spaces and this irks her she finally finds a spot to park makes her way over to the hoggish car and leaves a note under the wiper calling the owner a selfish jerk then she goes in the mall to do her last minute shopping when she finally does leave the mall it is closing and many people have left already not the owner of the car she left the note on however and she notices this on the way to her vehicle she also notices that the note she left under the wiper is no longer there odd when she gets to her vehicle she gets in to start it up she notices a car coming up behind her and it blocks her from backing up she gets out of the car only to be confronted by the owner of the car chuckie played by lukas haas she left the note on and a posse of his thug friends yelling ensues and a mall cop no not paul blart makes his way over to them to see what the problem is only to have his brains blown out of his head by chuckie while this happens della jumps in her vehicle starts it and drives over the median in front of her chuckie and his posse hop in his car and give chase della ends up crashing her vehicle into a log pile at a housing development but she is unharmed she manages to make it to the back of her vehicle open up the hatchback and grab a toolbox before the thugs get there with that della spends the rest of the night trying to outrun and out wit the thugs armed with only the tools that she has in her toolbox as weapons the first kill in my opinion is the best the first kill that della performs anyway the last one was probably the weakest and it should of been the best considering that this was the main bad guy she was offing i will admit that there will be some that are put off buy the ending and i was let down a bit myself as a whole though it was a fun flick and moves along nicely at it s hour and minute run time
i simply love this movie it is a perfect example of the well rounded surprising stories that come out of asian cinema there was a recent hollywood remake of this movie with richard gere and the simply awful jennifer lopez please do not confuse the two movies the original japanese film is touching subtle and wonderfully acted the hollywood version is the exact opposite i was aghast when i first saw the trailer for the remade us version and who was starring in it it s typical hollywood unoriginal crass commercialism at it s worst the remake cements the argument that some foreign films can never be improved upon the only reason the original film did not become more widely viewed is the us audience s aversion to subtitles one of the main reasons this movie would never work in an american telling is that the reserved ultra socially conservative character of the public japanese persona is at issue in this movie certainly the main character awakens to a more full understanding of living a vivacious life through dance but half of the movie s tension comes from the stereotypes and ridicule ballroom dancers face in japan please try to see this movie in it s original form not the terrible full screen and please do skip the us remake it s a shallow travesty in comparison to the original japanese movie yes i know the original movie is much older and this is simply a japanese take on the story but the only two people are likely to see any time soon are this one and the new us remake speaking of foreign films i ll make a few quick recommendations monsoon wedding i list this first for a reason outstanding film johnny stechino very funny italian mistaken identity flic shiri a korean action pic that mixes both asian flare us style plot run lola run a german film that integrates it s techno score ingeniously well just a quick list anyway
i m tired of people judging films on their historical accuracy it s a movie people the writers and directors are supposed to put their own spin into the story there are a number of movies out there that aren t entirely accurate with the history braveheart wyatt earp gangs of new york geronimo an american legend the last of the mohicans all fantastic films that are mildly inaccurate historically if you want to see a few great actors do what they do best then i suggest you see this film and don t worry about the accuracy of the facts just enjoy the quality of the film the storyline and one of the greatest actors of our time
wow what a movie i m not at all a fan of contemporary italian directors usually i don t like dramas i am not a will smith super fan even thinking that he is a very good actor but this movie it is such a great movie with a such original script and so good direction and so well acting wow it is stunning this movie captured my attention minute by minute and i even did not like the pursuit of happiness maybe also because i did not like the acting of will s son who is a very bad actor while children usually seems all natural born actors i saw him also last night in the day the earth stood still and i confirmed my sensation that jaden can t act i don t want to write spoilers and so i don t talk about the story but what i can say is that this movie talks about love death and other feelings which i don t like to watch in movies but this movie is such a super great movie if you have a minimum of heart you ll don t regret watching it
i loved this movie i knew it would be chocked full of camp and silliness like the original series i found it very heart warming to see adam west burt ward frank gorshin and julie newmar all back together once again anyone who loved the batman series from the s should have enjoyed return to the batcave you could tell the actors had a lot of fun making this film especially adam west and i ll bet he would have gladly jumped back into his batman costume had the script required him to do so i told a number of friends about this movie who chose not to view it now they wished they had i have all of the original episodes on vhs now this movie will join my collection thank you for the reunion adam and burt
i saw the latter half of this movie about a year ago and was very happy to finally find it available on dvd recently i watched several of the reality series on pbs about ranching etc none of them came as close to telling the story as this movie does based on real reality pulling no punches bleak happy tragic and enlightening this is a movie that should be shown to students or to anyone interested in early frontier life fine acting on the part of both rip torn and conchata ferrell add to an well done script the opening credit states that it was done though funds supplied through the national endowment for the humanities if this is the kind of product taxes could go to i would be happy to see more i highly recommend it and would encourage people to tell a friend if you have seen it and enjoyed the film
i remembered this as being one of my favorite books as a child and had been wanting to read it to my year old daughter for a while now i knew the movie was coming out soon so we went to the library to get the book and they gave us preview passes for the next day we rushed home and spent the afternoon reading the book so we could compare wasn t necessary the only thing in common between the book and the movie is the main characters first name the fact that there is a bet and a whole lot of worm eating oh yeah i almost forgot the kid who cooks most of the worms likes to present his masterpieces with a french accent how the kids know each other the number of kids involved how the bet came about the number of worms that must be eaten the time frame in which he has to eat the worms how they are cooked progression of friendships climax scenes etc nothing is the same but somehow it did not ruin the movie for me the characters are all enjoyable and the film did not leave me disappointed word of caution for parents there was one moment when you could hear the adults in the room collectively draw their breath and that was when billy s little brother referred to his penis as a dilly dick the embarrassing part came when my daughter proceeded to ask those sitting around us does anybody know what a dilly dick is lol that and an occasional shut up is as foul mouthed as this film gets my daughter thought she might get sick around worm and and was holding the empty nacho container just in case but was fine by worm she and i both really enjoyed the film and had a wonderful time sharing the experience
if i watch a movie and don t once look at my watch or clock to see how much longer it will be running or when i hope that the last scene wasn t the end of the movie it s got to be pretty good i m not an movie internalist or cinema dissectionist i watch movies and if they keep me interested till the end then they are pretty good because some of the most critically acclaimed films bore me to death the english patient shakespeare in love atonement crash this movie kept me interested and absorbed beginning to end acting is great story is absolutely original flash back technique very affective there was a bit of citizen kane thrown in tho when hoffman trashes his apartment after tomei leaves him but i forgive that cause i see it as a homage to rather than a rip off of orson
it was an excellent piece to the puppet series because this film showed all of the series from one to seven and this was about one woman trying to stop the new puppet master because i would have never guessed that the puppets would be in pain plus it showed some of the puppet master series that i didn t see and i what to see it so badly like part two it showed an appearance of torch which can turn things and humans which is cool and showed the return of the puppet master from part one it also showed little aliens from part that was also cool it showed other people episodes that might be good to them and it did so thanks to this puppet master is going to be a big hit
man on fire was hot i love a classic tale of good ol revenge and what better cause for revenge than the kidnapping of an innocent little girl the writers did an excellent job in this movie of building the relationship between creasy denzel washington and pita dakota fanning so that the viewer would understand and actually feel the drive creasy had to rescue pita it was also good that creasy wasn t a choir boy type trying to rescue pita through the proper channels but instead used torture tactics and street smarts some may say torture is wrong regardless and you may be right but when you see the pain creasy goes through due to the loss of pita and the sheer passion he has for getting her back you can t help but side with creasy and pull for him to be even more merciless there would be no progress if creasy used diplomacy to deal with the different nefarious gangsters and criminals and he knew that creasy s quest ended with the return of pita to her mother and creasy dying in the vehicle of the bad guys but creasy s death did not diminish the effectiveness of the movie it in fact enhanced it by showing that creasy was willing to die to get pita back his death was noble in fact denzel does an excellent job as do the writers this movie deserves good marks because it definitely was a good movie
i saw this movie in my childhood and after years i did not remember anything about this movie but i found out it i also don t know how i was able to find out this movie its my life my all times favorite movie my words will fall short of true meaning what i have inside for this movie i follow this movie it s a brilliant mix of fantasy comedy romance horror erotic scary and martial arts the story about the power of love is pretty touching and warm it s a masterpiece of hong kong cinema sinnui yauman is without a doubt one of the best ghost stories ever made into film written by songling pu and directed by siu tung ching a chinese ghost story has it all ling choi sin played by leslie cheung is a young man down on his luck who goes in search of a monastery for lodging deep in the woods a place the villagers seem very afraid to go near the trek alone is perilous with wolves and a crazy taoist monk lives at the temple ling choi sin meets tsing a beautiful and mysterious young girl who also lives nearby in a deserted temple she is forced to seduce men for her evil mistress but when she meets innocent ling choi sin they fall in love ling choi sin is sort of a bumbling fool but his heart is in the right place while tsing tries to protect him from the other spirits in the woods he tries to protect her from the monk who is trying to kill the spirits in the woods there s great martial arts even a monk that breaks out into drunken song as he performs ritual taoist sword forms the movie does a lot of traditional old martial art films acrobatics with magic and flying through the air leaping from tree to tree with elegant long gowns and scarves but the movie genuinely flows and everything is effective tsing is to be married to a evil tree monster which cant be good and we feel her plight in her home where we meet her sisters and stepmother who is truly not nice in the end they must fight a tree witch with a deadly tongue and go with yin deep into the heart of hell to fight a thousand year old evil to save their souls and bring ling s ashes back to her home for a proper burial so she may have a chance at reincarnation a beautiful story that truly pays attention to details one is touched in many ways by this movie you ll laugh cry and just have fun with the great martial arts and cinematography and though at the end yin and ling choi sin ride off into the morning sun under a enchanting rainbow we never know if tsing was afforded a reincarnation but we do know her
i really enjoyed this film because i have a tremendous interest in american history the antebellum years and the civil war in particular i purchased it recently from a rack of previously viewed videos on sale at the supermarket and i was very glad to add this one to my history video collection though not of the caliber of civil war films such as glory or gettysburg provides a lot of history on the pre civil war brotherhood among cadets at west point maybe it s the gray uniforms the youth or the military discipline but i am fascinated by the story of the corps of cadets from around to the brink of the war i imagine what it must have been like to sit in a classroom with other young men learning how to make war then later putting the lessons to use against your own classmates actually there were two classes graduated in one class in may the other in june the movie makes no real mention of this except to mention henry a dupont first graduate of the may class and george custer last grad of the june class the reason for the two classes was not so much about the war but it was the result of switching back to a four year course of study after a few years of experimenting with a five year course i think the first class had attended five years the other for four as the movie portrays cadets were like brothers and often had nicknames for each other george fanny or autie custer alonzo lon cushing james beauty stuart for j e b stuart class of etc i say this film is santa fe trail as it should have been because that film while enjoyable really fudges history cadets from several different classes are all graduating together jeb stuart and george custer are portrayed as the best of friends and are side by side in stopping john brown s insurrection at harper s ferry in fact stuart and custer were never friends but enemies during the war they faced each other for the first time i think at gettysburg in stuart was at the harper s ferry raid but custer was still a cadet at the point when it took place fanny custer plays a role in class of though his classmate chums dev o neill and shelby peyton are fictional i believe they are respectively based on partick henry o rorke and john pelham two people you can look up anyway i truly enjoy this film or any film which provides a window into mid th century america
despite some negative comments this film has garnered in the imdb pages it s still worth a look as this is a story about survival and camaraderie between two different men with different mentalities while in a difficult mission in the panamanian jungle peruvian director luis llosa takes us along to watch this thriller set in panama the film has some good moments as beckett the veteran marine takes a newly arrived man recently sent to try to eliminate a notorious drug cartel head and the corrupt army general who might be the next president of the country the only problem miller has no experience in what he has been entrusted to achieve miller the arrogant newly arrived man to the jungle and to the guerrilla warfare between the military and drug lords against the infiltrated american intelligence men learns a valuable lesson from beckett what looks good in theory is irrelevant in the jungle tom berenger is an actor who doesn t register much as he proves in this movie but in the context of the movie he is right as a man of a few words billy zane playing miller does what he can with a role that doesn t afford him any glory until the crucial end for lovers of action film sniper offers an minutes of action that with a bit of trimming would have made a more satisfying movie
cry freedom is a movie about how far people will go to find the truth the first half is an interesting portrayal of an unlikely friendship between activist steve biko and editor don woods played fanatically by dezel washington and kevin klein while the second half deals with woods looking for answers on biko s death although most people favor the first half of the movie which focuses on the unlikely friendship between biko and woods i found the second half about don woods struggle to have biko s story be heard around the world much more interesting
gone in sec where do i began it keeps you in the movie with some good action and some cool cars people say its not a good movie i disagree sure it has some cheesy parts but what action movie doesn t i gave it an out of cause of the action and the comic relief if you like the rock or face off than this movie is right up your alley cage dose a good job along with one of the most under rated actors in my mind del roy lindo i think sometimes people look to far into movies some times you need to sit back enjoy the movie and after words ask yourself did they achieve what they where showing meaning if they where going for action was it action pact if they where trying to make a movie to change how movies are made and trying to win every award out their well did they i think they made the action movie they set out to make give it a chance and you wont be sorry
baseketball is an extremely funny movie that delivers acting that generally makes the movie alot funnier comedy material that is more than crap in your pants funny and a pretty good plot despite the fact that its the classic slackers v s the evil rich guy the one and only thing i didnt like about baseketball was that that kid wasnt really needed in the movie but if the kid wasnt in the movie some of the funny scenes wouldnt have existed if you have read any pro reviews about this movie exclude them all because basically all the reviewers didnt like this film baseketball is a great comedy that gives everyone what they want out of
i thought this movie was a lot better than most movie critics are giving it credit for though it has its confusing parts of the plot it doesn t greatly interfere with your understanding of the movie that being said if you re not open to more liberal political ideas then this probably isn t the movie for you i thought all the actors in the movie were outstanding each character has their funny moments and the audience at the tribeca film festival was laughing throughout the whole thing i thought the satire was a tad over the top in one particular area but that s intentionally done john cusack is right in that although it s set in the future it really makes you see the present
i m not a fan of adam sandler in fact i don t think i ve ever liked him in anything i ve seen him in the opening scene of this movie confirmed my worst fears there was adam sandler playing a somewhat ridiculous looking character riding around new york city on a motor scooter looking pitiful and lost typical sandler type loser character again i thought i almost gave up then and there but then as i stuck with this i actually discovered something i never knew before adam sandler can act he is truly outstanding in this movie as charlie a lost and lonely figure whose entire family including the dog was killed in one of the hijacked planes on and who has apparently lost all touch with reality as a result don cheadle plays his former college roommate who unexpectedly reconnects with charlie and takes it on as his mission to help him get better of course cheadle s alan johnson has his own problems and sources of unhappiness and somehow these two men manage to help each other through their difficulties the two of them made a completely believable team and sandler in particular made charlie real working through his emotions and feelings this is not a sandler comedy if your looking for that go to some of his other sillier stuff this is a pretty heavy movie sometimes sad sometimes hopeful and always engrossing there are some funny parts in it i loved the scene in which charlie convinces alan to confront his partners by reminding him of how tough he was in college and then the conversation the two of them have afterward i personally didn t think that saffron burrows added much to the movie as donna an obviously needy patient of johnson s the only reason for the character seemed based on one flashback to be that she looked eerily like charlie s late wife but that was never really developed and i just didn t care that much for the character do look for the part of the judge however played by donald sutherland who i thought nailed the part bang on as far as i m concerned though this is sandler s movie and kudos to him for a great performance definitely his best in my opinion
this film is stunningly beautiful goldsworthy s art really benefits with the medium of film because you can see the art at its most beautiful moving and changing and blossoming i strongly recommend this movie to everyone i can think of nothing else to say about it it s just the kind of movie you have to see because it s so visually compelling and left me very refreshed when i left the theatre
as much as i have enjoyed the hanzo the razor movies three is definitely enough who s got the gold the final adventure for the japanese lawman with the impressive package is a fairly enjoyable piece of pinku cinema but offers little new in terms of ideas whilst taking a big step backwards as far as outrageousness is concerned the film opens with the appearance of a female ghost and looks as though it is going to explore supernatural territory something which might have taken the series in an interesting new direction unfortunately after the spook turns out to be nothing but a scooby doo style ruse cooked up by a corrupt treasury official keen to keep people away from the lake where he is hiding stolen gold director yoshio inoue is content to recycle familiar elements from the first two films the result being a rather stale affair once again hanzo heads an investigation that requires him to interrogate women through the use of his mighty penis slice up his enemies and abuse his superiors on the way we get wild orgies good natured rape hanzo forces himself on women who wind up appreciating his willfulness and bloody sword fights if you ve already seen and appreciated the first two films you might as well watch this instalment to complete the set but be warned this is probably the least satisfying one of them all out of rounded up to for imdb
as in amelie recent french films seem to be taking a stereotypical male female relationship slant centered on a female finding her one true love in this case desperation leads to a convict which leads to her evolution into a mob prototype clever and surprising story in many ways except that the female is there to support the male for those of us that don t speak french the subtitles are a little quick but not unreasonable the soundtrack as seems to be increasingly the case with european films is great and in perfect sync with the film s variations nothing seems forced visually it reminds me of various urban horror movies there s a wes craven in chicago feel to it
another review likened this troupe to a cross between monty python and twin peaks also aptly yet another review expounded on the differences between the comedy we enjoy non critically and black comedy also well worth consideration watch the whole thing all three series at the end all the characters are tied up and the puzzle pieces fall into place just as well as a douglas adams novel the detail and intricacies are staggering thoroughly post modern wickedly funny and startlingly tragic not for kids not for those with thin skins or who lack objectivity thought provoking at once literal figurative and surreal in disturbing ways the blackest comedy i can recall and very possibly the most wonderful thing i will ever see
a famous conductor decides after a heart attack to go back to the village where he was born to live a quiet life there he comes in dutch with the local church choir that will change his life i had no expectations when i saw this movie for the first time yesterday i like watching foreign movies that are not english and i ve already seen a couple of swedish movies in my life but this one was the best so far where to start in my opinion this film is a jewel thanks to many things of which one is the outstanding acting michael nyqvist is perfect as the thoughtful almost shy and devoted conductor daniel dar us beautiful frida hallgren is enchanting with her pretty smile and her subtle acting the choir members are all well developed interesting characters with their own story each this movie tells a story a beautiful story about music love pain memories death about a man who devoted his life to music and who tries to create a calm existence in the village where he was born while trying to make peace with the past and with the way his life has been till then kay pollack shows us that the swedish are outstanding movie creators go see s som i himmelen it s a movie that makes you think about life and love and that s also comforting in some way
this film was just brilliant casting location scenery story direction everyone s really suited the part they played and you could just imagine being there robert redford s is an amazing actor and now the same being director norman s father came from the same scottish island as myself so i loved the fact there was a real connection with this film the witty remarks throughout the film were great it was just brilliant so much that i bought the film as soon as it was released for retail and would recommend it to everyone to watch and the fly fishing was amazing really cried at the end it was so sad and you know what they say if you cry at a film it must have been good and this definitely was also congratulations to the two little boy s that played the part s of norman and paul they were just brilliant children are often left out of the praising list i think because the stars that play them all grown up are such a big profile for the whole film but these children are amazing and should be praised for what they have done don t you think the whole story was so lovely because it was true and was someone s life after all that was shared with us all
bruce almighty looks and sounds incredibly stupid especially from the trailers nevertheless i found in it a deeper message that actually made me like this film more bruce jim carrey is angry at god and is given divine powers by him to be god for a week to see if he can do a better job morgan freeman plays a man symbolized here as god and though it isn t his usual type of film or one of his best roles he does excellent with what he is given to work with although crude at times the film does have quite a few laughs from bruce parting his soup in half like the red sea and the customers reactions to him as well as freeman s seemingly laid back and wisecracking image of god it is overly exaggerated at times and there is some crude humor but overall it manages to be somewhat funny there is a decent supporting cast such as jennifer aniston lisa ann walter and steve carrell which always helps the end of the film proves to be very romantic and tear jerking and the message is clear that we should do what god has called us to do and be the miracle the film is far from perfect but still enjoyable and far better than i and many people probably would have expected especially if we see the deeper message of the film out of
ok so this is coming a few weeks late but it is here mostly this is because of statements of various negative natures starting with the technology when star trek tos ran special effect technology was extreamely low tec and more than that the crew had little money to do any kind of proper mock ups in the years seince tos premiered the crew of star trek have become experts at economy ultimately they have decided quite rightly in my mind to abandon the look of tos and reverse engineered tng et all so what if they decided not to make the transporter out of gold glitter or made the phase pistols look closer to the ones from star trek ii as for the nits being picked about first contact with the klingon empire it was presumed based upon comments made by kirk and riker that earth only met the klingon s in nothing was firmly established enterprise gives us the most promising venue of exploration that we ve seen in a while this is what voyager could have been no series can evolve without a few inconsistancies but be thankful that star trek has so few so quit gripping and enjoy
elvira mistress of the dark is just that a campy concoction of fun sex appeal horror and comedy all poured into a low cut black gown and toped with a sky high black bouffant hair do this movie is sure to delight any fan of elvira s it takes you upclose and personal with elvira and probes deep into her um past revealing her enormous ancestry the movie takes you on a ride with elvira as she goes from tv horror hostess with the mostess to her home town of fallwell mass to claim her inheritance from a deceased great aunt where she encounters a stuffy town a studly cinema owner a creepy great uncle who seems to be after her for more than her good looks a slew of high school kids that immediately love her and a town board who are will do anything to get her out of town even if it means burning her at the stake watch elvira woo the kids stalk the stud avoid her creepy great uncle and thumb her nose at the stuffy uptight preservatives who have no kind words for her in elvira mistress of the dark as elvira would say i guarantee it ll be a scream screams in background whoa good thing i didn t say it d be a gas
i loved this film i first saw it when i was which was only four years ago and i enjoyed it so much i brought my own copy the next day the comedy is well played by all involved i always have to rewind and rewatch the scene where mr tsanders explains why he found water at ft in one area and feet in another area also look for jason robards father who plays mr retch talent ran in that family
this is one horror movie based tv show that gets it right friday the th the series had no connection to the movies poltergeist the legacy i m not so sure it may have been loosely connected to the movies it feels like they just throw a famous title on a show so fans will watch it it shows freddy being burned by the elm street parents in the st episode i believe and the amount of parents were disappointing with all the kids he targeted in the st movies you d expect there to be more parents but oh well freddy is basically the narrator for the show he watches the actions of people in the real world sometimes getting involved somehow just like other anthology shows like tales from the crypt there s a supernatural or surprise ending twist involved the acting lacks but believe it or not the violence sometimes surpasses that of the movie this show lasted a couple of seasons and was made around the time of the th movie i heard it was canceled due to protesting parents i watched a lot of r rated stuff as a kid so its a shame parents had to ruin it for everyone more movies came after the series so it wasn t a total loss
this is my all time favorite fred astaire and ginger rogers film the dialogue between the two is so cute and funny and very clever not to mention this film contains some of the best songs recorded by the two like i m putting all my eggs in one basket and let s face the music and dance if i remember correctly this was the film that introduced me to fred astaire so i suppose because of that it will always hold a special place in my heart sorry for the sentimental cr p but i m woman so get over it all in all this film gets an from me the choreography was superb and also the fact that lucille ball is in it makes it even more awesome
i had seen kalifornia before must be about years ago and i still remember to be very impressed by it that s why i wanted to see it again and all i can say is that it still hasn t lost its power even though i m used to a lot more when it comes to movies than that i was ten years ago kalifornia tells the tale of the writer brian kessler and his girlfriend carrie laughlin a photographer who want to move to california but instead of stepping on a plain and flying right to the state where they say it never rains they choose to make a trip by car he wants to write a book about america s most famous serial killers and she will make the matching pictures but because their car uses an enormous amount of petrol they decide to take another couple with them so they can spread the costs of the trip only one couple has answered the add so they will automatically be the lucky ones but they haven t met each other yet and when seeing the other couple for the first time when their trip has already started carrie is shocked without wanting to be prejudiced she can only conclude that early grayce and adele corners are poor white trailer park trash she definitely doesn t want them in her car but brian doesn t really mind to take them with them and decides to stop and pick them up anyway at first the couple doesn t seem to be that bad after all but gradually early grayce changes from a trashy hillbilly into a remorseless murderer not only is the story very impressive so is the acting from our four leads brad pitt is incredible as early grayce his performance in this movie may well be his best ever the same for juliette lewis she plays the childish and naive girlfriend that doesn t want to hear a bad word about her early and does that really very well but david duchovny and michelle forbes are a surprise as well they both did a very good job and i really wonder why we never heard anything from forbes again since this movie because she really proves to have a lot of talent overall this is a very good and impressive psychological thriller with a very powerful story but because of the graphic violence i can imagine that it may not be to everybody s taste although i don t really see another way how to portray a serial killer in a believable way personally i really liked this movie a lot and the violence never bothered me it s a part of the story that s too important to be left out i reward this movie with an
this was another world war ii message to the soldiers and to the allies to be careful about spreading rumors these were called instructional cartoons because it was a mixture of serious messages along with a funny looking main character called pvt snafu all of us have imaginations along with fears and what have you and that s what happens here as pvt snafu incorrectly adds two and two to something he hears and comes up with five you can start panics and all kinds of disasters if you spread enough rumors and enough people believe them that includes losing confidence in your country and your cause as pointed out here in this cartoon a good way to lose a war is demoralize the enemy that s still being done today we lost the war declares one big baloney near the end of this cartoon amazing how some americans still haven t learned this cartoon may be years old but it sure has relevance today as i write this there were two terrorist bombings in europe today and some people still think the war on terror is just a bumper sticker slogan amazing the writer the famous dr suess uses analogies of hot air balloon juice here to present the above message with theodore geisel his real name you know the rhymes will be clever nothing hilarious here but it wasn t meant to be you have to understand the climate of and the justified paranoia that was out there during world war ii people forget that war could have easily wound up with the other side winning it was a tense time
in the old commercial for blank audio cassettes the tag line was is it real or is it memorex the same might be said for the events in this episode a compilation and remix of the cage the first pilot of star trek mr spock has cleverly commandeered the ship to take it to the forbidden planet talos iv in order to allow capt christopher pike his first captain who has been burned and paralyzed to return there why the finagling because to have any contact at all with talos iv invites a death sentence why this is so is never explained that bothered me tremendously but if nothing else it adds to the story after he has gotten the ship to travel to talos iv mr spock turns himself in to dr mccoy the senior most officer present capt kirk was off the ship for arrest and says the charge is mutiny dr i never received orders to take over the ship what follows is a court martial in which thanks to the talosians we learn why it was so important besides the obvious paralysis for capt pike to get to talos iv even at risk of mr spock s death the illusions the talosians create the background music and the entire storyline are fantastic and meg wyllie as the keeper the head talosian is wonderful call me sexist but it never occurred to me to have a woman in that role but she was perfect the talosians having given up almost all physical activity and becoming almost completely reliant upon the power of illusion are also unisex you can t really tell if they re male or female and it really doesn t matter this episode more than almost any other in the series makes me hope and pray there are other worlds out there and that there are civilizations that are so far advanced what a neat thing if this were so this is one of my favorite episodes and no matter how many times i ve seen it i even have it on video it never fails to fascinate me meg wyllie looks like an alien and i do not mean that unkindly
i liked timothy dalton very much even though he was a bit young and too handsome for mr r but i thought zelah clarke too plump and short this version however was very true to the novel and very well filmed i have seen versions orson welles is still my favorite mr r though george c scott did very well and it s a toss up between joan fontaine and sussanah york although they were both a bit too old for the role i recently saw a brilliant tv version of rebecca with charles dance and emilia fox i would love to see those two do jane eyre by the time i got to watching the ciarin hinds version i think i was jane eyred out but i will never tire of those first few minutes of hearing joan fontaine s voice narrate the opening of the first version i ever saw i always want to go back and read the book again
reviewed at the world premiere screening sept at the isabel bader theatre during the toronto international film festival tiff this had an interesting premise but seemed to go on too long with too many shots of piles of ewaste recycled computers keyboards cables etc shipped over to china by the ton and then sorted and remade into new products to sell back and other desolation the filmmakers tried to get more people interviews to boost the human element but were frequently prevented from doing so due to chinese censorship still what was there was interesting the bits of a shanghai high end real estate agent preening and strutting around showing off her luxurious mansion and gardens intercut with the scenes of others living in medieval conditions were especially striking the opening tracking shot of a m factory floor was quite something as well scenes of the activity at the three gorges dam project were also a complement to the jia khang je films at tiff the feature still life sanxia haoren the documentary dong which were also built around that subject director jennifer baichwal producer nick de pencier cinematographer peter mettler and subject edward burtynsky were all there on stage for a q a after the world premiere producer noah weinzweig was introduced from the audience and was thanked as the most key person that assisted in the on the ground access in china itself
this movie was very very strange and very very funny all of the actors are quite real and very odd the overall look of the film was different too sort of dreamy and bleached out which only added to the spacey fumbling weird vibe of the whole thing it s not for everyone i mean it s not what you would call mainstream but that is what i liked about it it s unlike anything i have ever seen before unpredictable with a weird rhythm and punch lines in the strangest places the kids are so heartbreakingly goofy and pimply that you can t help but feel for them in other words these are far from hollywoodized versions of teenagers all of which for me makes it a good thing
there have been countless talking animal films in the past the majority of which either feature animals mouths digitally animated to nearly match the voice acting or are ridiculously amateur homeward bound the incredible journey is neither this film doesn t need the infant pleasing addition of moving canine lips or gesturing feline limbs it has the ability to make you believe that the animals are authentically talking to one another and you can get rather emotionally attached to them at heart as all great boy and and his dog films should homeward bound is the epitome of all family friendly animal romps to me and boasts some beautiful cinematography an inspiring soundtrack from the genius of bruce broughton and an impressive cast michael j fox chancesally field sassydon ameche shadowfrank welker voice god variousit is a modernised version of the children s classic work of fiction the incredible journey which was made into a semi documentary film by disney long long ago in the sequel lost in san fransisco isn t nearly as good a film but extends the adventure of my favourite furry footed friends and is a fun urban twist on the grand outdoor adventure theme want to entertain your children with a witty pretty heart warming mini epic without the idiotic and often utterly ridiculous comedy of modern children s cinema parents buy all three films for your children now thank you disney for bringing a tear to my eyes with each time i watch this early s classic
this is a way cool fantasy movie one of my faves it really is so cool the director is bernard rose who went on to direct candyman he made a great start with this film the film about a girl called anna who falls ill with glandular fever on her th birthday she draws a house on a shred of paper from her exercise book and falls into a dream in which the house is real each subsequent dream that she has is altered by the presence of whatever she adds to the picture in her third dream she meets a boy she thinks she has created called mark she befriends him and their relationship becomes stronger as the dreams become darker and scarier charlotte burke who plays anna is a terrific actress and it is very strange that after just one film she should disappear and never be in anything ever again she really does give a great performance in this film hans zimmer s score is also ace much like broken arrow the music is ghostly and mysterious it s a real shame that the soundtrack is not available on cd anymore the dvd is available in r only
this film has to be viewed in the right frame of mind first the central father son relationship makes it pretty clear that the film was intended as a prequel to his wong fei hung film drunken master ideas from this film recur in drunken master ii and not young master that chan backed away from this plan and renamed the characters indicates that he himself was not convinced the material was coming together properly and indeed the film conveys a sense of being incomplete for instance the romantic relationship around which half the plot turns is left utterly hanging at the end of the film young master from the same period also feels underdone but at least all its central threads are tied together at the end this film feels as though chan wrestled with the plot and characters trying to find his central theme only to abandon the effort possibly due to time and budget or perhaps the film is simply over ambitious this is an important turning point film in chan s career because he commits himself to development of the central character above all other concerns which is why there s such a lack of kung fu throughout the film chan wants to make an historical romantic comedy that just happens to have kung fu in it but both the historical element and the romantic element come across as little more than plot twists that leaves us with the comedy since chan s concern is character development the comedy is largely character driven as in the conflict between chan s character and his best friend an argument over a girl but there s plenty of slapstick as well frankly i find the comedy amusing enough to forgive the incompleteness of the plot this film represents an effort on chan s part to find a viable formula that he can use and develop over time it doesn t quite work and chan would only find that formula after abandoning the historical elements of his earlier films with the making of the contemporary action comedy police story but going back to view this film is still very informative as to how chan worked his way through the historical genre and perhaps why he abandoned it
picture the scene a mountainous alien landscape twin moons illuminate the blood red sky the tardis lands and out steps the doctor a middle aged man in a victorian frock coat and rose his companion from earth a flicker of recognition crosses his face well i never its the planet saurious where i fought the warlike kraggartians they tried to use giant skinkons to take over the planet the girl sniffs the air can t we go doctor i don t like the look of this place i keep thinking we re being watched the doctor wags a disapproving finger don t be silly girl i wonder if the king and queen of cordaraby city remember me from my last visit come along rose come along he strides off the girl struggles to keep up high on a hill sinister red eyes regard them with hatred that was not how rose began back in and thank heavens for that say i unfairly derided at the time of its original u k broadcast rose can now safely be regarded as a landmark episode putting dr who back where it belonged as one of the b b c s flagship programmes the mistakes made by the mcgann t v movie were well learnt instead of trying to shoehorn the new who into existing chronology it represented a fresh start for the series beginning with shop girl rose tyler billie piper going about her daily routine one day she goes to the basement to find a man named wilson and then the trouble begins mannequins come to life and attack her it is only through the intervention of a mysterious stranger christopher eccleston that she is saved the story slight though it may be is more than adequate as a starting point for the series the autons are of course an old villain this was their first appearance since but no references are made to their past appearances another wise move the finale effectively recreated the famous scene in spearhead from space when shop window dummies sprang to life as the doctor christopher eccleston lacked the eccentricity of his predecessors preferring a modern leather jacket to the doctor s traditional period clothes but this made him more accessible to the show s hoped for new audience billie piper confounded her critics by making a big impression as rose also good was noel clarke as her boyfriend mickey yes there was an added emphasis on special effects but then there needed to be the wobbly sets and unconvincing monsters of the past have no place on st century television what is more important is how good a script this is ten million people tuned in to see the new doctor dr who was back and back with a bang
you ll probably never see it but the uncut version is about better than the one you can buy put it another way once you ve seen it in its original form the current version is only half as good it s still wildly creative and sick a total success on so many levels
carla is a secretary who is essentially deaf without her hearing aids when she finds herself overloaded at work she is able to hire paul to help her out paul is just out of jail and his past is not entirely behind him to say too much more about the story which has many twists would be a mistake the most interesting thing about this film for me is how sound is used to indicate when carla can hear and when she can t a sort of point of hear like point of view the early scenes that set this up as well as the early character development of carla and paul was more interesting to me than the twists and turns later on some of which were hard to follow and or stretched credibility a bit there is also some unpleasant violence back to the positive side the cinematography was very good the film is worth seeing but perhaps not seeking out seen at the san francisco international film festival on
alright i have to admit that i have never seen rhoda and only one or two episodes of the mary tyler moore show even though i don t know anything about this duo of comedic talent i still liked this movie a lot mary goes back to work rose tries her luck at being a comedian rhoda struggles with a photography career and meredith what exactly does she do again these three stories that we follow over two hours are amusing and entertaining in their own way when the two long time friends reunite it only makes the film better i was surprised about how good the writing was the little jokes thrown in by mary and rhoda were funny the script itself was very well put together i had seen moore and harper in other movies over the past few years and thought that they were very good but i had no idea that they worked this well as a team while both actresses do their share to fulfill the title of this movie they never seem to let me down during the run of this movie joie lenz and marisa ryan play their roles okay but nothing great the rest of the cast like jonah cecile and everybody else also works well together being that this is a reunion you would expect for a fan of either show to enjoy this from a non fan i still enjoyed this little get together good story lines for each character and the two main characters is what makes this film very good the newer version of the mtm theme song doesn t hurt either
this film is like marmite you either love it or you hate it if you go into this film expecting a proper film with decent production values a good plot and great characters you ll hate it if you go into this film expecting a low budget slasher you ll probably hate it if you go into this film expecting to see one of the most deranged characters ever put to film in the form of harry russo you will love it john giancaspro is absolutely brilliant in his over the top portrayal of the insane murderous coke fiend the special effects are abysmal at best but really who cares if you re the kind of person who s prepared to watch a film schizophreniac the whore mangler you ve undoubtedly seen scores of horror films filled with gore with the budget this film was made for even if they had tried it probably would ve mediocre at best i d much rather be able to laugh at something abysmal than be unaffected by the mediocre to sum it up you ll probably hate this film but if you re one of the few who decide to see it anyway it ll become the best thing since sliced bread i hate marmite
i was shocked and surprised by the negative reviews i saw on the web i thought cinderella as well as is a very cute and funny sequel for everyone kids and adults like me i am years old i also find it and very informative film it shows lessons on being true to yourself and following your heart i thought it has great animation and the voice casting was very good the songs performed by brooke allison too since this film has been divided into three flashbacks stories my favorite out of the three is the story of when jaq the mouse became a human for a day thanks to fairy godmother and her magic
ride with the devil like ang lee s later brokeback mountain is a film of aesthetic and historical importance film lovers ought to see it at minimum twice as its artistic nuance is worthy to be over comprehended a perfect piece of art surprising depth of humanity i really don t recall another war film will so capture you will change your existing conception of history and politics will restore your belief in humanity after seeing so many killings so many sufferings you don t feel yourself numb instead you treasure the bond between human beings more the actors performances haunt your heart the music drives your mind some shoots are not just some pictures they transcend themselves becoming the seeing of soul such is the true sense of film being a genre of art a film like this doesn t need long comments or reviews everything it says by itself ovation to the cast which includes tobey maguire jeffrey wright and jewel kilcher the cinematographer and the composer of the beautiful and lyrical music what an achievement
i d have to say this is one of the best animated films i ve ever seen i liked it the first time but really appreciated it on the second viewing just a few weeks ago i can see why sequel is doing such great business at the box office apparently a lot of people liked this movie a gorgeous color palette man this looks good and a lot of good adult but clean humor make this a big winner the opening minute scene with scat is excellent as are subsequent interludes with him sid the sloth voiced by john leguizano however provides the main humor in the movie he usually has something funny to say throughout the movie ray romano is the voice of the mammoth the big character of the film literally while denis leary is the ferocious bad guy turned good sabertooth tigerthis isn t just humor and pretty colors but a nice sentimental story of how a little baby softens up a couple of tough characters this isn t interrupted with a lot of songs either one only brief one and there is nothing offensive language wise if more animated movies were this good i d own more
this is a brilliant political satire no wonder why it was largely ignored in the u s it exposes our murderous foreign policy for what it really is another good film from this era rendition was also totally dismissed simply because it showed accurately that the u s is a war machine bent on torturing murdering and maiming civilians in its quest for total world domination a clever plot good acting some big stars john cusack ben kingsley marisa tomei anyone and some scenes of hilarity should have made this movie a hit unfortunately americans don t like to hear the truth about themselves especially when they are complicit in mass murder
kristine watts molie weeks is broken apart missing her lover she is not able to overcome her love for him that is lost in the past she hires a stranger douglas davis and gives a list of her mistakes to him with things to fix but time is irreversible and sometimes the cure for the pain is a tragic end the first point that impresses in the cure is the stylish cinematography that alternates black and white with color the concise and sharp screenplay is capable to develop a tragic and bleak tale of love with an unexpected plot point in the very end in less than eight minutes the soundtrack is beautiful but the volume is a little loud and associated to the fact that english is not my native language in some moments i needed to repeat some words whispered by the narrator the unknown lead actress has magnificent performance and is extremely gorgeous i hope to have a chance to see her again on the screen last but not the least the debut of the director and writer ryan jafri could not be better my vote is nine title brazil not available
lily mars a smalltown girl living in indiana dreams of making it big on broadway and her aspirations are given a lift when successful broadway producer john thornway returns to his hometown for a visit lily tries everything she can to get thornway to notice her but he just gets annoyed with her antics when thornway goes back to new york to stage his show lily follows unknown to john of course and thornway eventually gives her a small role in his next show only as a favor to her family however thornway starts to fall for this young girl and a romance blossoms which makes the show s leading lady isabel rekay jealous when isabel gets fed up with the john lily romance causing friction with the show she leaves and john decides to make lily the star isabel returns later and thornway is forced to tell lily that she is back to her small bit role in the play which also may jeopardize the romance very charming film and a refreshing change to see garland put the comedic touches into her role her reading of lady macbeth while supposed to be humorous never threatened her singing career i enjoyed heflin s character thornway more when he was annoyed with lily rather than be the romantic the film got to be somewhat predictable and the scenes weren t assembled that well together but a very enjoyable film rating
this was a fabulous adaptation of jane eyre the only problem i had with it was that i didn t like zelah clarke i thought she was too old and made jane seem much to timid in the book jane seemed like a much stronger character i was really annoyed by this portrayal of her the part where it s the morning after rochester asks her to marry him and she runs up to him and hugs him always makes me laugh i think they made a bad choice in casting her but dalton was absolutely wonderful as rochester he makes this version of jane eyre worth seeing another thing that made this version not quite was the quality of film i know it was made in the eighties for tv if it had been a feature film and better quality it would have been perfect my main complaint however is that zelah clarke was definitely too old
shakespeare s plays have a way of transcending time the language somehow breaks the time barrier but perhaps it is the actors who really do that after the disappointment in romeo and juliet the version with claire danes and leonardo dicaprio was hesitant take on another modern rendition of shakespeare to my surprise othello was great iago s character was played so well by the kenneth fellow even thoough iago is really evil and despicable the character was played so well that it does what shakespeare intended for the charater to be a pleasure for the audience to hate i have to say that fishburne s performance here was really good as well i recommend this for shakespeare scholars and lazy students who refuse to read the book alike
this is a good adaptation of austen s novel good but not brilliant the cinematography is inventive crossing at times the border to gimmickry but it certainly avoids the trap of making this look like a boring tv soap in costumes given that the entire story is dialogue driven the acting is competent ms paltrow is aloof as her character requires but the required distance from the other characters is accompanied by a much less appropriate detachment from her own actions in other words she does not seem to care enough of the results of her match making endeavours some of the supporting cast is guilty of over acting very much in the style that is appreciated on stage but out of place in motion pictures personally i had problems accepting alan cumming as mr elton to no fault of his own except for having left such an impression as a gay trolley dolly in the high life that it is now difficult to accept him playing any serious part acting honours go to toni collette who manages to radiate warmth and jeremy northam who pitches his character at just the right level
kirk and crew land on a lonely planet where the sun is about to explode they intend to evacuate the inhabitants but find the place deserted except for a mr atoz who operates some sort of high tech library despite trying to get a straight answer from him about everyone s whereabouts atoz is indifferent to their questions and insist they must quickly make a selection while there is still time they have no idea what he s talking about but wander about looking at the hand mirror like disks on the viewers and they see images of the planet s past then while a disk is in the viewer kirk runs through the doorway and is magically transported back in time to what on earth would look like the time of louis xiv the s when mccoy and spock follow a different disk is in the viewer and they are sent to an ice age hell all too late they realize that the library is a time travel machine and repository while kirk s visit is pretty short and not all that exciting spock and mccoy s is much more eventful as spock falls head over heels for mariette hartley who was sent to this awful place as a punishment the scenes with spock are exceptionally interesting and very atypical of the normally logical guy spock s departure from the norm the wildly inventive script and very diverse locales make this an exceptional episode one well worth seeing fyi ian wolfe the excellent character actor played mr atoz i am a huge fan of older films and have seen him as a supporting and bit player in countless films in the s and s and he looked almost exactly like he did in this episode from interestingly enough despite looking ancient he lived on another years dying at over years of age
young handsome muscular joe buck jon voight moves from texas to new york thinking he ll make a living by being a stud he gets there and finds out quickly that it isn t going to be easy he goes through one degrading experience after another at the end of his rope he hooks up with crippled sleazy ratso rizzo dustin hoffman together they try to survive and get out of the city and move to florida but will they make it very dark disturbing yet fascinating movie director john schelsinger paints a very grimy portrait of nyc and its inhabitants in that way it s dated the city may have been this bad in but it s cleaned up considerably by now he also uses every camera trick in the book color turning to black white trippy dream sequences flash forwards flash backs especially involving a rape shock cuts weird sound effects you name it it keeps you disoriented and off center but i couldn t stop watching there isn t much of a story it basically centers on the friendship between rizzo and buck there is an implication that they may have been lovers the final shot sort of shows that it s just a portrait of two damaged characters trying to survive in a cold cruel urban jungle this was originally rated x in the only reason being that the mpaa didn t think that parents would want their children to see this nevertheless it was a big hit with high schoolers back then x meant no one under it also has been the only x rated film ever to win an academy award as best picture hoffman and voight were up for acting awards as was mysteriously sylvia miles who was in the picture for a total of maybe minutes it was eventually lowered to an r with no cuts when it was reissued in also the excellent song everybody s talkin was introduced in this film and became a big hit a great film but very dark i m giving it a don t see it on commercial tv it s cut to ribbons and incomprehensible
i first saw this back in the early s on uk tv i did like it then but i missed the chance to tape it many years passed but the film always stuck with me and i lost hope of seeing it tv again the main thing that stuck with me was the end the hole castle part really touched me its easy to watch has a great story great music the list goes on and on its ok me saying how good it is but everyone will take there own best bits away with them once they have seen it yes the animation is top notch and beautiful to watch it does show its age in a very few parts but that has now become part of it beauty i am so glad it has came out on dvd as it is one of my top films of all time buy it or rent it just see it best viewing is at night alone with drink and food in reach so you don t have to stop the film enjoy
this version of anna christie is in german greta garbo again plays anna christie but all of the other characters have different actors from the english version both were filmed back to back because garbo had such a following in germany garbo herself supposedly favored her anna christie in this version over the english version it s a good tale and a must see for garbo fans
as a movie this barely rates a but for movie fans of the s period it s almost a must see and rates a as a variety show i was drawn to watch this by the presence of richard captain midnight webb who plays the colonel in charge of the event what surprised me was the stunning performance of doris day outside of calamity jane i ve never seen her put over a song better than she does here randolph scott is memorable as well even if he doesn t see much screen time it s been a while since i saw the movie but i was almost sure humphrey bogart put in an appearance with so many familiar faces it s hard to keep track if it ever turns up on a tv station near you be sure to catch the doris day sequence if nothing else
i m not sure if it is available worldwide but if anyone who s deciding what is supposed to be put on videotapes and distributed in video clubs is reading this please please buy it if i wasn t clear get the movie into videostores can t be explained must see
i hadn t heard about brashear before i watched this this is the story of him and the man who trained him helping him to become the first african american us navy diver a tale of will power the plot is well written and develops nicely throughout this is what it seems the typical underdog thing and it doesn t hold too many surprises it s also quite hollywood but hey i don t know the actual man maybe it s close to how it actually happened nevertheless it gets the job done with dramatic scenes and adversity along the way and this is inspirational for anyone who s ever heard the words no you can t be spoken about their life long dream the acting performances are all excellent deniro and gooding jr both shine whenever they re on screen rapaport is marvelous as well the characters are well written credible and consistent this is well edited and features good cinematography the production values are high and this does a fairly convincing job of transporting us back to the s this is the only film i ve seen by this director and the writer though i may now consider looking into more they re responsible for there is a moderate amount of strong language otherwise no offensive material i recommend this to anyone who finds the subject interesting and or fans of those who made it
it is rare that one comes across a movie as flawless as this it s truly one of the best acted most tightly structured films i ve ever seen every line of dialogue can be interpreted in several ways relating to each of the three main characters differently the film weaves an intrinsic web of motivations and double crosses that snare you and refuse to let go add to this that the slow burning romance between kevin and faye is as moving as anything that s ever been committed to celluloid and you have the ingredients for a perfect film it exposes the romance of movies such as titanic as the trite cliches they are if you re looking for a movie to watch while you fold laundry this isn t it you have to commit yourself to this film you can t have a conversation while running in and out of the room this movie demands your attention treat it with the respect you deserve and you ll get a lot out of it unless you think titanic is the greatest film ever
i read a few reviews of this tv movie which all said that the film dragged on for too long and that it was basically only sensationalistic entertainment i agree that perhaps the film goes on a bit too long h would have been enough but i certainly do not think it sensationalize the subject matter jim jones expansive power trip and slow degradation into mental illness paranoia and drug abuse are never treated in a voyeuristic manner the movie takes its time in showing how jones recruited followers brenda vaccaro s and brad dourif s character are stand outs in that matter but also in observing an uncanny shift in jones perception of reality it is mind boggling to see an egalitarian left wing and compassionnate preacher become such a destructive and cruel dictator perhaps the movie doesn t explore jones motivations enough which can make the whole ordeal a bit superficial at times may have to do with censorship as well but powers boothe s mesmerizing performance makes it all come true i am not familiar with the details of the real jim jones life but boothe sure makes the monster he plays believable and real the movie features many strong scenes among them the preaching messes of jones jones s meeting with father divine a remarquable james earl jones congressman leo ryan ned beatty s visit to the guyana camp and of course the suicide scene it is quite a gloomy spectable to watch and boothe is quite commanding in those last moments madge sinclair shines in this scene as one of the suddenly sceptic follower and so do veronica cartwright as jones wife and brad dourif especially when their time comes to drink the murderous potion the relative calm of the end of this scene the tasteful direction and the contrasting beauty of the natural surroundings all work in making those images quite impossible to erase from one s mind a disturbing reflection on human nature and its weaknesses worth watching if only to keep in mind one of the truly horrific events of the th century not to let it be repeated again like ironically the inscription in jim jones camp those who do not know the past are bound to repeat it
this is an early film pilot for the hit canadian tv show trailer park boys it was played to executives at a few networks before showcase decided to sign them up for a tv series great acting and a very funny cast make this one of the best cult comedy films the movie plot is that these two small time criminals go around exterminating peoples pets for money if you have a dog next door whos barking all night these are the guys you go to but they get into trouble when they come across a job too big for them to deal with and end up in a shootout watch this movie if you want to understand the beginning of the tv series i highly recommend it rated r for swearing violence and drug use its not too offensive either they dont actually show killing animals
i found about the movie holes by hearing from people that it wasn t typical disney that both kids and adults both got into the story folks let me tell you i wasn t disappointed holes is based on the novel by louis sachar and follows the adventure of stanley yelnats a boy who gets sent to a strange juvenile detention camp out in the desert he befriends a boy nicknamed zero and together they set out on adventure that changes their lives it was a very interesting unique different and funny story i didn t know quite what to expect when i watched it it was interesting to see the story come together like pieces of a puzzle the boys who played the juvenile delinquents were all very funny and jon voight was just hilarious as mr sir now that i ve seen the movie i have to read the book most recommended
this movie is a ripoff of james cain s novel the postman always rings twice apparently the director and producer never bothered to pay for rights to this story perhaps the fact that we were in the middle of fighting the italians in wwii might account for their forgetting to consider royalties despite this the movie isn t really just an italian version of the hollywood movie in some ways it s a lot better and in other ways it is definitely not the three central characters in this movie are really pretty ugly people in fact the male and female lovers are a bit icky looking the male lead is pretty ordinary except for his profuse body hair particularly on the back and shoulders and his lady love is to put it frankly unattractive they are a very very far cry from lana turner and john garfield in the hollywood version and the ill fated husband is really really obese and loves to walk around shirtless and his counterpart in the american film cecil kellaway is definitely better looking and probably better looking than the other two italian leads actually and this unattractiveness is generally a reason i actually preferred the italian film since i just could not imagine a finely coiffed dish like lana turner in the middle of nowhere married to kellaway i am sure she would have had dozens of better offers whereas the italian wife frankly might not have been able to do much better and this made the marriage actually believable part of the italian film s believability comes from the blunt way it handles sex the sanitized american film tries to make you believe that although turner and garfield kill kellaway they never actually get around to sex this is pretty silly and totally unrealistic in addition to the casual sexuality of the film it s also pretty casual in showing the seamy side of life with lots of sweaty people a fly strip hanging over the kitchen table and everyone appeared to need a bath the movie is also pretty fast paced compared to the over long american film and what you get due to brevity isn t all good the film lacks a lot of the style and polish of the american film with grainier footage relatively poor orchestration and sets it sure ain t a pretty film but the neo realistic like style makes the film seem more realistic but it cannot make up for the short cuts in the plot many of the plot elements in the later american version are either missing entirely or glossed over and the ending seems a lot less interesting than the american film and misses the entire human nature dilemma when turner and garfield turn on each other like rats the best part of the american film so which is the better film well a lot of this probably depends on you as for me the warner brothers film was simply too polished and too unrealistic though many like this style and may dislike watching films with subtitles but it packed a great ending and the italian film was much much more realistic until the crappy ending that seemed too rushed so neither film is exactly great but i d give my nod to the italian one being a bit better it s too bad they couldn t have combined the best elements of both films into one exceptional film
home room like zero day and elephant was inspired by the recent wave of school shootings but unlike the other two films home room focuses on two survivors not the shooters or those killed in the aftermath of a shooting making it less exploitive and more useful because little effort is wasted in asking questions for which there are no answers don t give up on this little film during the first minutes it is supposed to set up the real story but plays like a rejected hill street blues episode it is lame but bear with it at least it pads the running length enough to get the film classified as a feature i recommend skipping this entirely and just jumping ahead to the hospital scenes there is nothing here that you can t pick up from the remainder of the film like a lot of good little films this was creatively a one man show as paul f ryan was both the writer and the director while this arrangement does not guarantee a good film it is usually a good sign because it will mean a certain unity of construction and execution that is often lacking in big budget dramatic features because the script of home room is its real strength it is fortunate that the writer also executed the production and insured that his vision made it onto the screen ryan takes a huge chance with the ending which tests the limits of the average viewer s sentimentality tolerance he runs it right up to the edge but against all logic leaves you crying instead of cringing why the ending works is some combination of the audience need for a reward at the end of this kind of journey the song sarah mclaughlin s sweet surrender he goes out on and the amazing editing of the final minute the other strength of the film is the casting of busy phillips alicia and erika christensen deanna as the main protagonists although phillips plays her standard alienated surly teen and christensen her intelligent daughter of a good family they both bring more intensity to their roles than ever before the family life of both girls is more than satisfactory and of little interest to ryan what is happening here is all about the two of them despite a lame side story about a police detective wondering around town trying to tie alicia to the lone shooter if they ever re cut and trim the film this side story should be condensed a story about two extremely disparate girls bonding and helping each other is hardly a novel idea and ryan could have easily steered this film into clich and predictability but instead his script has them engaging in a fascinating and convincing sparring match slowly chipping away at each other and sharing moments of vulnerability only to retreat back inside themselves deanna s i m dying inside line just tears you apart i can t think of a moment in any other film that i felt as intensely as that one she desperately needs a connection that alicia just as desperately resists deanna only makes progress when she retreats the viewer keeps expecting the group hug that never seems to happen ultimately this not only generates a lot of suspense but leaves you admiring both characters and the two actresses who brought them to life then again what do i know i m only a child
in with the success of the first season of batman the animated series warner brothers commissioned the team responsible for the hit show with producing a feature length movie originally slated for direct to video but bumped up to theatrical status it would become known as batman mask of the phantasm ten years after phantasm we have had an additional three feature films released from the boys at the wb sub zero return of the joker and now mystery of the batwoman joins the family the plot is basic and in many ways similar to mask of the phantasm a new female vigilante modeling herself after batman has begun targeting operations run by gotham mob boss rupert thorne and oswald cobblepot aka the penguin now batman must attempt to unravel the mystery of the batwoman before she crosses the line the animation is the sleeker futuristic style that was utilized for batman the animated series fifth and sixth seasons aka the new batman adventures it s quite nicely done and just as sleek as return of the joker s animation there is also some use of cgi but it s minor compared to the overabundance of it in sub zero the music was alright different and exotic and similar to the justice league score although the points in the score when the old animated batman theme comes up will be sure to send waves of nostalgia through the older fans rodent shaped hearts kevin conroy as always does a wonderful job as bruce wayne and batman it s also great to have the old batman the animated series alumni back that includes bob hastings commissioner gordon robert costanzo detective bullock tara strong barbara gordon batgirl her cameo hints at the romantic relationship between her and bruce that was mentioned in batman beyond and efrem zimbalist jr alfred villains were also great especially given that rupert thorne the old mob boss from the original series appears for the first time since the fourth season overall while not quite reaching the standard set by mask of the phantasm ten years ago motb carries on the torch quite nicely for the animated batman films and if you have the dvd and are a hardcore fan you will love the five minute short chase me
i enjoy movies like this for their spirit no pun intended its a decent clean movie about a baseball team that s falling behind and a young fan wishes for them to win since his deadbeat dad said that was the only way he d come back for him the spirit shines through in two ways a funny cast with danny glover and a young joseph gordon levitt and the heavenly herald al taking the dynamic form of christopher lloyd its an energetic movie it gets you smiling and really involves you in the sport therein lies my gripe the one thing that kinda bugs me is these sports movies that kind of turn you into an unexpecting fan for the team there s absolutely nothing wrong with that i just find it odd that i should come away from the movie thinking the angels are a strong cool team when really my base loyalty such as it is lies with the toronto blue jays it s interesting really if it s just a movie about an underdog kids team then its okay
in the area of movies based off of screenplays from some other area or whatever the title for that oscar is holes has credibility i think it is better to have the author create the screenplay because the author is the creator of the material if the author can t write a screenplay to save their life then have the author and someone fluently talented in the area of screenwriting create it aside from that this review is about holes the reasons start here and a spoiler maybe found within louis sachar is an excellent author and it turns that he can write a screenplay i watched the movie and then read the book and both didn t reek incoherence or stupidity some people just have natural talents that can transcend mediums the best performance award goes to shia labeouf for his portrayal as the main character he dug himself into the role i wanted to see his character vindicated before the conclusion to ratchet up the suspense a bit andrew davis was brought in this is the man that made harrison ford run hard and run fast he also can make steven seagal smash some heads as for this film he made shia and the rest of the boys dig some holes in other words he can make an action packed movie and make it well even if action isn t the main genre isn t action my second favorite performance goes to jon voight as mr sir sometimes a goofy role brings out the best in a performer when voight uttered the line once upon a time i must have laughed for half a minute because it was so funny he is capable of comedy and he should investigate a few more roles that let him to exercise that talent tim blake nelson is very solid whenever he is given a solid script this is probably the second best role i have seen him in second only to o brother where art thou i love the choice of settings for the movie i didn t know california was that dry or that barren i guess population and land area figures both can be misleading the overall look of the movie made me want another bottle of water one could only imagine digging a hole in that barren area for half a day the rest of the cast should deserve a box of kudos bars as well sigourney weaver henry winkler khleo thomas jake m smith and the rest of the bill were tapped because of their talents and it gelled very well great cast even though it was anywhere near ensemble i like a movie that doesn t explain anything right away when stanley got clocked in the head with those baseball cleats it made me want to see how weird the events could get and that is a key ingredient in making a good movie disney pictures not touchstone disney needs to make a few more of these mature juvenile films it was palatable for me and i am a college student the last mature juvenile disney film i saw was something wicked this way comes and holes possibly exceeds it like the election in it s still to close to call disney can make greatness if they decide to expand on this genre and keeps artistry in mind over milking a cash cow when they see it ten reasons give a score of ten all in all holes is one of my favorite disney films and probably one of the best this year granted this movie may not be oscar material but whoever said oscar material is the best material in terms of being a movie from a book i have read this ranks behind fight club on my list which is on top for being a film i saw in this is in the top five somewhere behind mystic river compared against harry potter stanley yelnats easily takes a shovel to harry s head and brings the final death blow with a smelly sneaker to potter s nose everybody should see this movie because it both informs and entertains here ends my rant
this review is for the extended cut of this movie i first watched dragon lord when i bought it on dvd many years ago i always liked this movie and you can read some of the more positive reviews of it to get the general idea that being said i ve always found the storyline a bit confusing the movie is after all a love story and it always seemed strange to me that a love story should end with a minute fight scene well in the extended version this is no longer so the old original version begins off with a huge barrel climb rugby like sequence which is the new ending sequence in the extended version the opening sequence is dragon jackie chan hanging around his house and pretending to be training and reciting whenever his father is around other sequenced have also been shift or prolonged in the extended cut and the story makes a lot more sense when you watch it the pacing is also better and overall it just works better it feels more like a love story and doesn t leave you asking questions about why it ends so drastically and dramatically as the regular version does i suggest everyone who is a hong kong cinema or just plain jackie chan fanatic to get a hold of the extended version and watch the movie the way it was originally intended or at least that s how i think it was intended why else would they make it and rearrange some of the scenes when i was done watching it i felt like i had watched a completely new jackie chan movie although most of the sequences were the same
the main reason i wanted to see this movie was because of the wonderful cast a ton of my favorite actors in one movie equals amazing with out actually seeing it but this movie caught me off guard it wasn t what i was expecting at all it s been a while since i ve seen it but i do remember i could not stop laughing and it wasn t just the cast that did it for me the script was amazingly written every time you were expecting something to happen it didn t happen there were so many twists and turns but it fit with the whole tone of the movie instead of coming off as pretentious the cinematography along with the set was absolutely beautiful as well i really can t say anything bad about this movie expcept i would have andrew davoli a little more screen time
feroz abbas khan s gandhi my father a film that sheds light on the fractured relationship between the mahatma and his son harilal gandhi for a story that s as dramatic as the one this film attempts to tell it s a pity the director fails to tell it dramatically gandhi my father is narrated to you like that boring history lesson that put you to sleep at school now the film aims to convey one very interesting point the fact that gandhi in his attempt to be a fair person ended up being an unfair father this point is made in the film many times over and one of the examples given to make this point is that scholarship to england which gandhi twice denies his son instead of showing us how exactly harilal dealt with this betrayal and what went on in his head the director just moves along with the story thus never letting us be witness to the growing resentment harilal feels towards his father which is why when we finally see an outburst from harilal it comes off looking like he s over reacting the point i m trying to make here is that we never really get to understand exactly why harilal became the rebel that he did we never really understand why he turned to islam and then back again to hinduism the thing is we never really understand harilal at all and that s because the director of this film is too busy focusing on mohandas karamchand gandhi and his role in the freedom struggle a story most of us are already familiar with to put it simply gandhi my father promises to examine the strained father son relationship but it doesn t so much as show us where the cracks in this relationship first set in we understand harilal had to live with the burden of being gandhi s son but show us why that was a burden to begin with show us incidents of their early conflict for example it s not enough that gandhi merely says he s opposed to harilal s early marriage tell us why this opposition it s not enough that kasturba blames her husband for the way her son turned out for constantly shuttling him between schools in gujarat and south africa for making him relocate every time gandhi needed to relocate words are not enough show us how these incidents shaped the character of harilal gandhi what s more instead of sticking with the prickly theme of this tenuous gandhi versus gandhi relationship the film goes off on too many tangents thus diluting the impact of the central theme this was never meant to be a film about the struggle for independence and yet on many occasions that s exactly what it seems like because the director feels almost obligated to take us through all the main events leading upto that historic moment even though much of it has no relevance to the film s basic premise the stormy father son relationship so you see the problem with this film is not that it s a bad film but it s certainly a very confused film what happens to harilal s children after his wife s death does he ever have relationship with them where do they suddenly vanish after that one scene in which we see them with the mahatma and kasturba none of these questions are answered in a film that s basically meant to be about relationships in the gandhi family the film version of an immensely popular play directed by feroz abbas khan himself gandhi my father is a disappointment no questions asked cinematically it struggles to translate the filmmaker s ambitious intention to the screen practically every single scene in the film opens and closes with fade ins and fade outs never quite seamlessly leading into each other on the positive side there is inherent nobility in the film which you recognise the filmmaker makes every effort to deliver a balanced narrative trying hard not to take sides never once judging either father or son painting neither as the villain what the film does do however is make clear the fact that gandhi was a difficult patriarch whose ideals may have shaped the nation but evidently alienated his family of all the actors in the film it s only akshaye khanna who really shines in the role of the luck deprived harilal gandhi it s a wonderful performance and it s not easy since the role covers virtually the entire lifespan of the character but akshaye brings a rare concoction of innocence and despondency to that part and succeeds in making harilal a pitiable figure just watch him in that scene in which he discovers his wife s dead and you ll realise how much he conveys through body language alone darshan jariwala meanwhile who plays gandhi senior adopts a caricaturish approach to playing the mahatma in his later years but it s the way he humanises the man in his early years as a barrister in south africa that is the actor s best contribution to that role the abundantly gifted shefali shah plays kasturba the woman who s meant to be torn in this father son conflict but if she s unable to bring across that feeling of helplessness then it s really not so much her fault as it is the fault of a rickety script much effort s gone into the making of this film and that s evident throughout but the film suffers from that inevitable flaw that is eventually what you ll remember about it when you leave the cinema it s just so boring director feroz abbas khan s gandhi my father is a sincere effort yes but also a film that could have done with a much tighter screenplay what we learn from the film is that gandhi and harilal made each other very unhappy and with this film the director makes us too
i ve been trying to find out about this series for ages thank you imdb i saw this as a child and have never quite been able to get it out of my mind as a year old of course i was particularly struck by the episode of the cyclops which was absolutely chilling i talked about it so much that my older brother made me a cyclops out of a plastic cave man figurine which i still have what i also remember though was the atmosphere which was unusual right from the beginning mysterious austere and extremely authentic when i read the original many years later i experienced that same sensation it s a very hard thing to capture and probably impossible in hollywood every odyssey i ve seen since has been an enormous let down the characters in this series seemed genuine real people ancient greek people and not some hollywood stars in costumes this is a real masterpiece but why is it not better known and why isn t it available on vhs or dvd i would just love to have the chance to see this again
the secret fury in many ways a run of the mill romantic suspense drama directed by mel ferrer boasts top notch principals in colbert and ryan it stays puzzling if not quite gripping until towards the end when implausibility conquers suspension of disbelief as so often it does in this genre but for some viewers the film s highlight will be the portrayal of blowsy leah by vivian vance the immortal ethel mertz on i love lucy oddly vance had very few film roles her true home was broadway where among other gigs she understudied for ethel merman here she contributes a winning turn as a chambermaid suborned to play a minor part in a nefarious scheme watch her half heartedly trying to wave away the smoke when she s puffing a furtive cigarette in the hotel s linen storage room a transgression for which she ultimately pays the supreme penalty
i never thought an old cartoon would bring tears to my eyes when i first purchased casper friends spooking about africa i so much wanted to see the very first casper cartoon entitled the friendly ghost but when i saw the next cartoon there s good boos to night it made me break down i couldn t believe how sad and tragic it was after seeing casper s fox get killed i never saw anything like that in the other casper cartoons this is the saddest one of all it was so depressing i just couldn t watch it again it s just like seeing lassie die at the end of a movie i know it s a classic but it s too much for us old cartoon fans to handle like me if i wanted to watch something old and classic i rather watch something happy and funny but when i think about this casper cartoon i think about my cats
rod serling was of course a genius and his wonderful playful creative mind left something of the period in which he lived and examples of television at that state of development there are no such shows now but rather housewife sluts ala eva longoria or terri hatcher or the pitiful stabs at humor and witty banter that litter our high tech screens jack elam edged into the episode with such acting precision and with his usual craziness that i can t help but think that rod serling was tailoring that long ago week s show around elam even though he was an ancillary to the flow of the story this episode ends with a twist as usual but shock and humor are mixed with especially serlingesque dexterity rex lewis field
very good western this was the first time writer richard wilson directed a film also this was a first for samuel goldwyn junior as a producer it is a pleasure to see a very young and pretty angie dickinson as a saloon girl robert mitchum comes to this town dominated by outlaws and is hired as a town tamer but people are worried that he will go too far also about the harm that he will do to the town s businesses there are some similarities in the story with warlock which was made in this film keeps a very fast and exciting pace it really keeps you on the edge
much like the comedy duo of its title the sunshine boys has become a forgotten classic odd years later it s hardly mentioned alongside other great film comedies of the s this makes no sense given the singular specialness of this film perhaps the best neil simon ever wrote walter matthau plays willy clark once half of a legendary vaudeville comedy known as lewis and clark now a bitter year old solo act who can t get a job in a potato chip commercial his nephew and agent ben richard benjamin is sure he can get work if willy will only agree to reunite with his estranged partner al lewis george burns for an abc tv celebration of show business nostalgia nostalgia is what sunshine boys has going for it in spades right from the start when a series of s film clips showcasing various entertainers from long ago flickers before us to the accompaniment of cole porter s be a clown then there s the film s present day setting in manhattan where flared trousers and wide polyester ties abound the periods collide in willy s glorious mess of a manhattan apartment where framed photos and cartoons of long dead celebrities stare out from the walls at lurid tabloid headlines and empty zabar grocery bags if you were alive in the s like me you might even feel like you were in that apartment willy clearly has been living there too long he s sleeping in front of the television when the kettle in the other room boils willy wakes up and picks up the phone hello who is this a pause never mind it s the tea old men living alone can be sad material in almost anyone else s hands but simon s deft wit and unerring feeling for character turns this adaptation of his stage hit into comedy gold the amazing thing about the sunshine boys is how much it rubs your noses in willy s almost existential condition without turning you off at all years old and just like that he dies of nothing willy says of one old songwriting friend before deciding the man probably died from writing a song that rhymed lady with baby burns won an oscar for his understated performance as the gentle but steely lewis but it s matthau who brings this one home his make up and proud but ragged bearing really selling you on the idea he was already when he made this willy is obnoxious in the extreme fully deserving ben s description crazy freakin old man but you root for him throughout enjoying his small victories even when they come at the cost of others patience his lines kill you too especially when he s trying to kill lewis for whom the tv reunion turns out to be a bad idea you re out of touch willy tells lewis at one point i m still in demand i m still hot if this room was on fire you wouldn t be hot lewis replies director herbert ross shoots everything in a very casual and understated way with low lighting and mid range shots even in emotional moments so as to leave room for the comedy and the film s overall zen message of grace through quiet acceptance you never get the feeling you are watching a movie one of the sunshine boys many charms and ross s direction like the acting of the three principals goes a long way toward achieving that end comedy is hard especially when the subjects are people watching life pass them by but the sunshine boys makes it all seem a pleasure because for us watching it is
this film is very interesting i have seen it twice and it seems glover hit the nail on the head with what he claims to he wants to accomplish i for one can relate to the outrage that the filmmaker clearly expresses against the current thoughtless corporate drivel that is an onslaught in our every media center and the things that we as a culture are supposed to not think about due to corporate media control the outrage that glover expresses through the outrageous elements in the films is both clear in its visceral aggressiveness and beautiful in its poetic potency i am glad i saw this film and it is even clearer that glover is up to something interesting with part two of what will be a trilogy it is fine everything is fine see that also people that dismiss this film as thoughtless or pretentious are really missing the boat this is an intelligent films if you can see it with his live show he performs before with his books that is also very wroth while the way you get in to his mindset is really something you will have an experience
i spotted this movie in the video store a few years ago and rented it my husband and i enjoyed it so much we bought the vhs and have enjoyed it ever since the plot has been well discussed so no need in going over it again the point is this movie deserves repeated viewings americans especially aren t going to get all the jokes the first time around i know i didn t this movie is funny touching sad all at the same time when ray proposes the toast at his daughter s wedding it s cringe inducing when karen calls tony brian as he attempts to kiss her it s heartbreaking when beano is finally cornered by the woman in black it s too funny for words and the music it s as good as any movie soundtrack i ve heard in years i was dancing in the living room to all over the world every performance is absolutely perfect bill nighy has been justly complimented for his portrayal of ray a man who has had one too many bad trips stephen rea is perfect as tony the lovable keyboard player who has carried a torch for karen all these years he has an appealing hangdog look that makes women want to hug him but all the actors are equally brilliant ignore any pans you read about this movie and see it it s a gem
if you are looking for a definitive biography of the life of boxer james corbett then this is probably not the film for you the famed boxer receives a s hollywood ization of his life making the story far more entertaining and engaging than real life however because the performances were so good particularly by errol flynn and the script so likable the film s embellishments can be forgiven errol flynn plays gay nineties era boxer james gentleman jim corbett a man who became world boxing champ in the film goes from his rather humble beginnings and follows his through his career through him winning the title match against john l sullivan however while it could have focused mostly on the matches most are rather brief in the film except for the final title match and the emphasis is on corbett s brash personality as well as his relationship with the lady played by alexis smith throughout the film there is excellent supporting work done by a cast of wonderful supporting actors such as the perennial supporting actor in flynn films alan hale and the writing really helped bring these people alive what is particularly nice about the film is seeing the athleticism of flynn as a boxer while a few of the shots are of doubles almost all the boxing scenes are of flynn and he did a convincing job as a pugilist this was a nice departure for flynn who generally played pretty boy roles or swashbucklers and this shows just how tough a character he was to find out more about this try reading a biography of him he was quite the rough and tumble character before coming to hollywood now as for the real james corbett read on if you aren t afraid of finding out how the movie isn t accurate first corbett was not a poor guy coming from a poor family but was college educated and bright second while he did get alexis smith at the end of the film they also divorced a few years later third the wonderfully touching final scene of the film between sullivan and corbett was probably the best part of the film sullivan was a jerk and this never could have happened in reality sullivan was more the egomaniac and corbett was not the fat headed guy they portrayed in the film though it made for a lovely film
unlike tinseltown s version of hello dolly jay presson allen s screen adaptation of ira levin s hit broadway thriller couldn t wait for it s stage incarnation to shutter before putting it up on the silver screen so producers wisely decided to make the most of it s lengthy white way run the film s opening and closing scenes are shot inside new york s intimate music box theater where deathtrap played for nearly five years even the film s final fadeout on the theatre marquee is a version of the stageplay s famous logo although marketeers decided to go with a more fun rubik s cube icon for the movie now on a low priced dvd release deathtrap seems just as fresh and inventinve as ever the cast is just right better than their stage counterparts and location scouts should be applauded for finding a suitably spooky house for our one room two act thriller to take place in opened up in surprisingly simple and innovative ways director sidney lumet wisely tags any new material onto the beginning and end of the film and leaves levin s wickedly twisty center alone the film s last scene is a major hollywood departure from the boards and slightly undermines one of levin s plot points from earlier in the film helga about a dagger will be used by another woman because of play like robert altman s the player however our new finale helps the film fold in on itself once again and blurs the lines between stage screen and could it be real life
i ve often wondered just how much casper was meant for children with all the issues revolving around his identity in this film we are lead to believe that he is the spirit of a dead child as his home is a cemetery plot as well as the disturbing message brought by this particular film maybe casper was meant more as a morality play or famous studios felt like breaking new ground in reality cartoons there s good boos tonight is a well animated project no doubt there but the plot development involving the fox who becomes casper s friend but meets a tragic end is a concern give famous studios credit they tackle death with respect but the stark image of casper s mourning is rather graphic and disturbing for children though the denouement does offer a happy ending but i won t give away the ending and the violence is rather steep even for s standards this might be a good cartoon for parents to use in helping explain death to children but i wouldn t pop it into the vcr for a perky cartoon break
jim carrey is back to much the same role that he played in the mask a timid guy who is trying to get ahead in the world but who seems to be plagued with bad luck even when he tries to help a homeless guy from being harassed by a bunch of hoodlums and of course they have to be mexican obviously his good will towards his fellow man backfires in that case it wasn t too hard to predict that he was about to have a handful of angry hoodlums but i like that the movie suggests that things like that shouldn t be ignored i m reminded of the episode of michael moore s brilliant the awful truth when they had a man lay down on the sidewalk and pretend to be dead and see who would actually stop and make sure he was okay the results were not very promising so it s nice to see someone in the movies setting a good example jim carrey plays the part of bruce nolan the nice guy mentioned above whose entire life seems to be falling apart or even better it seems to be breaking up by the blows of bad luck like an asteroid entering the atmosphere a little metaphor that comes up when bruce miraculously finds himself a gigantic news story later in the film bruce is nearly years old and all he has to show for it is a position as a news reporter of the sort that reports on such exciting news as the local bakery that s seeking to bake the world s biggest cookie he s desperate to obtain the job of head anchor at the tv station but he loses his cool on live tv when he hears that the job went to his rival colleague you have to love how they time the revelation of this news to him seconds before his first live report needless to say he loses his temper on live tv in one of the funniest scenes of the entire film morgan freeman delivers a fantastic performance as the man himself displaying a god whose infinite wisdom is somewhat reflected through freeman s massive talent as an actor he is the kind of god who takes his job very seriously but in such a way as to advise his followers as well as the viewers of this movie that there are times when you need to slow down and do some manual labor in life i love his line that some of the happiest people in the world come home smelling to high heaven at the end of the day there are a lot of people in the world maybe more than our share in america who are so absorbed by their money and their possessions and their jobs and everything that they completely lost touch with the natural side of themselves as humans one of the biggest strengths is that the movie is able to provide great advice to people in general about improving their lives and this message is clear and acceptable regardless of the viewer s religion i for example tend to reject organized religion in all forms and i see god and satan to be metaphors for different aspects of nature and human psychology rather than actual figures who ever lived or continue to live but despite the fact that i don t believe that god exists as an entity overseeing the universe or as a janitor dressed all in white who mops the floors of his downtown office in his spare time i was able to appreciate the messages that were delivered in this movie jim carrey s movies display this fantastic evolution that ties them all together and makes the newer ones look even better just because you can see how far he s come if you compare bruce almighty with movies like ace ventura both of which i loved by the way or a lot of what he did before he got into film it s amazing how far he s come he has moved from cheesy tv comedy to cheesy comedic films to comedies that are truly intelligent and meaningful like this film as well as others like the truman show man on the moon and the majestic easily one of his greatest films ever jim carrey has unmistakably moved from the cheesy comedy of his past to become one of the most important comic actors working today jennifer aniston also once again provides an excellent addition to the movie as she did in the side splitting office space as bruce s girlfriend who becomes increasingly exasperated by bruce s growing stress about his life as well as his negligence to ask her to marry him there is definitely some low brow comedy in the film that doesn t really fit with the importance of the film s meaning or the quality of the delivery such as the dog reading the newspaper on the toilet and the whole monkey scene but it was definitely pretty nice to see ace ventura s friend spike make a cameo appearance as stephen king very well knows it s always nice to see familiar characters it s almost like seeing family again bruce is endowed with the powers of god for a given period of time so that he can understand life a bit better and he says a lot about himself when he uses the powers only for his own purposes rather than to help all of the people who pray to him the thing i love about this is that like i said before religion is absent from my life but i was able to watch this and learn a lot about myself as well by thinking about what kinds of things i would have done had i been endowed with such powers the movie allows us to learn vicariously this way which empowers the message even more the scenes that involve the news station are easily the funniest in the entire film such as the scene when bruce loses his temper about the anchor position the jimmy hoffa scene who was conveniently buried with an original birth certificate and a complete set of dental records the scene where bruce s rival colleague is made to go nuts on camera and my favorites the ones at the beginning and the end involving the local bakery s cooking the movie has plenty of time for carrey to deliver some excellent jokes such as when he says to god who reveals that he s the janitor the proprietor the electrician etc that his christmas parties must be real bashes and to be careful about drinking because on of him might need a ride home i also loved the end when he says that behind every great man is a woman rolling her eyes a little too true and as gallagher would add behind every great man is also an amazed mother in law bruce almighty is one of the more memorable comedies to have come out for quite a while and is probably the only directly religious that i can remember seeing that i am anxious to buy on dvd to add to my personal collection it is a comedy written and performed in good taste but with enough relatively low brow humor to keep the kids entertained this is a meaningful comedy for the whole family which is becoming rarer and rarer these days in a world that is about to be flogged with yet another american pie film and another scary movie which are only scary because of their sheer barbarous idiocy it s nice to see that there are still people making comedies worth watching don t miss this one
i saw that when i was little and it was excellent kelsey white as lisa and the meecy mices where cute susan bonde as doodle and sandra dee heidecke as snoodle where hilarius karen boettcher tate as profster was interesting burl ross as little bunny foo foo was funny gregory donavon as kaiso was brilliant whats hilarius that snoodle and doodle eat too much candy whats sad that little bunny foo foo that bops the meecy mices on the head then by a fairy will give little bunny foo foo few wishes then he turns into goon this story is about when lisa snoodle doodle go to the big rock candy mountains this show is excellent the kids will like this show new words songs and watching them playing
i first saw this film when i was about years old on tv in the uk where it was called laupta the flying island i absolutely loved it and was heartbroken when it was repeated a while later and i missed it i was enchanted by the story and characters but most of all by the haunting and beautiful music it would have been the original english dubbed version which i saw sometimes erroneously referred to as the streamline dub the dub was actually by ghibli themselves and only distributed by streamline which is sadly unavailable except as part of a ridiculously expensive laser disc box set unfortunately i feel that the release has been partly spoiled by disney the voice acting is ok but the dialogue doesn t have the same raw energy that the streamline dub or the original japanese had and i think james van der beek sounds too old to play the lead they have made some pointless alterations such as changing the main character s name from pazu to patzu and added some dialogue but worst of all i feel that they have ruined many scenes with intrusive music the opening scene of the airships for example was originally silent but has been spoiled thanks to disney s moronic requirement that there be music playing whenever anyone is not speaking which i find annoying in many disney films this film still blows away most recent animated films and i cannot recommend it highly enough the plot is simple yet captivating and the film shows a flair which is sadly missing from most modern mass market homogenized animation
and i really mean that i caught it last night on vh and i was not expecting it to be so good this is now one of my favorites i must add that it has a killer soundtrack
following the brilliant goy kiba aka hanzo the razor sword of justice and its excellent and even sleazier sequel goy kiba kamisori hanz jigoku zeme aka razor the snare this goy kiba oni no hanz yawahada koban aka razor who s got the gold is the third and sadly final installment to the awesome saga about the incorruptible samurai constable hanzo the razor ittami brilliantly played by the great shintar katsu who fights corruption with his fighting expertise as well as his enormous sexual powers as a big fan of s exploitation cinema made in nippon sword of justice became an instant favorite of mine and i was therefore more than eager to find the sequels and full of anticipation when i finally stumbled over them recently while this third hanzo film is just not quite as brilliant as its predecessors it is definitely another great piece of cult cinema that no lover of japanese exploitation cinema can afford to miss who s got the gold is a bit tamer than the two foregoing hanzo films but it is just as brilliantly comical and crudely humorous and immediately starts out fabulously odd the film begins when hanzo s two assistants see a female ghost when fishing having always wanted to sleep with a ghost hanzo insists that his assistants lead him to the site of the occurrence if that is not a promising beginning for an awesome film experience i don t know what is shintaro katsu one of my personal favorite actors is once again brilliant in the role of hanzo a role that seems to have been written specifically for him katsu is hanzo the obstinate and fearless constable who hates corruption and deliberately insults his superiors and whose unique interrogation techniques include raping female suspects the interrogated women than immediately fall for him due to his sexual powers and enormous penis which he trains in a rather grotesque routine ritual i will not give away more about the plot in who s got the gold but i can assure that it is as cool as it sounds the supporting performances are also very good and as in the predecessors there are plenty of hilariously eccentric characters this is sadly the last film in the awesomely sleazy hanzo series if they had made sequels more i would have happily watched them all the entire hanzo series is brilliant and while this third part is a bit inferior compared to its predecessors it is definitely a must see for all lovers of cult cinema oh how i wish they had made more sequels
what a pleasant surprise a disney dtv direct to video sequel that s actually good the lion king is a comedy affair that involves everyone s favorite meerkat and warthog timon and pumbaa it starts out with them watching the original movie and making comments until timon complains that we re not here yet after fighting over the remote timon and pumbaa decide to tell the audience their story they start the new movie and the laughs begin to be honest i was losing hope in disney most of their direct to video fare has been aggressively awful with the story lines desperate to cash in on the original decides to try something different it tells the original story from a new point of view okay it adds some stuff like where timon came from and how he and pumbaa met but it s an interesting concept nathan lane and ernie sabella perfectly recapture the bond and friendship that made us love them in the first movie there s also some neat movie parodies including one scene that simultaneously spoofs the good the bad and the ugly and cool hand luke and the script is filled with funny memorable lines added to the cast are julie kavner the simpsons as timon s worry wart mom and jerry stiller as timon s slightly crazy uncle max matthew broderick shows up as simba and his teen scene reminded me of ferris bueller everyone does well especially robert guillame is that how you spell it as rafiki who exudes more and more yoda speak in this movie timon comments on this several times the lion king is a perfect alternate choice for those of you getting tired of the shrekification of animation
hi i heard about lost from a co worker that had obvious differences of opinion on entertainment he loved it well i watched an episode or in the early seasons and was bored so i tuned it out after a few years i stumbled upon lost bored with the current sci fi fare wow was i surprised can you say gravity well damn i got sucked in the pace and scripting are very good some of the flash forward backs are so so with the lamer characters but over all good my favorite characters are ben locke jacob richard alpert sayid jarrah sawyer hurley daniel faraday jin wife walt charlie desmond and jack s dad jack and michael definitely are immature asshats very spoiled and immature kate step above them juliet was way more classy than kate mr eko way under rated and on the level of charlie if not more too bad they both died the guy dressed in black talking to jacob way back is a genuine curiosity as a whole great very layered series looking for more regards
it is always a nice suprise when a film made for tv turns out to be entertaining such as little richard this is a very watchable film about the story of rock and roller little richard played by an actor called leon who i have never seen before but does an very good job as most tv films this is a little tamer than if made for cinema which is a shame because i am sure there is lot we could have seen about little richard that was controversial instead we see a lot religous rubbish which is the only thing that spoils the film and eventually spoilt a very promising career all in all this film is good and the acting is above average fot a tv film out of
the message of a world on the brink of war is disregarded by the masses the mythical city of everytown in represents england in general but it could just as well stand for any nation of the world when war finally does arrive it s ravages continue not for another five years but until at which time everytown is completely destroyed adding to the desolation and toll on humanity is the wandering sickness a pestilence that continues for another four years things to come balances both a fatalistic and futuristic world view where science holds out a hope for a revived civilization the wings over the world concept plays out a bit corny though it s spokesman cabal raymond massey is unwavering in his mission and dedicated to his cause if he fails others will follow this message is continually reinforced throughout the film brought home convincingly in massey s end of movie speech man s insatiable need to test the limits of knowledge and achievement requires an all the universe or nothing mindset the film s imagery of automation and machinery in the second half is reminiscent of the great silent film metropolis as everytown is rebuilt and transformed by the year the spectacle of the city s rebirth strikes a resonant chord as architecture of modern cities of today suggest the movie s eerily prophetic vision is coming to fruition where the movie gets it wrong by sixty seven years though is man s first mission to the moon but in a hundred year timetable probably seemed more legitimate than things to come is one of those rarities in film a picture that makes you think which side will you come down on the forces for advancement in the face of uncertainty or maintain the status quo it s not a comfortable question as both choices offer inherent dangers and unknowable outcomes those who choose to be bystanders risk being swept away by forces beyond their control
after a big tip of the hat to spinal tap this movie is hilarious anyone who grew up watching mtv will love it and if you didn t rent it anyway the my peanuts and a gangster s life videos are worth the three bucks alone
the s tv series bewitched owes it s idea from this movie this is the movie that jimmy stewart kim novak made right after they were cast together in vertigo by alfred hitchcock this one is not as obsessive as that one but novak is just as captivating this was jack lemmons th movie and he is good in support here as well as ernie kovacs the movie has a lot of good things about it hermine gingold is very good in this movie almost as good in support here as she was in the music man the cast is very solid this movie has a late s new york city feel a cat that is as hexing as any feline in any movie it is well worth watching as it is a love story with all the emotion of any a little magic too boot it is not vertigo but i think because it followed that movie viewers then did not rate it as good as it deserved sure am glad that william asher saw it so that the s series got created i am not so glad about what will ferrell did to it on the big screen this movie is much better than that
robert jannuci luca venantini venantino venantini alicia moro two stars are from city of the living dead i wonder what luca is doing these days probably a lawyer or something like bela lugosi jr or david hennessey there kid from dark shadows who wants to forget dark shadows existed anyway in the thorn emi video there s no music over the opening credits but the music is great once it comes in with the italian movies the films aren t as good as the music my favorite scene is with the boy with the robot arm following loner alien through the desert alien says why are you following me tommy answers because i feel like it alien replies which way are you headed tommy says west then alien says well i m going east so after a while of walking the theme playing in the background alien looks up and sees tommy sitting on a rock petting a pet hamster tommy looks up and says to alien what took you so long i love this movie it touches my heart the boy with the robot arm needs a daddy and alien is drafted in to being tommy s daddy in the desert oh yeah they need water too not the road warrior mad max by any means but a silly western post nuke movie with a boy with a robot arm and alien and trash and a few other good guys with a mean chick with an iron claw and crazy bull who looks like wez in the road warrior on sunday afternoons on channel philadelphia pa after church i d come home and find this on often too often love it
super slick entertainment with a stellar cast an outstanding script and a firm grip on the approaching s at the time rko was turning out classic noirs by the dozens but whatever the value of those shadowy downers they reflected a war time mood soon to give way the sunnier climes of the eisenhower era few films of the late s are further from that noir cycle or more attuned to the coming consumer decade than this sassy little comedy jim blandings cary grant works as an ad man on madison ave where in his little daughter s words he sells things to people that they don t need at prices they can t afford he s making good money but like thousands of others he s tired of living in a cramped urban cave so with wife myrnah loy they strike out after their dream house in the wilds of the connecticutt countryside needless to say in the arms of nature they get more than they bargained for and in hilarious fashion there s hardly a lifeless line in the entire script i don t know if writers panama and frank got an oscar but they should have of course the humor revolves around all the problems that pop up when city people build a big house on rural land the annoyances pile up almost as fast as the mortgage with all the eccentric types running the construction show and giving grant a hard time of course no one carries off annoyance or frustration more humorously than grant so it s just one well placed laugh after another particularly when the locked closet appears to have an infernal mind of its own yet oddly the film appears to have no comedic high point instead the laughs are spaced out so expertly that they don t peak at any particular point that s a real movie triumph for any era reaching back years later we can see how deftly the script ideas look ahead rather than behind with their live in maid the blandings may not be a typical american family but that post war migration from cramped cities to spacious suburbia was typical and what more suggestive job for the coming consumerism than blandings as an ad man tasked with finding catchier ways to sell more ham more than anything however there s the movie s sunny optimism oh sure the feeling falters at times yet the belief that a better future is on the horizon if the blandings just stick to their dream carries them through indeed life was going to improve for a lot of people during the coming surge so i expect the film resonated deeply with audiences of the day it s that easily over looked subtext along with the sheer entertainment value that makes this movie a key comedy statement of the post war period so if you haven t seen it catch it next time around
and i gave it a high why because it bloody well rocked at the time when there were so many other shows on that were tied to toys games this show was unique in that it had overlapping stories as others have said here it was ahead of its time sadly this is why the show was doomed they have released dvds with episodes of the series so far i am hoping that more come out how does this compare watching it now years after it first came out i don t know i still like it despite the sometimes clunky animation and that imho is it s only flaw the writing was almost top notch and way ahead of the competition i do hope for more dvds or even a set of all the episodes in proper order the dvds are good but i don t think the stories are in their proper order but despite this the show rocked
that movie was awesome i can t get over it s songs i think i m a little too old for musicals but that movie deserves some credit here guys my especial favorite was jack wild me being a british actor lover you can t restrain me from all those nice looking fresh faced young men i never knew that when jack was doing that movie he was sixteen he looks like an eleven year old he s short that s what helps try posting up your replies fellow posters so i can relate to your experiences oh and about oliver reed that guy bill sikes i think that drone look is really familiar any idea where he s starred in before if so post it up i d really like to know
the original vampires is one of my favorites i was curious to see how a sequel would work considering they used none of the original characters i was quite surprised at how this played out as a rule sequels are never as good as the original with a few exceptions though this one was not a great movie the writer did well in keeping the main themes vampire lore from the first one in tact jon bon jovi was a drawback initially but he proved to be a half way decent slayer i doubt anyone could top james wood s performance in the first one though unless you bring in buffy all in all this was a decent watch i would watch it again i was left with two questions though what happened to jack crow how did derek bliss come to be a slayer guess we ll just have to leave that to imagination
emilio miraglio s the red queen kills seven times is just about the most perfect example of a giallo that i have ever seen mixing all the requisite elements into one sinister stew indeed first of all and of paramount importance for me it has a complex twisty plot that ultimately makes perfect sense and the killer here does not come completely out of left field at the end the story concerning a series of gruesome murders you already know how many from the film s title right that takes place in seeming fulfillment of an ancient prophecy concerning two sisters is an involving one and the murderer a red cloaked figure with the insane laugh of a madwoman is both frightening and memorable every great giallo requires some lovely lead actresses and here we have quite an assortment headed by the ridiculously beautiful barbara bouchet as one of the two sisters and in one of her earlier roles sybil danning as a lustful tramp at barbara s fashion house another necessary ingredient of a superior giallo is a catchy hummable score and bruno nicolai provides one for this film that should stay with you for days gorgeous scenery check again filmed largely in wurzburg germany the picture is a treat for the eye indeed ok ok but what about those murders after all isn t that what gialli are all about well i m pleased to report that most viewers should be well satisfied with the various knifings shootings impalements and other carnage that this film tastefully dishes out not to mention the crypts freaky dream sequence rats and bats and lots of em too the drug references a rape scene the obligatory red herrings and in the person of ugo pagliai a hunky leading man for the female viewers as i said a perfect giallo and even better this dvd is from the fine folks at no shame and you know what that means a gorgeous print and loads of extras to boot thanks guys
mcconaughey in a horror thriller i had to see this i was pleasantly surprised the plot is told in flashback mode and it concerns an otherwise normal and happy family of three going through a very bizarre predicament i can t say much more without spoiling the whole movie sorry just know that if you decide to watch it you ll be in the very least surprised all the main players are very good bill paxton did a great job directing those kids and his acting is awesome mcconaughey s acting is solid throughout and fits the bill perfectly this movie challenges you to think is dad crazy is there a god do demons exist how far would you go to right a wrong and what is right anyway i m still thinking and thus i recommend frailty and this is one of those movies that deserves and rewards a second or even third viewing
i stopped short of giving mr blandings builds his dream house due to an aspect that makes us in the st century cringe a little bit the fact that a black person is the faithful servant somewhat reminiscent of stepin fetchit but other than that the movie s a hoot portraying middle class new york couple jim cary grant and muriel blandings myrna loy trying to build a house in connecticut this flick has something for everyone grant is his usual flippant self while loy does quite well as merely a wife but melvyn douglas adds some real laughs as jim s and muriel s lawyer bill cole who seems to have more plans than he s making clear as for the house itself throughout most of the movie you ll probably feel ambiguous as to whether or not you want to live there the builders contractors and others also provide their fair share of laughs all in all a comedy classic also starring louise beavers reginald denny sharyn moffett connie marshall and jason robards sr
this is far more than the charming story of middle aged man discovering the pleasures of ballroom dancing although it is that as well it s the tale of one person learning to love life again pushing past all the pressures of work and money to discover joy once more the bonus in this film is a fascinating insight into the slowly changing attitudes of modern japan toward everything from ballroom dancing to physical contact there are scenes that will make you laugh out loud a few where you ll want to get up and tango and many others where you ll just feel good this is a great introduction to contemporary japanese filmmaking for those who might be under the impression that all japanese movies are heavy and inaccessible
the movie was totally awesome and cool the graphics was superb and it was amazing especially flik was superb and awesome in the movie and he was funny and he was and sometimes he was intelligent the circus bugs are colorful and they are superb in the movie the grasshoppers were also superb and cool in the movie hopper was a pure and perfect villain even dot was cute when the bird comes to eat the bugs that scene was superb and good even the last scene was awesome and cool even flik s inventions was good building an artificial bird was a good idea to scare away the grasshoppers when the ants are building the artificial bird that scene was good and nice i should really appreciate the creators of a bug s life
i m a rather pedestrian person with somewhat lowbrow tastes however i occasionally try to raise the bar on my cultural awareness this movie was one of my attempts i was in awe throughout the entire movie i liked it so much that i got my own tape so i could see it again this is a very thoughtful and emotionally striking movie i saw it as a huge question to the viewer what is the depth of sacrifice to duty one can accept can be asked to accept should accept as a military member this is of course an important question to me this question weighs heavily on the viewer of this movie recommended
this film centers on four criminals locked away in a prison who desire escape from their cell hoping that a mysterious book of black magic penned by a former inmate around named danvers who wanted to use spells to keep his skin young carr re s g rald laroche criminal business tactics shortcuts have landed him in prison with three oddball cell mates a transsexual brute marcus clovis cornillac marcus love toy p querette dimitri rataud who eats objects he touches and is in prison for eating his six month old sister and obeys his charge as if he were his mother and the scholarly lassalle philippe laudenbach who doesn t read or eat breakfast the latter being that he murdered his wife during that time of the day the film follows carr re as he reads from the book attempting to understand it s meanings hoping to find an exit from his prison carr re loves his child and for a while believes his wife will get him out early on bail when she betrays him carr re begins to slowly seethe with hate and longing to see and hold his beloved son carr re s toughest critic is marcus who longs to be fully female while still folding to several masculine traits such as working out and taking a leak standing up he talks tough and uses his muscle as a type of fear tactic although deep inside is a world of vulnerability p querette is completely under marcus control and behaves like a canine to it s master there s even an alarming scene where p querette breast feeds from marcus lassalle is an unraveling mystery opening up for us to slowly understand his ulterior motives and what lies within his possibly sinister brain clearly intellectual and holding possible secrets from the others lassalle is actually the one who keeps the motivation of pursuing the secrets of the book going soon those who aren t a threat to the book seek their true escape not as much from the cell of four walls but the cell that imprisons their true desires after a certain murder the book is thrown from the room with a very fascinating character entering the film with a camcorder as if he were a new occupant who is this person and how does he understand the power of a book tosses away and better yet how to use it a constant in this film is each of the prisoners often seen throughout looking out their window into the world just out of reach i m glad i had a chance to watch this film it does play out like monkey s paw the characters get what they desire but a price must be met there s gore in the film startling moments of graphic violence but in my opinion this is first and foremost a story driven tale the gore is a product of what the book unleashes one of the group gets his limbs twisted while suspended in the air while a grisly opening act displays the carnage left in the wake of one man s desire we see danver s fate at the end with a magnificent special effects sequence regarding an infant melting away lassalle s fate is a masterful effects sequence i will say that mal fique through eric valette s well paced direction always kept my attention and for being such an isolated movie about of the film takes place in a singular location the prison cell it never seems to drag i guess that s a testament to interesting actors and fascinating characterizations not to mention a compelling story using the supernatural to drive them
i really enjoyed this movie it took a pretty dark story that of shakespeare s macbeth and wrapped it in a quirky often funny and poignant modern yarn kudos to the way the filmmaker brought the very different worlds of modern nyc and macbeth s scotland together under one roof the opposing worlds act toreally bring out the intrigue and comedy of the play and you have to love harold perrineau as the chorus a part which doesn t exist in the play but really helps to jazz things up the ending stands out among little indies i ve seen for it s closure and originality
this film would usually classify as the worst movie production ever ever but in my opinion it is possibly the funniest the horrifying direction and screenplay makes this film priceless i bought the movie whilst sifting through the bargain dvd s at my local pound shop me and some friends then watched it admittedly whilst rather drunk it soon occurred that this wasn t any normal film instead a priceless relic of what will probably be james cahill s last film at first we were confused and were screaming for the dvd player to be turned off but thankfully in our abnormal state no one could be bothered instead we watched the film right through at the end we soon realised we had found any wasters dream something that you can acceptably laugh at for hours whilst laughing for all the wrong reasons we soon showed all our other friends and they too agreed this wasn t a work of abysmal film this was a film that you can truly wet yourself laughing at this was a film that anyone can enjoy this was genius
interesting mix of comments that it would be hard to add anything constructive to however i ll try this was a very good action film with some great set pieces you ll note i specified the genre i didn t snipe about the lack of characterisation and i didn t berate the acting enjoy if for what it is people a well above average action film i could go on but i ve made my comment
well what can i say this movie really got to me it s not so bad as many say i really loved it although the idea seems so simple and rather boring it isn t first of all i enjoyed the soundtrack bryan adams it really goes with the movie second the simple story and the drama of spirit gets your attention one thing i like the most is that they didn t give the stallion a human voice to interact with the other horses it makes the movie more realistic not many animations seem realistic now do they but i don t know making animals talk is just so lame one of the most beautiful animations of in my opinion i recommend it to everyone not just the kids because it is very relaxing
albuquerque is a film that has all the elements of a class a western except one the story that really belongs to a class b or c that was acceptable at the time the film was made when people were so thrilled to see a western in color but nowadays it just looks very primitive nonetheless for people who enjoy old westerns it is entertaining the original color and sound are very well kept on the dvd that recently came out gabby hayes is a good sidekick lon chaney is mean as always and randolph scott a bit more cheerful than usual in a film named albuquerque you would expect to see something that would remind you of the city but the town that is shown here could be just anywhere
i read the book and saw the movie both excellent the movie is diamond among coals during this era liebman and selby dominate the screen and communicate the intensity of their characters without flaw this film should have made them stars shame on the studio for not putting everything they had behind this film it could have easily been a franchise release on dvd is a must and a worthy remake would revive this film look for it in your tv guide and if you see it listed no matter how late watch it you won t be disappointed do yourself another favor read the book same title it ll blow you away times have changed dramatically since those days or at least we like to think they have
there is no director i like more than mamoru oshii but sadly even though he directed quite a few films that gained huge international attention there are still a fair few of his films that have slipped through the cracks tachiguishi is one of them and even though i loved it to bits it s not hard to see why distributors in the west are somewhat reluctant to release it in between his big and serious films oshii is known to do some smaller and quirkier projects while tachiguishi definitely falls into this category oshii has really outdone himself with this one creating something that is very hard to classify even as a freaky japanese flick go figure at its very core lies a documentary not quite unlike otaku no video but rather than make a fool of an existing subculture oshii invents his own and delves into the lives of culinary heroes scrounging away food for free and upholding the japanese culinary level oshii s approach on the subject has close ties with dai nipponjin as the subject is handled with a deadly sense of gravity while the images on screen look as ridiculous as can be deadpan humor taken to the extreme but that is not all rather than simply shooting his mockumentary oshii decided to make it using a new visual technique baptized superlivemation a weird mix of live action photography digital animation and puppets on a stick performed and acted out or posed if you want by the greats of the japanese animation industry no less as the project was supposed to be as low budget as possible and if you think that just about covers it know that the film is extremely dialogue heavy making it a good companion piece for innocence the influence of the grifters is analyzed from all kinds of cultural political and even philosophical angles fired at the audience through a continuous stream of monologues and dialogues and to make it even worse the whole film is completely grounded in actual japanese history and customs making it even harder for a foreigner to get a good grip on the material needless to say multiple viewings are advised to make the best of all the details tucked away inside the film that said on a conceptual level the film is easy to follow and already pretty hilarious various grifters are introduced as were they the most influential historical figures of post war japan the film plays like you d expect a serious documentary of any other important figure to unfold but somehow the big and crudely animated cut out photography limbs of which figures are assembled don t quite make it all that serious the range of characters introduced is sublime shinji higuchi taking the cake as cow creature wearing a nose ring while taking on the fast food chains with his gang of bull people oshii regular kenji kawai provides besides a pretty comical performance a score ranging from atmospheric and dark to wacky strange and comical a lot of fun is to be had from the exaggerated noises and effects complementing the animation and totally contradicting the tone of the rest of the film visually the film is very atmospheric though it must be said that the animation is pretty scarce and while effective remains toned down only to burst out in hyperactive weirdness from time to time which is not exactly a bad thing seeing how tachiguishi is so dialogue heavy despite that the film is still a visual masterpiece as each frame looks absolutely lush and is tailored to match and improve the general atmosphere of the film beware though because tachiguishi does demand a lot from the viewer if you don t speak japanese there is a lot of reading to be done and there are many cultural references that demand some attention on top of that the monologues in the film area quite extended and can be hard to follow the film still lacks english subtitles and even though my french was largely sufficient to get what it was all about i m sure i missed many of the finer points of the film tachiguishi is not an easy film to get into but around halfway through it reaches full steam and it doesn t let off from there on i still hope to see this one again with english or dutch subs a dub would actually be best for a film like this much like container though i guess a quality anime dub is a bit too much to ask for with all of that said i can only congratulate oshii on another marvelous film it s rare to find a film that blends and mixes so many styles and influences to create something that is so unique and still works the film is smart looks and sounds great and is filled to the brim with creativity it is immensely funny even if you can t catch all the details on the first viewing but be sure to at least get this with decent subs as the automated english translation that is floating out there is completely worthless and does the film no justice at all tachiguishi caters to a very specific audience and i m not surprised the french got their release while the rest of europe and the rest of the western world is still waiting for a sign of this film but for those that like oshii appreciate dry and deadpan humor and crave creative spirits it is a film that cannot be missed even though it could just as well misfire
louis creed a doctor from chicago moves to a large house near a small town since he is going to be giving classes in the university of maine s along with him is his wife rachel and their two kids ellie and gage as well as ellie s cat church soon they met their new neighbor and old man named judd crandall judd not only warns louis and rachel about the danger that is the highway that runs past their house that is constantly a way used by big trucks but also show to the family a pet cemetery that is located near their house judd starts to talk about the importance of the pet cemetery but rachel is against to talk about death and spirituality with her children since she has traumas from her sister zelda s death during the first week of the family in the new house louis already has dead people to deal with victor pascow a student who has been fatally injured in an automobile accident addresses his dying words to louis personally even though the two men are strangers on the night following pascow s death louis experiences what he believes is a very vivid dream in which he meets pascow who leads him to the pet cemetery and warns louis to not go beyond no matter how much you feel you need to louis wakes up in bed the next morning convinced it was only a dream until he discovers his feet and the bedsheets covered with dirt and pine needles anyway he dismisses the dream many strange things starts to happen and church ellie s cat dies while walking on the highway louis stays worried in how he is going to talk about church s death with ellie but judd sympathizing with him jud takes louis to the pet cemetery supposedly to bury church but instead of stopping there jud leads louis farther on a frightening journey to the real cemetery an ancient burial ground that was once used by the micmac indians there louis buries the cat on jud s instruction with jud saying that animals buried there have come back to life and that is where the real horror story begins i personally find this movie very good it s not the most horrifying of all but it is one of the best horror movies i watched the way gage dies is almost impossible to not stay in your memory specially being a toddler it s cool to see stephen king s cameo as the minister of the funeral of course there are some script errors how can a rich doctor with two small kids goes to live in a place where there is a dangerous highway near his house how gage has no scratches or anything after being hit by a truck why louis continues to resurrect every member of his family knowing they are all going to stay like monsters things like that doesn t make any sense but i can understand that all horror s scripts needs to have some surreal ideas to work a good thing i saw in this movie is the necessity to talk about death with the children no matter what is your religion or if you are an atheist and also that avoiding important subjects doesn t help anything because of louis being afraid to be honest with ellie confronting her and saying that her cat wouldn t be back again all the nightmare began
bravo to czechs their once powerful movie industry seems to awaken from post communist slumber the loners is a comedy done with all the elements you would expect to see in a modern hollywood production minus the garbage that seems to get attached to the genre over the past several years superb soundtrack excellent visual editing beautiful prague cityscape to mention but a few the story is actually comprised of several sub stories that frequently intertwain and overlap an is in essence a collage of destinies fates desires it follows a group of urban youth to mid thirties people through a variety of situations ranging from daily life and leisure activities to careers and obsessions and it is hillarious there s actually a point in the movie where the entire theatre i was in about a people in a small art gallery laughed non stop for about seconds how often do you experience that with modern hollywood productions although the entire main cast is excellent especially the upcoming macedonian star labina mitevska in the role of an immigrant facing the all too familiar hardships i have to single out jiri machacek for his superbly believeable portrayal of jakub a constantly stoned bohemian whose brain is severely affected by the stuff he smokes landing him in a plethora of funny situations conclusion don t miss this one it s got a lot to offer
i bought the video rather late in my collecting and probably would have saved a lot of money if i bought it earlier it invariably supersedes anything else on those cosmo s moon nights cher and olympia certainly deserve their awards but this is really a flawless ensemble performance of a superb screenplay what you don t know what a cosmo s moon is
as a long standing barbra fan any posting like this will be biased that aside this film ranks as a classic it has it s flaws emphasized in other postings but gives a glimpse of a time late s that will never be there again and is fascinating to watch unfold on screen streisand fought hard to make this movie her own i don t think she was ever satisfied but it gives her fans a new barbra for the time with live singing a young fresh appearance and some very heavy duty acting the story is rough but exciting and holds your interest throughout the extended one frame finale is hard for most non barbra fans to sit through but it speaks volumes to those who admire her talent
i absolutely love this game to death ever since i was years old i am now it has great graphics characters magic weapons additions and don t forget the ultimately awesome dragoon forms i am still waiting for a remake prequel or a sequel to this spectacular video game you play as dart a young swordsman who has the potential to be quite the hero on this adventure you encounter wondrous creatures and boss fights you also encounter some friends on the way who have their own special element such as fire darkness water ice thunder lightning earth light and wind there are also items known as dragoon spirits which allow you to transform into magical creatures of legend dragons wizards creatures called winglies and evil creatures you ll have to face on this adventure of action packed thrills and excitement one of my all time favorite games the legend of dragoon
ok this movie was cool i don t think it was the best movie ever made but it sure was fun my brother and i still act out scenes once in a while and will occasionally yank the movie out of the cupboard blow off the dust and pop it in enjoyable all the way until the end but a great concept this is a movie that one has to just forget criticism all together and just enjoy judgment is victory for robot jox
first off anyone looking for meaningful outcome oriented cinema that packs some sort of social message with meaningful performances and soul searching dialog spoken by dedicated emotive heartfelt thespians please leave now you are wasting your time and life is short go see the new brangelina jolie movie have a good cry go out buy a hybrid car or throw away your conflict diamonds if that will make you feel better and leave us alone don t let the door hit you on the way out either the incredible melting man is a grade b minus regional horror epic shot in the wastelands of oklahoma by a young tv friendly cast crew and concerns itself with an astronaut who is exposed to bizarre radiation effects wakes up in a hospital and finds that his body is liquefying on him as he sits there feeling like a chump the melting man is played by one alex rebar who is recognizable for about the first four minutes of the film but once he starts oozin with rick baker s extraordinary special effects makeup he more resembles something you might find in a tin of spam before you drain off all the runny viscous blebs of grease the film has zero exposition and does not bandy about with plot points there are a couple of scenes involving scientist types riding around on an absurd industrial conveyor machine who dutifully recite a few obligatory lines about the effects of radiation but the movie does not care really it s a freak show and a marvelous one at that with a decidedly sick sense of humor for those who can stomach it one great laugh comes when the melting man stumbles upon a young girl in the forest and is so at a loss for what to do that one of his eyes pops out hilarious the hero of the film is played by burr debenning a fascinating character actor from the golden s s television scene who was sort of an early model for the kevin spacey prototype slightly twisted neurotic and one step ahead of most everyone in the room even if he looks confused he appeared just after this movie was made in a bizarre made for tv anthology horror piece called house of the dead or the alien zone that is regarded as one of the finest movies ever made in oklahoma which is where i suspect this film was made as well the arid cold looking rural midwestern landscapes are certainly the same and the creek that one unfortunate fly fisher chooses for his afternoon of sport appears to be the same one that cameron mitchell fought off flying alien pancakes in without warning which also had a sick sense of humor a tv friendly cast and some pretty outrageous gore i definitely sense at least an aesthetic connection between the three movies as well as the silence of the lambs which is of no surprise considering that director jonathan demme is a part of melting man s cast essentially as others have pointed out this is a s b movie plot updated for later s era special effects the inevitable boobs the movie it probably borrows most of it s ideas from is phantom from space with peter graves as an astronaut who also returns to earth after being exposed to funky radiation effects that set him off on a killing spree one of the things that i actually admire about the film is that absolutely no regard is given for the melting man s motivations he simply goes on a rampage and the movie s drama comes from wondering if he s going to fall to pieces before certain characters fall victim to his madness the budget for the film is also delightfully low and every dime spent on it is up there on the screen rick baker s disgusting effects getting the lion s share of whatever was spent on this sick disgusting fun best enjoyed with a crowd of friends and plenty of beer why can t people have made more movies like these
those who know who know the kelly legend are hoping that this film would be an accurate depiction of his life may be disappointed with the creative license taken with this film eg naomi watt s character never existed in reality but if you look at it purely as a piece of entertainment it holds up pretty well ledgers performance in the title role is quite solid taking the mantle of cinema s best ned not hard considering the previous ned s include yahoo serious mick jagger former carlton champion australian rules football bob chitty a great footballer but a poor actor some location shooting film in the area i live bacchus marsh outside melbourne as well as clunes ballarat
a great storyline with a message joan plowright is superb as phoebe mike kopsa is hilarious as coach and richard de klerk plays the role of carmine superbly mischa barton as frankie puts in a good performance and ingrid as hazel plays her first lead extremely well this film is superbly directed by jo beth williams the editing is first rate
on the night of his bachelor party paul coleman jason lee meets the gorgeous dancer becky julia stiles in the bar they drink a lot together and in the next morning he wakes up with her on the bed his future mother in law calls him and informs that his fianc e karen selma blair might be arriving in his apartment and he desperately asks becky to leave his place in a hurry sooner he finds that her has crabs and later in the preparation of his wedding dinner party he realizes that becky is the cousin of karen this is the beginning of a very funny comedy with hilarious situations the first attraction of this movie certainly is the central trio of actresses and actor julia stiles and selma blair who are excellent actresses and extremely gorgeous and jason lee who is amazingly funny have good performances i laughed a lot along the story but there are some scenes that are really hilarious for example when paul finds becky in his bed when he finds her paints his imagination in many situations in the drugstore trying to buy and get explanations about the crab medicine most of the scenes of his neighbor the minister when karen calls the department store or when the police finds a suspect of assaulting paul i could number many other scenes but better off the reader rent or buy this movie and have lots of fun my vote is seven title brazil louco por elas crazy for them
i saw this movie recently hours later my head still hurt from laughing the plot was soo awful the jokes were soo bad but what i didn t count on were the scenes before and after the movie that had pat and jay posing that caused more than enough laughter the kick through the windshield that decapitated the evil doer this movie is about times better than the rush hour series and my copy even came with a disclamer saying if you didn t like the movie send certificate to hbo while i considered it the date you had to send it in was january which also caused wackiness to ensue
i love these diaper baby movies you couldn t make a movie like this today and it is rich in cinematic history it is goofy and the film was made to make you laugh which it does how they ever got these kids to act i ll never know i think they are precious and the kids make me laugh but so do the others who made this movie as it shows the naivet that existed in the early s you have to remember that this is when the film industry was very young the stock market had crashed the world wide depression was beginning and these films were made to give a person a break from the real world the fact that you could see movies for five cents is beyond my comprehension but then dinner for cents is too it was a different time with a totally different mind set
this movie is actually funny if you d like to rest your brain for an hour so then go ahead and watch it it s called blonde and blonder so don t expect profound and meaningful jokes what this movie and enjoy all the stereotypes we have about two blondes it s just a funny movie to watch on a date or with a company of friends especially if you re not too sober lol pamela and denise are still pretty hot chicks it s a mistake to judge this movie as a piece of art c mon this movie is about blondes it s supposed to be light funny and superficial one more thing i do not think that girls will appreciate and like this movie but guy definitely will
allow yourself to be transported to a different old school kind of storytelling scoop is classic woody allen allen s latest muse scarlett johansson who also appeared in last year s match point also by allen is surprisingly able to tone down her sultry sex kitten appeal and transform into a normal looking student type with the aid of nerdish glasses and outfits but still fails to make the audience believe how hugh jackman s lordly character can be so smitten by her given the royal s background don t worry no spoilers here there are no grand transformations for johansson s character here as she consistently plays the same character throughout despite the script saying otherwise you even forgive her character s apparent lack of logic continuing an affair with a suspected serial killer simply because he is his royal hotness jackman who is refreshing to see sans the wolverine duds if anything consistency is what the year old allen is all about he continues to tell his stories on celluloid in the same way he always has as if he s never been exposed to modern film making which is probably what makes his quiet simple films appealing they never seem to aim for a specific market as if allen makes movies to his taste alone whether the public likes it or not
i just saw a press screening of this film and i was pleasantly surprised not often is it that i get to see all of my favorite actors in one film at one time i really enjoyed the pick pocket scene and it was good to see rachael bilson and hayden back together i think their chemistry on camera is a direct result of their time together off camera my favorite scene was by far surprisingly so bret ratner s piece without giving too much away i ll just say that there is a surprise that leaves you hanging the old couple were really good together and you actually got the impression that they had spent a lifetime together both the chris cooper and the ethan hawke segments packed a punch with surprises that seem realistic and similar to experiences that i ve had in the big apple over all the film is a great place to take a date especially if you re already fond of the city itself i can t wait for the next in the cities of love
joan fontaine is a damsel in distress in this musical starring fred astaire george burns and gracie allen the plot what there is of it is about a british woman fontaine in love with an american who is mistaken for astaire a musical comedy star the film directed by george stevens contains some wonderful gershwin music including nice work if you can get it and a foggy day the best scene is the stiff upper lip number which takes place in a fun house astaire s singing voice sounds more robust in this film than it does in others and he has a couple of excellent dance numbers burns plays his over the top publicist and allen is burns secretary she s hilarious the problem as others have pointed out is fontaine who has to dance with astaire at the end of the film stevens could easily have used a double because he shows the dance in a long shot and it takes place among the trees i would have thought it was a double except the dancing was so lousy definitely worth seeing despite its flaws
thought at first this film would be your typical western film however it turned out to be very interesting and kept me spellbound right to the very end which turned out very unusual charlton heston sam burgade midway had past experiences with james coburn zach provo deadfall and zach never forgave sam and would stop at nothing to make sure he caught up with him and paid him back unfortunately barbara hershey susan burgade the portrait of a lady managed to get caught up in this situation and found herself among sex starved men who never seemed to leave her alone sam burgade had to make some very hard decisions and and i was quite surprised at the conclusion this is a very entertaining film and the acting was outstanding
i have become quite fond of laurence olivier in the past few weeks and was thrilled when i discovered this gem i have always found it wonderful when i run across a film where i do not have to have my finger on the remote control in case nudity rears its ugly head the divorce of lady x is charming till the final scene and must have been a true delight for viewers back in i only wish people today could accept and love true humor instead of the horrid trash talk people now call funny the divorce of lady x is well worth anyone s time
still the definitive program about the second world war the world at war isn t just long but also very informative the series contains episodes each episode lasts for about min and includes the events leading up to and following in the wake of the war most episodes are about the war in europe and there are several episodes about the war in the pacific other episodes include information about the wars in africa burma the atlantic and the home fronts of germany great britain united states and soviet union there is one episode that s dedicated to the holocaust the series starts off with the episode a new germany and tells about the rise of the nazis in germany and german territorial gains prior to the outbreak of war the series ends with the episode remember the war s influence in a post war world remember is a fitting episode to end this great program every episode begins with a short introduction and then with opening credits the credits are accompanied by a powerful music theme there are many fitting music pieces throughout the series each episode is like a mini film the footage is fantastic and so is the way it was put together in addition some of the footage is in color the information included also makes the episodes memorable and entertaining the series was produced by jeremy isaacs for thames television uk commissioned in it took four years to produce such was the depth of its research the series was narrated by laurence olivier one of the most famous and revered actors of the th century the series interviewed leading members of the allied and axis campaigns including eyewitness accounts by civilians enlisted men officers and politicians amongst them albert speer karl donitz jimmy stewart bill mauldin curtis lemay lord mountbatten alger hiss toshikazu kase arthur harris charles sweeney paul tibbets traudl junge and historian stephen ambrose jeremy isaacs says in the making of the world at war that he sought to interview not necessarily the surviving big names but their aides and assistants the most difficult subject to locate and persuade to be interviewed according to isaacs was heinrich himmler s adjutant karl wolff the latter admitted to witnessing a large scale execution in himmler s presence the world at war is often considered to be the definitive television history of the second world war some consider it the finest example of the documentary form in a list of the greatest british television programmes drawn up by the british film institute in voted for by industry professionals the world at war ranked th the program has everything that the viewer needs to know about the war after watching a few episodes i liked the series so much that i tried to watch the remaining episodes one after the other i ve seen some of them several times there are two other great documentary series that i know of that may be of interest to the viewer one is called the great war that s about world war i the other is called cold war that s about the cold war obviously
and a rather unexpected plot line too for the era there is plague in the city of new orleans and only richard widmark can stop it elia kazan s trademark subjects waterfronts working men crowds fugitives blue collar folk violence on a backstreet are all showcased here jack palance is quite effective as the ice cold mobster out for a big score zero mostel as dom delouise somewhat miscast but certainly watchable as his go fer i enjoyed barbara bel geddes as the stalwart cool wife i thought she and widmark were a believable couple he himself always reminds me somewhat of sinatra in the face and in the intense quiet manner and that is meant as a compliment if anything i d never even heard of this movie and yes you have to admire widmark s performance i also enjoyed paul douglas he seemed to play this role many times they make an unlikely but effective team the plague itself is a mcguffin and you gotta know it s not exactly done the way it would have been in real life rather small scale at the least no but i found it carried the plot along nicely check this out it s good outta
in some ways the wrath of kriemhild surpasses siegfried s death but it also loses some of that film s greatness the plot of this one is more cohesive than the first which is quite amazing the second half of the actual poem is a lot sloppier and a lot harder to tread through until that is you get to the climactic battle scenes only the iliad s are better lang and harbou embellished the huns the poet compiler of the nibelungenlied didn t know a hun from his right ball and as a result they are more or less the same as the burgundians in custom for example although the poet clearly describes etzel as a heathen which is kriemhild s main concern as rudiger tries to persuade her to marry him when she gets to hunland the first thing she does is go to mass the huns here are clearly heathens they re almost like caveman the depiction of them is hilarious especially verbal the jester who has two marvelous scenes etzel s character has been given more weight he is much more formidable all he does is bemoan his fate in the original poem lang and harbou are masterful at building suspense especially at the banquet scene which is intercut with verbal s second performance to an amazing effect however as is the nature of this half of the poem the film s amazing technical accomplishments are missing in this one for the most part except for a dazzling sequence where etzel s hall burns down with the nibelungs inside the one thing i do have to object to is the way harbou changes the ending spoilers in the poem after hildebrand captures hagen and gunther they are imprisoned kriemhild visits hagen in his cell and demands that he reveal where he has hidden the horde he refuses and she herself decapitates her brother when hagen still refuses she decapitates him hildebrand or possibly dietrich is so disgusted that a woman would presume to murder a great warrior that he in turn decapitates her calling her a devil woman etzel who is much weaker in the poem than he is here says something silly like ah me i can understand why they would want to keep a unity of time and place as hildebrand brings them from the castle to retain the prison settings of the two deaths would make the film very anticlimactic i also understand why they didn t have hildebrand kill kriemhild his character is much reduced here his name is only mentioned once but to have kriemhild kill herself adopting brynhild s death from the icelandic sources is just catering to the audience instead of challenging them the point of the poem is that kriemhild s wrath goes far beyond it should into the realm of pure evil here we simply have her die for her lost love it s not as interesting
i was up late flipping cable channels one night and ran into this movie from about minutes into the start every time i even thought going to bed something kept on telling me to keep on watching it even though it was way way way past my bedtime this movie could have been another easy slam dunk anti gun film but instead they chose to examine the aftereffects of the shootings and even better the movie kept on with the real life just when you think they are going to take the easy and obviously contrived way out a twist comes along and changes the whole outlook of the movie this film not only doesn t follow the formula it shows how other events often lead up to and or affect what happens afterwards i only wish the filmmakers had explored the issues around anti depressant drugs more the kids from columnbine who did the shootings were on them for years and it was frightening to watch the way deanna popped them every time the nightmares started up until recently they were dispensing the stuff like candy and only now do they even begin to understand what long term effects the drugs have it was very refreshing to see that the mental illness aspect of the story was given quite a bit of film having a relative who suffers from a mental illness i can say that the movie was dead nuts on in every aspect of mental illnesses bravo to the director and writer who obviously did their homework on those issues and for those who think certain things couldn t happen in a hospital i don t want to tell any particulars you re dead wrong on that too i ve been there the script was so real it was amazing go buy this film and show it to your teenage kids before it s too late someday they ll thank you for it
this one tends to get slighted by a lot of critics and kurosawa fans but i thought it was wonderful it s an episodic multi character study of tokyo s poorest who live in a city literally made from garbage though it looks like an a bomb just hit the film has a sort of serene beauty thanks to the glorious use of technicolor the title comes from the sound made by the insane young man who drives an imaginary trolley through the slum all the characters were wonderful and all the stories engrossing but perhaps the most tragic concerns the man and his young son who live in an abandoned car when not searching for food they spend their spare time using their imagination to build their dream house an emotionally moving and beautiful film
when philo vance edmund lowe is standing precariously on the edge of a balcony high above the city apparently hypnotized and just about to step to his death it immediately reminded me of a nearly identical scene in another film made nine years later the woman in green in which sherlock holmes basil rathbone is similarly about to hurl himself into space while being hypnotized happily both philo vance and sherlock holmes survive these attempts at murder by unscrupulous criminals exciting cinematic suspense in both these scenes when will they learn you can t cloud the minds of great fictional detectives
what can one say about a film that has one of the blackest most nihilistic and occasionally most weirdly i wont say sympathetic i will say charismatic villains in the history of the cinema and the best sword fight since flynn and fairbanks were in their heyday this is an epic about a stubborn sometimes foolish incredibly courageous and honest mans fight for his honor and freedom against tyranny i loved it john hurt and tim roth were great villains jessica lange was very moving tender and sensual
i rented the film i don t think it got a theatrical release here out expecting the worse the previews made the film look awful i was in fact very surprised it was well worth watching it was loosely scripted almost like an ensemble piece of film it had some very funny moments in it and although flawed is an effective satire on the show and the people on the show without being too scathing it is flawed mainly by the awful soundtrack of bludgeoning comedy effects but on the whole it comes across as honest and generally true to form of the show in an altmanesque or larry sanders way at the moment it is the fashion to be critical of jerry springer he is also an easy target springer could have made citizen kane and it would be proclaimed the worst film ever made i recommend this film for anybody interested in the show a flawed but innovative and interesting piece of film
okay as you can see this is one of my favorite if not favorite films this is a character drama which is absolutely hilarious the main character is a business man who is stuck in a same thing different day mentality he sees a woman looking melancholy out a window of a dance studio from his train everyday and wonders about her and decides to find out more about her he decides to join the dance class only to find out she is not the instructor from there he bonds with four other dancers and learns to enjoy dancing as well as finding out about the mysterious woman there is no gratuitous or any sex involved just how a small group of people learn how friendships are formed and developed this film was remade with richard gere and jennifer lopez and the new one while appealing is nowhere as enjoyable as the original the movie never made it big in america because it was not eligible for the oscars since it was broadcast on television in japan movies cannot be released on tv or they are disqualified for oscar nominations it did win numerous awards in japan for best film cast director etc for their oscar awards
i cannot begin to describe how amazing this movie is suffice it to say anytime i m depressed about how unfair or futile things seem this is the movie i go rent to put me in the right frame of mind the background music makes you realize the easiness of existence and how simplicity provides for the greatest happiness the indian girl that sings is but one example of a character in this film who does not try hard and is happy as a result persifina the laundry co worker of ruby s ashley judd is another her eyes and smile could make the hardest person s day i watch this movie and i dream of better days to come or of a good conversation with friends and i realize that being alone ruby is alone quite often isn t the same as being lonely recommended for anyone who enjoys a thoughtful lull of a movie
i read all of nancy drew as a preteen and collect the books as a grown up i loved the effect used at the end and a little bit at the beginning of the movie where line drawings in the style of the books morphed into scenes from the movie it was a neat way of pointing out connections between situations in the movie and the books for example the scenes with the oriental antiques dealer were very reminiscent of many scenarios i remember from the books i thought ned was perfectly cast and emma roberts was a wonderful st century interpretation of nancy drew just like the picture of betty crocker she keeps up with the times
by five years after this one was released james stewart and anthony mann had completed another six films together four of them westerns their rapport was obvious from the outset and what was intended as little more than a universal progrmmer became both a cult and a classic buffs of the period will revel in the fact that the first ten names on the credits were all more than well known and that s not counting ray teal or anthony curtis later to become tony perhaps ten years later the psychological western was well entrenched but in it was rare to throw ahab into the mix with cain and abel to say nothing of addressing several other issues along the way and still furnish a conventional western on the surface and full credit to all concerned one to add to the dvd collection
another pokemon movie has hit the theaters and again i m hearing the same old pokemon is dead blah blah blah the franchise s detractors couldn t be more wrong kids are still playing the trading card game they re still watching the tv series they re waiting for the game boy advance games and they want to see pokemon the th movie that said pokemon the th movie introduces us to two more legendary pokemon suicune the north wind of lore and celebi guardian of the forest and star of the show celebi transports itself and a boy named sam years into the future to the present day where pokemon trainer ash his faithful pikachu and his friends brock and misty are traveling through johto sam and ash become fast friends once they discover the other s mutual love for pokemon sam s vintage pokeball with screw on top is a great moment together they decide to protect celebi from the villain of the story the team rocket agent aptly named vicious who is hell bent on capturing celebi for his own ends will ash and sam be able to protect celebi from vicious dark balls where does suicune fit into the picture will jessie james and meowth have bigger parts in this movie than before and just who is sam really like with the first movies if you go into the movie deciding that you re automatically going to hate it no matter what simply because it s pokemon or just because your child niece nephew younger sibling et cetera dragged you into it then you re going to hate it because you ve decided that you want to hate it that may be but to blindly trash pokemon the th movie simply because it is a pokemon movie and especially without having seen it is just plain stupid even non fans can enjoy this movie without having to know every last detail of the world of pokemon i m not saying that you will become a pokemon fan because of this movie but you can indeed enjoy it if you ll let yourself unlike the first pokemon movies pokemon the th movie is being distributed by miramax who i ve heard is also working on securing the rights to the th pokemon movie which was released this past summer in japan miramax claims to have some boffo aggressive marketing strategy for pokemon the th movie but all i ve seen so far is a feeble limited release which doesn t include the usual pikachu short in the beginning which i was really looking forward to this time i hope that miramax will see fit to put the pikachu short called pikachu s exciting hide and seek onto at least the dvd vhs release if not with a future wider release of pokemon the th movie i hope that the current release is just the tip of the iceberg for this very entertaining film
panic in the streets owes more to british noir that its american counterparts like reed s the third man and dassin s night and the city director elia kazan chose to film largely on location capturing the fresh and vibrant decadence of the new orleans slums in a decision borrowed from the masters of italian neorealism he also hired many non professional actors for minor roles lending an air of authenticity to the cityscape however any further comparisons with neorealism would be misguided for panic in the streets is pure melodrama of the best kind a murdered illegal immigrant fished out of the bay is found to be infected with pneumonic plague a deadly air borne mutation of bubonic plague which is transmitted from human to human and untreated has a mortality rate that approaches clinton reed richard widmark an officer with the u s public health service convinces the doubtful police chief paul douglas to undertake a city wide manhunt for the men responsible for the homicide lest they also be infected with the illness in my younger years i found wolfgang petersen s outbreak to be among the most horrifying movies i d ever seen that thriller which owes plenty to panic in the streets working title outbreak terrified me so efficiently because it depicted the ebola virus as both an invisible and invincible killer how does one defend themselves against such a thing kazan s film is the first that i know of to approach the subject of biological epidemics though it has difficulty ascribing visual recognition to an enemy that is basically undetectable to the human eye it instead uses jack palance as a human personification of the plague despite his venturing out among the filthy dregs of human society you never get the sense that clinton reed is placing his own life at risk some viewers have noted that reed never inoculated himself against the plague though i think it s safe to assume that he did so at the same time as the morgue staff nevertheless there s still a strong sense of urgency in the hunt for the infected man s killers underground street rats who pollute the sewers with their misdeeds in medieval times when the black death now widely believed to have been bubonic plague swept across the civilised world killing a third of europe s population many identified the destruction as being the work of the devil jack palance s character blackie serves effectively as satan in human form the angular jawed thug can occasionally be charming and charismatic but is always liable to explode into fits of violence his two hoodlums played by guy thomajan and zero mostel through terror more than anything else are constantly grovelling at his feet when one lackey falls ill with fever blackie deduces that the man s immigrant cousin must have brought something in with him the irony of his conclusion not passing unnoticed and so attempts to ascertain what this presumably valuable object must be he cradles the dying poldi in his arms a grotesque display of faux affection that is both pathetic and unsettling blackie satan is finally stopped not by the authorities but by the burden of his own infection evil as he attempts to board a cargo ship the primary vessel by which the plague spread across europe
i am from sweden and i have just seen this movie and the thing is that i thought it was okay i have seen many bad comments about it but you must remember that a lot of people that watch this two parts miniseries are located all over the world and not just in usa also remember that not everyone has ever heard of the film made in the s and maybe not in the events murders and even more that it can be hard to find the original movie and if so there always be people around that doesn t like black white films this one feels fresh and in color and will find its public its years old now but i just saw it for the first time i will try to find the first one if i can to compare them but i haven t seen it anywhere in sweden ofcorse there is internet but not for anyone in the world the thing here is that this is mostly part of an american crime history and was big in the s in just usa but in rest of the world it just past by i guess well it was told about for some time but years later it will fade away in for example europa cause time goes by we had our own problems and crimes so if someone will do a remake of the film and put it back in some light again its not a bad idea at all a new generation can take part of this horrible story and even the film about capote that was released just a few years ago witch was a pretty good film too i think it will boost interest to the events that took place some years ago and maybe stop it to fall in sleep it started me up and now i am looking for the robert blake version so it wasn t that bad huh this are my opinions some people will of course disagree but hey its okay sometimes there will be okay with remakes on old films its not every time the old ones are that good the film making techniques has developed a lot and scenes can be made more realistic if they want today its always a question of money of course there has been so many movies that were made in the good old days but there were also money missing bad directors etc and they remakes them today years later and suddenly they are okay to watch my friend got this box of old classic horror movies and s f and i cant say i was impressed of the so called good old days most of them you cold put in the trashcan directly they were so bad that we just sat there like zombies could not move like brain dead i cant recommend them to anyone some of them i have seen remakes of and i remember liking them but not the originals they were just painful awful this is like the old story of who was the best bond moore or connery i think if you see roger moore first you maybe find him the one to trust or like thanks for me and i am sorry for my english thats not so good lars from sweden
what irving thalberg did in making this film today would never be attempted again making a chinese story with occidental players even if they are of the caliber of paul muni luise rainer charley grapewin and walter connolly among others perhaps it s partly because the story was written by a westerner pearl buck who got a pulitzer prize for her novel in ms buck daughter of chinese missionaries probably brought china closer to the consciousness of america than any other person not the political struggles of china but the lives and toil of the every day people we find in the good earth unfortunately later on pearl buck became an apologist for the kuomintang china of chiang kai shek in all its virtues and excesses the rest of her literary output never matched the good earth in the sundowners there is a great description of comparing china to australia by peter ustinov when asked the difference ustinov said china was very big and very full and australia was very big and very empty that s what you see in the good earth china very big and very full of people more than she can deal with at times the good earth tells the story of wang lung paul muni as a young man who purchases a wife from a large house where she was a slave the woman o lan luise rainer bears him two sons and sees him through all the good times and bad they have drought famine revolution and a climatic locust plague luise rainer won the second of two consecutive oscars for portraying o lan she may have set some kind of record in that it has to be the leading player oscar performance with the least amount of dialog everything she does practically is done with facial expressions her performance could have been on a silent film with very minimal subtitles i think only john mills in ryan s daughter had fewer words and he was playing a mentally retarded man muni is not always appreciative of how supportive she is in that male dominated culture rainer helps in the field bears and raises the kids does the housework when muni becomes a man of property he takes a chinese second trophy wife who causes him a lot of grief still rainer stoically bears it all still muni is not a bad man and it s a tribute to the film and his acting and buck s writing that you don t hate him and the culture gap is bridged we ve got a group of oriental players now who do more than just kung fu movies i m surprised the good earth of all films has not been remade at this point i ll bet the chinese government would even let some american company do it on an actual location till then we ve got this great classic to appreciate and enjoy
just caught it at the toronto international film festival this is a good story told in a compelling way the handheld camera approach to action scenes added to the intensity of those scenes in a documentary style not a blair witch style joel schumacher shows he doesn t need a big budget to produce a gripping film the actors were strong particularly the actor playing the focus of the events in the film boz
what we have here is a damn good little nineties thriller that while perhaps lacking in substance still provides great entertainment throughout it s running time and overall does everything you could possibly want a film of this nature to do i saw this film principally because it was directed by john dahl a highly underrated director behind great thrillers such as the last seduction rounders and roadkill i figured that if this film was up to standard of what i ve already seen from the director it would be well worth watching and red rock west is certainly a film that dahl can be proud of the plot focuses on the overly moral michael a man travelling across america looking for work he ends up finding it one day when he stumbles upon a bar in red rock county only catch is that the job is to murder a man s wife he s been mistaken for a killer named lyle but instead of doing the job he plays both sides against each other and eventually plans to make a getaway however his attempts to escape are unsuccessful and he finds himself in a bad situation when the real lyle turns up john dahl appears to enjoy setting thrillers on the road he did it three years earlier with kill me again and again almost a decade on from this film with roadkill it s not hard to see why dahl chooses this sort of location as it provides a fabulous atmosphere for a thriller the likes of this one dahl also provides his film with a film noir like atmosphere as the plot mainly focuses on the central character and the word he is plunged into is full of dark and mysterious characters the acting is largely very good with nicholas cage doing an excellent job in the lead role and getting a class support from lara flynn boyle j t walsh and of course dennis hopper who once again commands the screen with his over the top performance it has to be said that the second half of the film isn t as gripping as the first but red rock west certainly is never boring and the way that dahl orchestrates the grand finale is excellent in that all the central characters get to be a part of it overall red rock west is a film that you re unlikely to regret watching it s thrilling throughout and you can t ask for much more than that
well i wasn t sure what the film was going to be like as i had only seen a little clip but i was thinking its going to be good and i was right i watched it twice on the day i got it and well it is my favourite film i think alison lohan played the part of beth really well she is such a grate actress and the writer must have gone into a lot of research to find out about bulimia although the ending when beth is in the hospital an has horus observation after meals because iv been told like house is ok and also that hospitals doesn t help bulimics as iv been told which is probably why i m still at home even tho my sister and mum would like to have me hospitalised as i to have bulimia but this is a grate film i recommend it to any one with or with out an eating disorder or for people who know some one with eating disorders as it can let them in to the lives of a bulimic person and see the world how they do a bit over all a grate film and i recommend it to any one and any type of person
unfortunately this film has long been unavailable as other posters have noted but this is one of the essential dramas of the great depression a lyrical and touching drama of love set in a shanty town it features performances by spencer tracy and loretta young that are just about the finest of their careers and it s a surpassing example of how the director frank borzage was able to create an almost fairy tale aura around elements of poverty crime and horrendous social inequity which just proves that how truly romantic and spiritual his talents were this film shows how love survives amidst squalor and desperate need and it is totally life affirming this is a real masterpiece of the period and is a movie that deserves to be more widely known
robert altman shouldn t make a movie like this but the fact that he did and that it turns out to be a reasonably good and tightly wound thriller in that paperback tradition of grisham thrillers shows a versatility that is commendable in the gingerbread man he actually has to work with something that unfortunately he isn t always very successful at or at least it s not the first thing on his checklist as director plot there s one of those big juicy almost pot boiler plots where a sleazy lawyer gets caught up with a desperate low class woman and then a nefarious figure whom the woman is related with enters their lives in the most staggering ways twists and plot ensues yada yada and it s surprising that altman would really want to take on one of these i saw that coming from back there endings or just a such a semi conventional thriller but it s a surprise that pays off because oddly enough altman is able to catch some of that very fine behavior or rather is able to unintentionally coax it out of a very well cast ensemble of a small town georgian environment the film drips with atmosphere if not total superlative craftsmanship sometimes it s good and sometimes just decent for altman as savannah is possibly going to be hit by a big hurricane and the swamp and marshes and rain keep things soaked and muggy and humid so the atmosphere is really potent but so are performances from sometimes hysterical kenneth branaugh embeth davitz as the woman who lawyer branaugh gets caught up with and robert downey jr when is he not good as the private detective in branaugh s employ did i neglect robert duvall who in just five minutes of screen time makes such an indelible impression to hang the bad vibes of the picture on as said some of the plot is a little weak or just kind of standard lawyer is divorced bitter custody battle looms innocent and goofy kids but at the same time i think altman saw something captivating in the material something darker than some of the other grisham works that has this standing out somehow if it s not entirely masterful it still works on its limited terms as a what will happen next mystery southern noir
i m years old and i love this cartoon burt reynolds and dom deluise make a great pair this movie is really funny and i love the songs my favorite songs are you can t keep a good dog down and that song about sharing i think it s called what s mine is yours this was the last movie with judith barsi who played the voice of anne marie my favorite character is charlie but i find itchy s voice is so fun to hear although some scenes i actually found scary i still have a hard time watching the scene with charlie s dream and carface scares the crap out of me other characters like king gator i found really funny the ending was adorable and was actually sad made me cry a little i give this movie
excellent movie albeit slightly predictable i have to comment on nicole kidmans acting in this movie some of her other works haven t shown the amazing talent this woman has but birthday girl doesn t suffer from this in the slightest even without words kidmans acting shines through
in loving memory of david tomlinson when i watched this movie for the first time i was years old and i got fascinated by this story of witches in the nd world war the scene which impressed me the most was the fight between the nazi soldiers and the medieval army it was exceptional to see this army without a body walk to fight the astonished singing their march this movie is fantastic from the trip to portobello road which became to me the most fantastic place of london to the journey to naboomboo angela lansbury and david tomlinson are really a fantastic couple she is always great it seems the good aunt of a family and david with his always astonished face is her great co protagonist we ll miss him a lot
it s awesome in story mode your going from punk to pro you have to complete goals that involve skating driving and walking you create your own skater and give it a name and you can make it look stupid or realistic you are with your friend eric throughout the game until he betrays you and gets you kicked off of the skateboard team you can pick a team to be on and you then start your own team there are many levels like new jersey manhattan and even school ii not part of story mode though from tony hawk s pro skater you can unlock secret skaters like iron man gene simmons and another skater you can create your own goals like skate letters combo letters tricktris gap and much more you can create the goal pedestrian and write what they speak if you get bored of doing that you can do the premade goals in premade parks the only thing i didn t like about this game was that sometimes it was hard to drive the cars
hollywood hotel has relationships to many films like ella cinders and merton of the movies about someone winning a contest including a contract to make films in hollywood only to find the road to stardom either paved with pitfalls or non existent in fact as i was watching it tonight on turner classic movies i was considering whether or not the authors of the later musical classic singing in the rain may have taken some of their ideas from hollywood hotel most notably a temperamental leading lady star in a movie studio and a conclusion concerning one person singing a film score while another person got the credit by mouthing along on screen hollywood hotel is a fascinating example of movie making in the s among the supporting players is louella parsons playing herself and despite some negative comments i ve seen she has a very ingratiating personality on screen and a natural command of her lines she is not the only real person in the script make up specialist perc westmore briefly appears as himself to try to make one character resemble another this film also was one of the first in the career of young mr ronald reagan playing a radio interviewer at a movie premiere reagan actually does quite nicely in his brief scenes particularly when he realizes that nobody dick powell is about to take over the microphone when it should be used with more important people dick powell has won a hollywood contract in a contest and is leaving his job as a saxophonist in benny goodman s band the beginning of this film by the way is quite impressive as the band drives in a parade of trucks to give a proper goodbye to powell they end up singing hooray for hollywood the interesting thing about this wonderful number is that a lyric has been left out on purpose throughout the johnny mercer lyrics are references to such hollywood as max factor the make up king rin tin tin and even a hint of tarzan but the original song lyric referred to looking like tyrone power obviously jack warner and his brothers were not going to advertise the leading man of th century fox and the name donald duck was substituted in any event the number showed the singers and instrumentalists of goodman s orchestra at their best so did a later five minute section of the film where the band is rehearsing powell leaves the band and his girl friend frances langford and goes to hollywood only to find he is a contract player most likely for musicals involving saxophonists he is met by allen joslyn the publicist of the studio the owner is grant mitchell joslyn is not a bad fellow but he is busy and he tends to slough off people unless it is necessary to speak to them he parks powell at a room at the hollywood hotel which is also where the studio s temperamental star lola lane lives with her father hugh herbert her sister mabel todd and her sensible if cynical assistant glenda farrell lane is like jean hagen in singing in the rain except her speaking voice is good her version of dan lockwood is one alexander dupre alan mowbray scene stealing with ease several times the only difference is that mowbray is not a nice guy like gene kelly was and lane when not wrapped up in her ego is fully aware of it having a fit on being by passed for an out of the ordinary role she wanted she refuses to attend the premiere of her latest film joslyn finds a double for her lola s real life sister rosemary lane and rosemary is made up to play the star at the premiere and the follow up party but she attends with powell joslyn wanting someone who doesn t know the real lola this leads to powell knocking down mowbray when the latter makes a pest of himself but otherwise the evening is a success and when the two are together they start finding each other attractive the complications deal with lola coming back and slapping powell in the face after mowbray complains he was attacked by powell and his gang of hoodlums powell s contract is bought out working with photographer turned agent ted healey actually not too bad in this film he even tries to do a jolson imitation at one point the two try to find work ending up as employees at a hamburger stand run by bad tempered edgar kennedy the number of broken dishes and singing customers in the restaurant give edgar plenty of time to do his slow burns with gusto eventually powell gets a break by being hired to be dupre s singing voice in a rip off of gone with the wind this leads to the final section of the film when rosemary lane herbert and healey help give powell his chance to show it s his voice not mowbrays it s quite a cute and appealing film even now the worst aspects are due to it s time several jokes concerning african americans are no longer tolerable while trying to photograph powell as he arrives in hollywood healey accidentally photographs a porter and mentions to joslyn to watch out powell photographs too darkly get the point also a bit with curt bois as a fashion designer for lola lane who is shall we say too high strung is not very tolerable either herbert s hoo hoo ing is a bit much too much of the time but it was really popular in and an incident where healey nearly gets into a brawl at the premiere this was one of his last films reminds people of the tragic still mysterious end of the comedian in december but most of the film is quite good and won t disappoint the viewer in
yes the cameras were in the right place at the right time it s so interesting to see how a world leader like chavez who supports the poor people in his country can be held in such low esteem in the us his worst sin in my opinion is caring about those who are at the bottom of the barrel what can be so bad about that i have always been fascinated by the us government media reaction to fidel castro at first castro was a good guy around when he supplanted batista soon however castro started turning the corporations in cuba toward the needs of the poor instead of the fat cats we re a decent country but why does our media and government have such a problem with sharing with the poor if these guys are dictators then we could use more dictatorships especially where the poorest of the poor live in the world
the premise of this anime series is about bread of all things to base a plot on i truly laughed the main character has a special bread making power that he was born with and he goes off to bread baking school i wish it were available on dvd and it doesn t matter if it s subtitled or dubbed it s that good even the theme song alone is funny at one point in the theme song there s an african japanese man with an afro on horseback wielding a french baguette as if it were a samurai sword these images will not make sense unless you see the anime you ll laugh until your sides hurt it is definitely the most unique anime i have seen thus far

i just saw this movie tonight opening night it was great i m a big fan of sports movies and this was right up there as one of my favorites dennis quaid was great oh by the way mr quaid if you read this my sister lives in austin where you live and she was supposed to buy you a drink once well she kinda stood you up but she didn t mean to c not that anyone s going to believe that anyway it s a great movie everyone who likes a good sports movie should go out and see it c
this film is one of the more risqu black and white films of this time in the early s before the hoyts code was enforced it s the story of a young beautiful woman moving to new york and making her way to the top of the business by using her body as a tool to get there barbara stanwyck plays the young and beautiful lily powers who indeed does a fairly well job with her performance lily moves to new york and makes her way up the business place by sleeping with all the men stanwyck does an outstanding performance as being a strong woman who uses men as one time deals hardly any emotion towards them playing them as if they were pawns lily powers is a woman who doesn t have love on her mind just power and money i thought this movie to be a little bit different then other films i have seen because there is hardly any background music heard i believe it is only because this is when people were first introduced to live sound and dialogue between the people of the film the few times the music is heard is during the beginning as we are shown how she makes her way up the chain the filming and different scenes were something fantastic the director of this film did all the right angles and all the right tricks making this film full of realism this film was all together an alright movie the ending to this movie wasn t as good as it should have been but it didn t entirely ruin it baby face had its slow moving scenes throughout the movie and perhaps a few predictable parts such as who she will sleep with next but this is a lovable movie that can be watched more then once and suggested to some people and friends
there is a story but more essentially the world of this film begins in chaos and comes to order over the course of ten minutes it is a celebration of life and an optimistic assertion of objective truth and good representing along an axis unexplored in previous cinema this film should be taught in every high school chiasmus
what i like about you is definitely a show that i couldn t wait to see each day amanda bynes is such an excellent actress and i grew up watching her show the amanda show she s a very funny person and seems to be down to earth holly is such a like able person and has an out there personality i enjoyed how she always seemed to turn things around and upside down so she messed herself up at times but that s what made the show so great i especially loved the show when the character vince came along nick zano is very hot and funny as well as gary wesley jonathan the whole cast was great each character had their own personality and charm jennie garth allison munn and leslie grossman were all very interesting i especially loved lauren she s the best she helped make the show extra funny and you never know what she s gonna do or say next overall the show is really nice but the reason i didn t give it a was because there s no more new episodes and because the episodes could ve been longer and more deep
the only thing i knew about this film prior to seeing it was robby the robot my preconception was that it was another in a long line of cheesy sci fi flicks that the s was noted for how wrong i was big studio big budget and big production values make this a strong contender at least visually for the best sci fi film coming out of the era i qualify with the word visually because war of the worlds is a lot darker and scarier than forbidden planet and probably fits the mold better as a foray into alien territory what impressed me immediately was the color rendition of the cinematography followed by the intricacy and scope of detail involved in dr morbius walter pidgeon home and laboratory but that was only the prelude to the icing on the cake the labyrinthine underground that served as the krell stronghold it appeared that krell technology was even more advanced than say that of star wars which made me consider audiences for this movie back when it was released probably sat in the same kind of awe that theater goers experienced in with sw or in with aliens watching it on a large screen tv in my living room offered me the same effect and i m fairly resistant to hyperbole it s not too much of a stretch to imagine forbidden planet as a direct antecedent of the star trek tv series gene roddenberry himself stated that the movie had a great impact on his vision for the show followers of that short lived series will readily recognize plot elements used here that turned up in star trek i had to do a double take when the men of united planets cruiser c v headed for a transporter room while the conundrum presented to robby that created an impossibility to respond was an element used at least two or three times in the st series where the movie definitely took a cerebral turn had to do with the whole idea of monsters from the id that morbius himself was using his subconscious mind to defend altaire iv was certainly a unique concept for when every other sci fi flick of the time was dealing with martians or other grotesque space creatures the film worked it s subtle magic on this viewer by helping me understand that morbius was the protector of altaire iv some time before commander adams leslie nielsen explained it you know looking at the calendar the year isn t that far off this movie may be the one that actually gets it right relative to exploring and living on other planets i think though that they ll have to come up with a sleeker looking version of robby
this movie is the best horror movie bar none i love how stanley just dumps the women into the lake i have been a fan of judd nelson s work for many years and he blew me away its a blend of horror and drama and romance not so much comedy his evil yet charming look captured me right then and there that look in his eyes i will never forget there s something about him i cant describe
michael cacoyannis has had a relatively long career but has surprisingly few credits to his name including some real duds such as the unfunny cold war satire the day the fish came out iphigenia however is a highlight adapted by cacoyannis from the play by euripides it s a superior rendering of the classic tragedy and recently made its first television appearance in many years in the united states courtesy the flix channel the film is shot on an epic scale but is decidedly not a big film with the emphasis placed on the simple story in supplication to the gods king agamemnon kostas kazakos is compelled to sacrifice his daughter iphigenia tatiana papamoschou much to the consternation of queen clytemnastrae irene papas kazakos and papas are both outstanding but it is the stunning papamoschou who brings the most interesting elements to the screen blending the innocence of childhood with the dawning realization that she is the pawn in a political game strongly recommended for fans of international cinema
my mom and i have just recently become addicted to this show laughing our butts off i ve only seen about episodes and i am disappointed that i didn t pay attention to this hilarious series before they were canceled the story line is very funny the characters really have great personalities or not so great but they re still funny i tivo every episode of what i like about you amanda bynes and jennie garth as well as all of the cast never leave me bored while watching there is some unsuitable language for children and some sexual content but with a parental guide near you shouldn t have too much problems there is some sort of friends type of relationship that attracts me to this show i really enjoy it
i expected something different more passion drama again another failed attempt of originality i m sorry to say that the film falls into the old clich of cheesiness year old teens may appreciate it though the acting was not very convincing and the lines common lacking any wit still the soundtrack was good and well adapted i can t say that this movie is a total flop because people do watch it but it didn t meet the public s expectations and sunk into mediocrity so to conclude the production keeps you in front of the tv for almost an hour and a half which is an appreciable thing thus i guess its worth seeing if you don t get annoyed
incredibly artistic nobody could make them now i think it seem to be perfect the biggest and the greatest musical ever made listen to the beautiful songs the are quite poetry i m italian and admired by american musical why can t you do something like that now american were the best and for that i absolutely show my devotion to you with this movie there are words to describes the perfection of this movie all of a sudden my heart sings what makes the sunset i fall in love to easily jealousy and the scene with tom and jerry the greatest without reserve if you you doesn t know your eyes are not open my friends you must see it and appreciate wake up
a few years ago i added a comment to the imdb on the real mccoys tv series i said then and repeat now it was a charming funny and entertaining show well acted with wonderful characterizations i recently saw on dvd four old episodes plus the reunion of with richard crenna kathy nolan and tony martinez as another writer here mentioned it is curious that lydia reed hassie and michael winkelman little luke weren t refered to but perhaps they can be tracked down via sag or aftra the reunion show was well done and gave us many unknown insights into the show one piece of inside information we did not get was whether or not kathy nolan regretted quitting the show in an unpleasant contract dispute which left luke a widow in it s last year which wasn t very good nolan went on to do a bomb of a comedy called broadside about women nurses in the pacific in ww ii get it broadside no not funny unlike the sleazy salacious and violent trash on tv now that is so undermining our values the real mccoys entertained with decent values and fine human beings and i thank all involved including the creator irving pinkus for having brought it to my family we never missed it
all of the people reviewing this film and probably many professional film reviewers just don t get it this film was made with matting sequences and art techniques quite like the works of the great czech filmmaker karel zeman if you want to know what i m talking about i suggest you get any of zeman s films such as the fabulous world of jules verne baron munchausen journey to the beginning of time or on the comet if you are unable to locate a film then read the reviews in amg they will explain the processes used if one were to look at zeman s work and try to compare it to any of the other sci fi fantasy films of the time viewers probably wouldn t have gotten it then either it is unfair to compare either of these filmmakers styles to the standard technologies of the day because both zemen and hines do not compute they have a style that is unique to them and should be judged for their creativity only if you look at this film from a perspective where you know that he intentionally tried to create a pastiche collage of mattes mixed with live action you could easily come to the conclusion that he did a masterful job it isn t easy making a bunch of computer cutouts flow i thought that the creatures were also quite good also considering how they were made hines took a great gamble and i think his film will not be fairly judged for years to come someone promoting the film should have tipped the audience off as to what they would be seeing rather than let them blindly go into the theater expecting the usual cg work regarding the actors i think hines also took a page from zemen s book in that many of zemen s actors were somewhat expressionless at first but became much more engaging as the film and action went on it is totally refreshing to me to have this movie in my library i will watch it for years to come all three great hours of it
uneven bollywood drama karisma kapoor is excellent as an indian woman in canada who marries a friend sanjay kapoor has a child and then visits his family in india only to find they are terrorist warlords drama and tragedy ensue and the film becomes a kind of not without my baby styled thriller film is compelling its few song dance numbers are uninteresting and needless the gaity of bollywood song and dance is really out of character for the intensity of this film s drama at least once we ve left the comforting confines of their canadian love nest although one number involving a cameo by the stunning aishwarya rai is enjoyably provocative if ultimately misplaced as well likewise the inclusion of bollywood superstar shahrukh khan as a happy go lucky drifter who helps kapoor in her escape from the clutches of the warlord turns what had been a very serious drama into a silly farce and it only gets back on his feet when his character and his fantasies about rai that generate her cameo dance are dispensed with his throw away comic book dialog and the silliness of his fight scenes detract from the film s primary gripping drama the cast is nicely supported by nana patekar as the warlord and the elegant deepti naval who is outstanding as his long suffering wife who finally choses to stand up against him in one of the film s best scenes ritu shivpuri and rajshree solanki are also very good as sanjay s sisters in india and very pleasing eye candy but sanjay himself overacts terribly especially during obvious ad libs the directorial style of writer director krishna wamsi is sloppy rampant with rough transitions and abrupt cuts although his camera movement is good the musical underscore is also quite effective moody featuring wordless female voice over a small orchestral ensemble too bad little if any of that made it onto shakti s soundtrack cd but bollywood hasn t yet discovered the value of including score along with songs on their soundtrack albums at least not in most cases but shakti is karisma kapoor s film all the way though and the intensity of her performance once the film switches to india contrasts nicely with the gentle romance with which she engaged with sanjay in the initial canadian scenes despite the unevenness of much of the picture karisma s performance completely sells the film and solidifies its otherwise inconsistent measures in a strange way also i found the story to be another take on the ostentation of royalty i d noticed in curse of the golden flower and marie antoinette both of which i d seen just prior although shakti of course is an entirely different kind of film but the focus on a dysfunctional royal family here living in the austerity of terrorism controlled poverty in india rather than the elegance of versailles or the massive megalomania of feudal china s tang dynasty whose self serving seeking of power brings ruin upon many others and forces an uprising of one kind or another provides the film with a notable subtext
this movie was nominated for best picture but lost out to casablanca but paul lukas beat out humphrey bogart for best actor i don t see why lucile watson was nominated for best supporting actor i just don t think she did a very good job bette davis and paul lukas and their three kids are leaving mexico and coming into the united states in the first scene of the movie they are going by train to davis s relatives house davis and lukas were in the underground to stop the nazis so they are very tired and need rest but when they arrive home their is a nazi living there and their s not much either can do about it it turns out the nazi only cares about money and is willing to make a deal with lukas their is more to the plot but you can find that out for yourself
paul verhoeven has one of the strangest oeuvres of any major director he started off making art house films in his native netherlands before moving to hollywood where he began making subversive genre pieces which are often seen as mere entertainments by the mainstream crowd s the fourth man was the last film he made before moving to the u s and it seems to have been a transitional film for him from the beginning of the fourth man it s clear that the film will be seen from the perspective of the famous albeit impoverished author gerard in a seeming homage to carol reed s similarly titled film the third man the film begins with an author making a trip to speak to a crowd of literature enthusiasts the similarities end there however as gerard runs into no major complications before arriving at the auditorium and the speech itself goes fairly smoothly in spite of the relative ease with which he completes this function we know that the author is somewhat troubled as he has realistic fantasies about murdering his roommate before leaving his house and he also has a surreal fantasy involving a hotel he sees advertised and a detached eyeball growing out of a door s peephole that he sometimes has trouble keeping his fantasies separate from reality is made all the more clear when an anecdote he tells is exposed as untrue and he admits that he lie s the truth until he no longer knows whether something did or didn t happen the fourth man is full of surreal fantasies and dreams which are made all the more disturbing because it s very easy to see how they relate to events which we have seen occur and because they sometimes foreshadow events which haven t occurred yet between the effectiveness of the unreal sequences and verhoeven s careful editing style this ends up being the most atmospheric film this side of don t look now and like that film this one is full of ambiguity unlike that film the fourth man is also perversely funny as gerard s deeply held catholic beliefs seep into every aspect of his life including sexuality he naturally associates a female hair stylist he knows intimately with the biblical delilah though he fears she ll remove an even more important symbol of masculinity with her scissors in an erotic fantasy sequence that would make luis bu uel blush he substitutes a man he s attracted to for a life size statue of christ on the cross the fourth man is a horror film which manages to bring the viewer into the mind of the protagonist while still maintaining a certain ambiguity it certainly seems as if gerard is in danger but it may just be more of his lying the truth the film is also full of both subtle and not so subtle visual symbolism which helps make it a unique and satisfying cinematic experience
i saw this movie when i was a child it blew me away this was before the days of television so a movie of this magnitude could send a young kid into orbit it so impressed me that i went to see this movie for twelve consecutive days the special effects used at this time were far ahead of its time sabu was a real delight as was rex ingram as the genie i found myself singing i want to be a sailor for months after the film left town i would recommend this movie to any and everyone i forgot to mention conrad veidt who was as villainous a character as you d ever want to meet also june duprez was never lovelier than she was in this picture the color was outstanding give this movie an aaa
it was originally meant to be a film that gene kelly would star in but when the makers couldn t get him they got the greatest actor in the world and the result is pretty good basically nathan detroit frank sinatra is having trouble doing what he does best setting up a high stakes crap dice game because he needs to get the place so to get the money he needs he has a bet with old friend sky masterson marlon brando that he can t get sergeant sarah brown great expectations golden globe winning and bafta nominated jean simmons to go with him to havana meanwhile nathan is having trouble trying to get rid of the woman who wants him to ask her hand in marriage miss adelaide vivian blaine also starring robert keith as lieutenant brannigan stubby kaye as nicely nicely johnson and b s pulley as big jule an interesting romantic comedy musical with brando singing all his own songs and sinatra being smooth and cool it was nominated the oscars for best art direction set decoration best cinematography best costume design and best music for jay blackton and cyril j mockridge it was nominated the bafta for best film from any source and it won the golden globe for best motion picture musical comedy frank sinatra was number on the greatest pop culture icons marlon brando was number on the greatest movie stars he was number on the greatest sex symbols he was number on years stars men sinatra was number and brando was number on the world s greatest actor luck be a lady was number on years songs for the film was number on years of musicals and it was number on the greatest musicals very good
i found this film the first time when i was searching for some works in witch st phane rideau had participate still in an extraordinary ravishment caused by the astonishingly beautiful les roseaux sauvages in portuguese juncos silvestres by andr t chin i was searching for similar movies in the come of age line i found then presque rien a movie where the director s bastien lifshitz deliciously amazes us earning a nomination by the cannes festival in the story is about two guys the kind boy next door mathieu j r mie elka m and c dric st phane rideau who meet during the summer vacations in a land far from where he lives mathieu spends is days at the beach with his sister there he meets c dric a local with whom he starts this estival and revealing relationship much by means of the sensual and seducer personality that st phane rideau gives his characters in les roseaux sauvages years younger he still preserves the innocence of the sweet seducer witch matures here in experience exemplar in directing in the amorous sequence in the intimate and confessing description that is made about a boys first facing his still ambiguous sexuality and great love the first love in its terrible progression ecstasy despair the best of the film is the best of france the fervent passion the hot and excited rationalism the brownish beauty the simple and natural acceptance made by the families although not without surprise and first anger still there is the beach the luminosity the lightness e simplicity of summer the freshness of breeze the surge s melody and the expressive eyes of an introverted elka m hesitant hurt puzzled passionate the sex is not avoided nor exploited it is treated as it is with no exhibitionist intention in virtue of pure talent this is a work of drama of uncommon quality without cheap sentimentalism showing an inevitably real image of two homosexual in their prime youth as any ordinary person although with a social fear of rejection and shame it is well worthy being seen especially by those who adore french movies although the dvd front cover is very lame with the two actors in between tens of stars greased with brilliantine a movie witch in my opinion deserves an
i just picked up the dvd release of this movie while on holiday in norway where it has been released with english subtitles the film is beautifully photographed and powerfully acted the youngster portraying frits the lead character has an astonishingly open face which mirrors with painful accuracy the tragic events which unfold around him early on in the film we see that the father whom frits loves so much has mental health problems and this is brought up when the brutal headmaster denies assaulting the boy and suggests it was his own father the climactic scene where frits refuses to show any respect to the headmaster simply standing his ground and repeating liar as he is brutally assaulted in front of his classmates is a scene you are not likely to forget the films only weak point is the rather clich d flower power teacher who uses every friendly teacher trick in the book other than this i feel sure that this is a film you will really enjoy
there s an inexhaustible hunger for basic training movies so it s surprising that this one got so little notice when first released looks likely to have a well deserved second life on dvd vhs tigerland isn t uniformly great by any means there are some terribly cliched characters especially the portrayal of the nco s makes you long for the return of lee full metal jacket ermey but the lead performance of colin farrell is the stuff of instant stardom charisma to burn and a role any actor would kill to get
brilliant movie the drawings were just amazing too bad it ended before it begun i ve waited years for a sequel but nooooo
the world of the sci fi drama soylent green is what we could be seeing if we aren t careful it is a world in which new york city s population has topped the million mark in the year overpopulation air pollution year long heat waves and food shortages are the rule the only hope comes from a food product called soylent green but what is this particular food stuff really made of that question is at the heart of this admittedly somewhat dated but still intriguing film based on harry harrison s novel make room make room charlton heston stars as thorne an nypd detective who comes across the murder of a top corporate executive joseph cotten as it turns out cotten was on the board of directors of the soylent corporation the people responsible for all those food stuffs that the people have to consume in lieu of the real thing heston believes that this wasn t just a garden variety murder that cotten was bumped off for a reason he gets a lot of help from his slightly cantankerous but very astute book edward g robinson in his st and final cinematic appearance and a few timely reminders of what the world used to be like what robinson finds out about soylent green shocks him beyond all imagination but before he can tell heston all of what he knows he has himself euthanized and when heston does indeed find out the secret of soylent green well that part has become immortalized into cinematic history under the very professional guiding hand of director richard fleischer the boston strangler fantastic voyage soylent green is a fairly grim but thought provoking look at a dystopian future that humanity might be living if we don t curb our tendency to strip our planet of its natural resources indeed this was a project that heston himself had had in mind for filming as far back as after he had struck gold in the sci fi genre with planet of the apes a fact that probably gets lost whenever his ultra conservative political philosophy comes up in conversation after all soylent green is hardly a tract for unrestrained capitalism robinson as always is the consummate professional in his last role the sequence where he is euthanized as he looks at video of the world from a better era set to the music of tchaikovsky beethoven and grieg is quite simply heartbreaking the film also benefits from solid supporting help from chuck connors as a very convincing heavy brock peters as heston s superior and leigh taylor young as the woman who tries to help heston in his inquiries it must seem easy these days to dismiss soylent green for being dated but those who do it ought to think twice for this film s world may end up becoming ours in actuality if we don t watch what we do with what we have today
jackie chan s police story is a landmark film for both the honk kong action genre and the career of jackie chan directed written by chan police story has a basic plot as did all the films of that era and genre and like most of the the films of police storys kind the script is nothing to be raved about but the plot of the film is jackie chan who plays a nice guy cop struggling to convict the local gang lord the direction of the film is nothing special and by no means the best directing effort that jackie chan has given us that responsibility falls to the underrated masterpiece miracles however the job that jackie does directing is sufficient and respectable the standout out directing of the film comes with the fight scenes the performances in this film also vary with jackie giving a very solid typical chan nice guy up against it role but this is by no means his best acting role that can been seen in the sammo hung directed film heart of the dragon the other actors in the film also give as good a solid performance as jackie with bridgete lin playing her part of the unwilling witness reasonably well but neither does she display full acting potential the standout acting comes from maggie cheung as jackies suffering girlfriend and bill tung as the sympathetic and funny police chief none of the performances in this film is of a low enough standard to affect the quality of the film the action in the film is what really separates this film from others with stunning contemporary choreography to suit the urbanised modern setting the action is some some of the greatest fight scenes ever put on camera to begin with there is a shootout in the slum where koo ganglord is making a drug deal whilst being no john woo style sequence this serves as a nice starter for the film this is then followed by the famous car run down the side of the hill and through the heart of the slum wrecking everything in sight this is a breathtaking sequence that has since been shamelessly copied by bad boys in the middle of the film is yet another standout sequence as jackie tries to transport bridgete lin from her house to his this is really the first scene where we get to see the awesome fast paced hand to hand combat that has since become the norm for all modern set martial art films this sequence is fantastically choreographed timed and seamlessly edited together to maximise the brutality of the scene however as tradition dictates the standout fight sequence is at the end of the film this sequence displays some of chans best choreography stunts and camera editing work this sequence is now famous for two things the amount of people sent through high density glass which has to be said a phenomenal amount of people and the stunt at the end where jackie leaps from a th storey balcony grabs hold of a pole and slides down through a glass roof this has to be seen to be believed whilst the two for mentioned factors are both uniquely brilliant i think that the most impressive part of this fight sequence is chans ability to incorporate anything into the fight sequence and the sheer originality of the choreography that for me has never been bettered i also believe that the action in police story is some of the best filmed and edited action of chans career helping to set the action apart from others overall police story despite its unspectacular storyline and script and over running in the middle due to plot padding is one of the best action films of all time displaying chans best choreography best filmed action and arguably his most spectacular stunt making this essential viewing for everyone afterall we watch a chan movie for the action
i think it s one of the greatest movies which are ever made and i ve seen many the book is better but it s still a very good movie
one of the very best three stooges shorts ever a spooky house full of evil guys and the goon challenge the alert detective agency s best men shemp is in top form in the famous in the dark scene emil sitka provides excellent support in his mr goodrich role as the target of a murder plot before it s over shemp s trusty little shovel is employed to great effect this minute gem moves about as fast as any stooge s short and packs twice the wallop highly recommended
as soon as i heard about this film i knew i had to check it out well i heard about it then i found the trailer after that that s when i knew i had to see it and i am so glad i did you want to see classic television mixed with zombies no then get lost fido is a movie unlike anything i ve ever seen well actually it kind of is it s kind of like a lassie episode and a zombie film though when combined it feels completely new and original fido is about a little boy named timmy and his new pet fido well this new pet ain t no squawking parakeet or some potty trained puppy it s a re animated dead guy a zombie a large radiation cloud engulfed earth which led to all of the dead rising which ensued the zombie wars though through the genius of reinhold giger lead scientist of zomcon he discovered that if you destroy the brain the zombie will perish thus giving us the edge and the win in the zombie war though due to lingering radiation whoever dies becomes a zombie which can be a problem especially with the elderly though zomcom steps up again with more breakthroughs especially with the domestication collar the collar stops the zombie s need for human flesh and thus making it harmless as a household pet but not all is perfect in this zombie utopia collars break old people die and well i ll just let you watch this incredibly unique flick fido is a fantastic idea brought to fruition with an all star cast and great writing fido rises above most in the comedy horror genre there are plenty of funny and original situations that really had me entertained though after seeing the film i personally think the movie would have been better in black and white at less than minutes the movie doesn t go on for too long and moves from scene to scene at a good rate it ll probably end up being a cult classic of sorts since it s not really a laugh out loud comedy or even a horror movie it s a comedy family zombie film immersed in the vibe if you thought anything i said here was interesting by all means check this film out but if you re still on the fence swing your leg back over and stay there outta

yes as unbelievable as it may be in a musical won the academy award for best picture and it was the third musical to win that award in a five year period the first being my fair lady in and then the sound of music in the difference between my fair lady the sound of music and oliver however is that oliver is immeasurably better no comparison the first two movies are insipid wet noodles compared to the remarkably robust oliver the acting is great the songs are great the story is great and the dancing is great this movie is dynamic topical relevant to the human experience and unlike the overblown gangs of new york oliver offers a portrayal of poverty in th century london england that evokes sympathy without being condescending oliver reed was a great actor and he proves it in oliver the other actors and actresses especially ron moody and shani wallis are equally wonderful and offer powerful portrayals of characters who evoke sympathy and warmth without being caricatures
i have lost count of how many reviews i ve written on slaughter high i ve read a lot of bad ones and i will say right now this is a fantastic movie simon scuddamore made his fame in a short time for his well known suicide and even though this was his only film he is what made the movie so great at first i did not know anything about simon until i read a review about his suicide then i found out due to the current webpage at www imdb com he was born in in dayton ohio simon may have played the most pathetic character known to man but his real life self certainly had their strenghths and weaknesses he did a good acting job who can disagree i always wondered how he felt showing himself naked in a movie must have been pretty embarrassing to say the least i first saw this movie when i was in the sixth grade i agree with some pointers like the girl would not take a bath after somebody was murdered and that high schools do not have bath tubs i think caroline munro who was at the time was the only other star that had any dignified acting talent and unfortunately for simon s death he made no future films the reason s for his suicide are a mystery and hopefully will be discovered in the near future doing the math on his webpage it tells you he was years old when he made slaughter high he looked like a teenager i give this film two thumbs up the best horror film made probably because of their horrible acting the others didn t make fame in the movie business jacob young
ever since i can remember and i m only my mother and i have been and continue to watch older movies because well i find them much more rewarding in the long run but hey don t get me wrong i do love the movies we have today just not as much as i love movies of the s and s anyways now i have to say the moment i started watching the movie my eyes were glued to the tv of course my favorite character was the grandmother played by lucile watson but i loved the way betty davis and her family was portrayed the children did not act like children in the slightest but there is good reason for that having had to hid and run most of your life seeing the awful things children saw those days destroyed their innocence so people saying oooo i hated how the kids acted blah blah blah read between the lines and know they saw things children should not see paul lukas dear paul did an amazing job now i know many people are mad that he go the oscar and bogie didn t but hey they both did amazing jobs so i think it could have gone either way but lukas performance was so amazing that by the end of the movie i was reduced to tears i loved this movie so much and recommend it to anyone d
i don t believe this was an acting challenge for richard harris this was an uncomplicated plot yet interesting it is a good movie to watch when you don t want to do a lot of thinking just want to be told a simple story the canadian scenery was breathtaking the beautiful fall shots alone made the picture worth seeing
probably the finest fantasy film ever made sumptuous colour spectacular sets incredible spot on miklos rosza musical score that is perfect for each scene and mood acting is superb as well in what could have been stiff and pretentious in lesser hands but here the poetic dialog is deftly sensitively spoken the humour is subtle and delightful as well doubtless spielberg and lucas were enthralled by this one along with the four feathers one of the two finest motion pictures released by alexander korda and london films and one of the finest motion pictures ever made a true compelling classic
a disney movie that dares to do something different should at least be awarded for effort holes doesn t make the same mistakes as one would expect from a disney movie about troubled teenagers put in a camp for the first time events are not explained in details the flashback scenes really do serve a purpose and present several mature topics that may surprise the viewer i must admit that at first i was a bit put off by the seriousness of the movie but soon i realized that we had to endure those moments to see the beauty of the story besides the story this movie also does a good job of questioning some methods that are used in correctional facilities one example where caveman is forbidden to teach zero to read because they have to dig holes in order to build character like learning to read won t contribute to that holes is a movie that is smart and beautiful a must watch
centered in the downtown and out skirts of detroit this comedy i found to be a terrific new comedic duo noriyuki pat morita is a very funny man who happens to be a cop from japan on the trail of an industrial secrets thief who has stolen a proto type turbo super charger reluctantly he goes to the united states to follow the thief after being ordered by his commander pat s character collides with jay leno s character a fast talking but down to business player type detroit cop when they cross paths though the honorable ways of japan meet the all out old school detroit police investigative ways the two stumble and trip over each other at first but then develop a rythym that turns into an explosive two layered powerhouse team that solves the case cold after battling a city crime boss for the stolen equiptment and closing the case these two go from despising each other to being friends and working well together a little worse for wear and in need of an extended vacation on top of it all they manage to come to a victorious closing i rated this a lewis s direction makes this a near perfect comedy fun for all ages i recommend it highly
this is arguably john thaw s finest performance where he successfully shakes off any traits of his inspector morse character and brings a perfect adaptation of tom from the pages of the book to the tv screen this is a well made production which maintains its family viewing vibe despite some very mature themes like the outbreak of the second world war and the physical abuse suffered by the child however it is the relationship between tom and young willie that is the heart and soul of this story it is touching and beautiful to see this bond between the young boy evacuated from london and the grumpy old man he is left with develop a real grandfather grandson connection it is a pity that this story wasn t made with a bigger budget with a more established director as it belongs on the big screen not shown once or twice every ten years on a sunday afternoon given the right guidance john thaw would be celebrated the world over and bestowed with many awards for his brilliant performance in this movie a great actor and a great role that should have been honored more than it was at the time
i have to agree with mr caruso jr lanza s was the finest voice god had to offer if only he could have found the courage to go for broke leave hollywood and head for the opera he could have been the american caruso everyone says he could have been but in any case he is a fantastic introduction to the art form no bones about it and if thats the way its gonna be so be it see the film you ll see why mr lanza still come up in discussion even in my house someone says pavarotti i say mario lanza as for the film itself when will it be on dvd they must have it restored and vhs isn t good enough but this should also be the only lanza film put on dvd the others are down right bad and boring
there are very few performers today who can keep me captivated throughout an entire film just by their presence one of those few is judy davis who has built a successful career out of creating characters that are headstrong in attitude but very vulnerable at heart she takes roles that most other performers would treat melodramatically and adds a fiery deeply emotional intensity that pulls attention away from everything else on the screen her skills are well displayed in high tide a film that matches her up a second time with director gillian armstrong who gave davis her first major success with my brilliant career in that film davis played a young woman who was determined to make it in the world despite the suffocation she felt from her community and upbringing in high tide however davis character lillie is roughly the opposite she gave up on any hope for her future when she was young and after giving birth to a child runs from her responsibilities and takes up a life without direction or meaning when she finally meets up with her daughter years later the thought of taking care of her child is petrifying she knows this is her chance to atone for her failures but how can she be honest with her daughter and still gain her respect gillian armstrong s films usually relate stories about characters who desperately want to communicate with each other but face obstacles set up by their own personal habits and addictions oscar and lucinda for instance was about a man and a woman who desperately needed each other s love but were always blindsided by their craving for chance represented by their gambling addictions here we are immersed in the world of a family torn apart by the mother s inability to commit to a settled life and her struggles to redeem herself despite being fully convinced that it s too late to change for the better this is not simply a film with a great performance at its center but also a rare achievement a fully convincing story of redemption
i saw a lot films about charles dickens christmas carol but this one is the best of all there is an atmosphere which is exactly the same as in the book the actors george c scott and others are great unfortunately you can t often watch the film in germany and switzerland
i love this show period i haven t been watching very long probably only about six months or so actually but it is now my favorite show and probably will be for quite a while i love all of the characters except i don t really care for donna i m not completely sure why i just don t find her funny and i don t think laura prepon is a very good actress other than her i find the rest of the cast pretty good kurtwood smith and debra joe rupp who played erics parents were extremely funny topher grace is also a great actor unlike a lot of fans i did not completely hate the th season i still watch it and it does make me laugh but if you compare it to the shows earlier seasons its not good randy is horrible the finale was decent nothing amazing but good i do think it would have been better to cancel the show after ashton and topher decided to leave but oh well i have the fourth season on dvd and someday i hope to have all eight seasons on dvd some of its most hilarious episodes in my opinion were dine dash grandmas dead red stacey and streaking but i love every episode i ve seen so far which is most of them i think stars i would definitely recommend it
legendary movie producer walt disney brought three of the world s greatest fairy tales to the screen they remain among the most popular animated films of all time the first was his groundbreaking classic snow white and the seven dwarfs released in the last was the then under appreciated sleeping beauty which made it s debut in in between these two was perhaps his most satisfying adaptation of a classic fairy tale cinderella of the three films cinderella is the one most faithful to its origins ironically unlike snow white which for better or worse became for many the definitive version of the story cinderella did not follow the same path although it was a hit and like snow white was responsible for restoring the dwindling disney fortunes it never achieved the same audience recognition which it certainly deserved disney for once did himself proud electing not to tamper with a classic instead elaborating and adding substance to the tale rather than rewriting it for the screen the result was enchanting a combination of superb animation in beautifully soft technicolor and the perfect voice talents brought the story to life with a radiance that endures to this day ilene woods who was a radio performer recorded demonstration discs of the songs as a favor to the authors of the material al hoffman mack david and jerry livingston when disney heard them he knew he had found his cinderella and indeed he had woods heartfelt renditions of a dream is a wish your heart makes so this is love and oh sing sweet nightingale are perfect eleanor audley who would go on to voice maleficent in sleeping beauty masterfully captured the icy cruelty of the stepmother while rhoda williams and lucille bliss were convincingly nasty stepsisters luis van rooten admirably performed as both the king and the grand duke and james macdonald was endearing as both jaq and gus cinderella s devoted mice william phipps has little dialog as the prince future talk show host mike douglas provided his singing voice but film and disney veteran verna felton was born to play the fairy godmother and she made the best number the oscar nominated bibbidi bobbidi boo her own show stopper among the artists responsible for the look of the film was mary blair whose inspired use of color was greatly admired by disney her elegant french period backgrounds add tremendously to the quality of the movie but most important of all are the believable characters from cinderella right down to lucifer the stepmother s deliciously evil cat they bring both life and vibrancy to the often told story something very difficult to create in an animated film in conjunction with the film s year anniversary and not so coincidentally the coming holiday season cinderella has just been released on a special edition dvd it simply has never looked better the fully restored film must be seen to be appreciated suffice it to say it looks wonderful an enhanced stereo soundtrack has been added and serves the music well the dvd extras now a standard part of disney platinum editions are too numerous to list here but as usual some are directed towards children some are slanted to adults and the rest fall somewhere in between but real fans will want to get the deluxe gift set because along with an actual cell from the film and eight character sketches it includes a page hardback book which not only incorporates most of the material found in the book with the special edition home video release but much more as well as usual for disney cinderella will only be available for a limited time so if like me you are a cinderella lover get it now this edition is truly a dream come true
when i started watching the show i said oh no it s as corny as elfen lied and not even that bloody and indeed the setup is almost identical with the single young boy living in a big house all by himself then suddenly getting involved into a fantastic adventure while sexy young girls come live with him but this is where the resemblance stops the love story is almost as subtle and intense as the one in inuiyasha while the childish remarks and behaviors are very few the magical setup is a bit corny because it s about seven people with seven servants fighting for the holy grail all servants being someone famous half of all masters being from the same school rules of engagement etc however this soon dims and fades from the beauty of the drawing and of the script i actually watched all episodes in one day and without comparing it with animes that i liked more but were from other genres i have to say that i was very pleased
a couple of years back i had purchased and enjoyed the mgm double feature dvd of the two kolchak tv movies the night stalker and the night strangler when the universal set of the subsequent tv series came out i had intended to buy it immediately but rumors of playback issues with the dreaded dvd s kept me from adding it to my collection recently i placed an online order which consisted of a spate of discounted universal box sets and decided to pick up the kolchak discer as well having watched it now i can safely say that i didn t regret acquiring this beloved if short lived crime horror series one bit it may follow a standardized formula dogged and resourceful newspaperman carl kolchak marvelously played by darren mcgavin gets into everybody s hair with his attitude flustered editor simon oakland long suffering colleagues assorted authoritarian figures a plethora of monsters and villains faces up to the inevitable and usually supernatural threat alone but finally is pressured into keeping his story under wraps but a winning one further boosted by an impressive line up of guest stars and notable behind the scenes credits making the show a great deal of fun that said quality varies from one episode to another and the modest budgets afforded them results in special and make up effects which sometimes leave a lot to be desired for instance the werewolf in the eponymous entry and the goofy alligator creature in the very last installment not to mention the fact that these were restricted to minute programmes and intended for family consumption to boot rather precludes a simplified and wholesome rendering of its often intriguing psychological and metaphysical themes in the case of the werewolf again he s never seen biting anyone but somewhat foolishly is made to merely throw people around while the hero s cynical narration does a lot to pull one into the fanciful plots there s a healthy dose of comedy relief involved in each episode often but not exclusively revolving around mcgavin s relationship with either oakland or geeky reporter jack grinnage to say nothing of reasonable atmosphere the setting for the most part is chicago and suspense to make the ride even more pleasant there s a bouncy score by gil melle and jerry fielding for the record the monsters encountered but not always defeated by kolchak throughout the series are a revived jack the ripper a variety of cults voodoo native american aztec aliens vampire werewolf going round its over familiar concept by having this particular episode entirely set on a cruise liner doppelganger satanist swamp creature mass of electricity robot apeman witch headless motorcyclist succubus a knight s armor taking a murderous life of its own the episode with perhaps the best supporting cast featuring john dehner as a morose police captain hans conried and robert emhardt helen of troy and crocodile some of the actors other than those playing kolchak s co workers return in the same roles keenan wynn and ramon bieri both as officers of the law john fiedler as a shrewd morgue attendant and richard kiel as two distinct nemeses of the hero if i were pressed to choose the finest or most entertaining episodes i d lean towards horror in the heights co starring phil silvers and abraham sofaer and the afore mentioned the knightly murders while as the weakest i d go for the werewolf due to reasons i ve already explained and chopper based on a story concocted by robert zemeckis and bob gale unfortunately the set contains no extras it would have been nice to see a featurette discussing the numerous concepts dealt with in kolchak the night stalker as well as putting the series into the context of where tv was at the time of its original airing or even denoting the lasting influence it had on the apparently endless run of sci fi series popular today in fact kolchak himself in a much younger and ostensibly darker guise returned in a revival this version is available at my local dvd rental outlet but for various reasons i m not sure i d want to check it out so soon after the classic
the young dr fanshawe mark letheren an avid archaeologist is dispatched by his museum boss to the large country home of squire richards pip torrens where his task is to find provenance for and catalogue the collection of antiquities and curios belonging to the recently deceased father of the squire the squire is surprised by the arrival fanshawe he hadn t been expecting him for another week but none the less welcomes him and gets his only servant patten david burke of dr watson fame to show him to his room as fanshawe must stay over for some days in order to finish his rather large task patten it would seem is not the friendliest sort and seems to resent the extra work that fanshawe s visit will entail the large empty house providing an endless amount of cooking cleaning and maintenance for him fanshawe is a fussy sort very neat and precise with everything having its place whether they be his clothes or his books and papers and he is rather disgusted by the dirt in his room needless to say he is rather eager to begin his work but unpacking he finds his binoculars have been damaged in transit so he asks the squire for a replacement pair the squire who is a modern thinking man but also it would seem rather uncultured with such matters is also eager to get rid of the clutter around the house so he obliges and walks fanshawe to the top of the hill so that he can survey the estate and the surrounding villages there the squire directs him to points of interest including gallows hill where locals were hung for their crimes and misdemeanours his interest is also taken by a local abbey which the squire describes as a ruin but fanshawe can see through the binoculars that it clearly isn t he investigates further and pays a visit to the site of the abbey and is shocked to find that there are but a few stone remnants fanshawe doesn t have too much time to think about this conundrum as he darkness falls he feels he is being watched he feels a presence he begins to see moving shadows in the woods startled he runs home over dinner he imparts details of his harrowing day to the squire patten overhears the story and suggests an explanation for it the binoculars they used to belong to a local man called baxter whom it would seem collected bones and skulls from gallows hill boiling them up for some concoction or other baxter had disappeared mysteriously one night the late squire had acquired his belongings including a mask made out of a skull and some old etchings of the area these etchings fascinate fanshawe as they portray the abbey he seen through his binoculars but he learns that the abbey had been destroyed during the reign of henry vii and so it would be impossible for baxter to have drawn the sketches never the less they are signed and dated by baxter to the recent past so he concludes that the binoculars have some special power that night he has horrifically vivid dreams when he wakes he sets off with the binoculars to have a closer look at the abbey through them what he finds surprises him but has he put himself in perilous danger by doing so fanshawe finally becomes trapped in his dangerous obsession as darkness falls the squire and a search party go in search of the now missing archaeologist they are alerted by dozens of loudly cawing crows circling above gallows hill they quicken their speed but will they be in time to help or save fanshawe from his destiny the ghost story for christmas series of films made by the bbc sadly ended its initial run of films in with the ice house they were for the most part based on the work of the great m r james in and the series was revived briefly and thankfully a view from a hill also marked a return to the work of james whose ghostly writings have haunted many generations of readers director luke watson being new to the series might have worried fans of the older films but he returns to the period setting abandoned by the later films which immediately sets the tone for a great ghost story his direction is assured as he stays true to the mood of the masters works and gradually builds up the fear factor to a terrifying climax all the while keeping what the viewer sees to a minimum thus upping the tension and mystery the autumn countryside provides oodles of atmosphere the falling leaves and low lying sun providing an unsettling backdrop for the sinister events to come the cast it must be said are all superb and are perfectly cast in their respective roles the idea behind the binoculars is simple but very effective the use of a man made object to see supernatural beings and events that the naked eye cannot see may even have influenced lex de la iglesia in his film la habitaci n del ni o of the following year with which it bears striking similarity i had heard mixed reviews of this particular film but i must say i found it at all times intriguing and it even raised a few hairs on my head and gave me a few shivers something that doesn t happen much these days i think any negativity surrounding the film can only be attributed to its pacing which to my eyes is perfection but to modern audiences it will be seen as deathly slow plenty of time is given even within its brief minutes running time for character development and plot expansion and i must say its a new favourite of mine and certainly one of the better films of the decade
by hook or by crook is a tremendously innovative film from a pair of immensely smart and talented filmmakers harry dodge and silas howard they manage to tell an original story in a distinctive cinematic style and it s beautifully shot by ann t rosetti and wonderfully written truly poetic the lead characters are true heroes and serve as a rare kind of role model inspiration for butch dykes and trannies everywhere this film has so much energy so much poignant passion and scruffy san francisco heart to it i can t recommend it highly enough the best butch buddy movie of all time

perhaps in an attempt to find another hot property for adaptation the brothers fleischer thought back to their highly successful foray into the world of the newspaper comic strip with their production of s popeye the sailor fleischer studios paramount although it was a part of the betty boop series miss b only made a brief appearance in the short leaving the rest as a pilot episode for the possible emergence of a full blown series as is now common knowledge the gruff squinty eyed brawlin seaman became perhaps the most successful cartoon series ever outlasting and literally outliving the fleischers and their studio lasting to this day returning to king features for another try at luck was no doubt the reason for trying out the very popular henry comic strip character in a betty boop outing objective being the seeking of another series the reasoning then surely seemed sound henry was a most popular feature in the hearst papers line up appearing as both a daily and on sunday s color comics supplement puck the comics weekly you know what fools these mortals be remember that one schultz in viewing the chubby little bald boy comic strip hero and his on screen antics both solo and in tandem with miss betty we were pleasantly surprised in seeing just how well the character was handled the story and director dave fleischer both afforded a plethora of comic strip like situations and sight gags that seemed most appropriate for the character of little henry these mostly silent vignettes were very important to the animated film in remaining faithful to the printed page as the henry feature was mostly done in a sort of color mime in the cartoon titled betty boop with henry the funniest living american fleischer studios paramount pictures corporation we see what is basically being a one situational exercise being punctuated with the usual array of dave fleischer s rapid fire machine gun like gags in short henry spots a puppy in the window of betty boop s pet shop it is a sort of love at first sight as henry attempts to purchase the little pup dog with the only money he had to coins in his pocket he is in formed by miss boop that it would be in depression era money to make the purchase tears appear as the little guy leaves dejectedly but a reprieve is soon on the horizon as betty asks the boy to mind the store while she leaves on urgent business in return for his services miss betty promises him the little dog in return of course they have a deal and betty leaves getting to the work of cleaning cages and feeding the livestock affords the opportunity for the fleischer crew to fire up a whole new string of gags this time featuring bird seed henry s bald pate and push brooms but not all at once of course schultz henry s enthusiasm for mass feeding of the store s avian population by first literally seeding his head soon leads to a mass defection of the birds out of the store to the open street in a mass jail break betty returns to this sight and expresses her disappointment and anger with henry s temporary custodial care all bets were off no doggie for henry he begins to leave dejectedly but soon convinces the proprietress to give him another shot at fixing things up his head covered with bird seed he manages to corral all of the little feathered creatures returning them to their pet store coop happily the little fella leaves but this time he has his own affectionate little face licking puppy undoubetly this was a winning combination we have the carefree energy filled free wheeling of the boy the kindness of betty and the emotions of the situation and doubtful outcome of the boy and his dog situation max and dave fleischer had given us a sort of almost minor mini masterpiece of a surreal comedy short we were quite surprised that no henry series followed judging by the fairly faithful treatment of the character it certainly could have been sustained for some time at any rate this teaming was in many ways the best of the betty boop try out pictures although the first popeye the sailor fleischer paramount was the most successful and barely had any betty boop in it save for a cameo as a carnival hula dancer the henry short was much better than the two following king features tryouts betty boop and the little king and betty boop and little jimmy both poodle schnitz
monarch cove was one of the best friday night s drama shown in a long time i am asking the writer to please write a long series and air it on lifetime soon each person was very interesting and did a wonderful job with their lines to make the plot come true however the movie needs to continue for a long time i would love to see bianca and jake s child grow up and get a major role in the movie along with the new grandparents planning for her educational future also bring kathy back to see her niece and help foster her life it was great seeing the grandparents work out their problems but the family business needed to be restored to working status and let us see how jake and bianca survive through the marriage years
this movie is so misunderstood it is not even funny if you think of seeing this one for the shootings stay clear this one deals with the effects and trauma that the survivors must endure even the detectives are seeking the answer we all do why fantastic acting from the two leading ladies as we see how those we ignore are affected by the very same things we are affected with yes the language is harsh at times but it suits the characters well there are some loose ends left or unanswered but all movies have these the major issues are dealt with and this movie makes a major statement about how all of us adults feel after such major incidents highly recommended for teens and adults
seriously i loved this film i had started to read the book and i loved it the way everything was set up and everything had a purpose i think this film did so well was because louis sachar wrote the screenplay and of course andrew davis directed it shia lebouf gives a great performance for his first film the storyline is very cool and interesting there s humor heart and intensity it is very similar to the book i find this film to be not the least bit boring i absolutely loved it and i encourage anyone to read the book all in all this film is very well put together and carefully crafted two thumbs up for me in every single way
retitled from its original japanese name of laputa for being an offensive phrase something which director hayao miyazaki was oblivious to at the time castle in the sky is the master animator s third film and it s one of his most beloved of all time initially a box office disappointment in its release it has since been embraced by critics and audiences around the world inspired by jonathan swift s gulliver s travels castle in the sky is a steampunk themed action adventure tale about two young orphans young miner pazu and mysterious girl sheeta who wears a magic crystal around her neck who team up to find the long lost island of laputa which is rumored to have great riches and gems they are aided by a band of bumbling yet sympathetic air pirates led by the feisty dola who at first chase them yet turn out to be true allies and pursued by the government headed by its villainous topmost secret agent muska who wants the power of laputa for his own benefit for anyone looking for an exciting way to spend two hours this film is an excellent choice featuring just the right amount of humor exploration wonder and mystery to keep one interested the artwork although not as spectacular as in some of miyazaki s later movies is fantastic and gorgeous enough to watch with imaginative characters and locations incredibly exciting action scenes and breathtaking flight sequences that will make one feel giddy and while the characters that populate this tale are less complex than miyazaki s other works each has a memorable endearing personality that stays with the viewer long after the film is over dola in particular makes for a terrific comic character shouting orders to her dimwitted sons one moment and being protective of sheeta the next muska is one of the few miyazaki creations to ever come across as an irredeemable villain but like dola he commands every scene he s in with a sinister charisma that is both alluring and chilly anime fans have often compared this movie to gainax s sci fi adventure series nadia the secret of blue water after all both works share similar story and character elements not to mention that they were both created by miyazaki himself where both differ is in their execution nadia although charming for the most part suffered from taking a wrong turn at its midway point devolving into cartoonish nonsense which all but distracted from the main plot even though it did have a strong ending castle in the sky on the other hand remains consistently entertaining and focused for its two hour running time and is all the better for it while the film s epic tone is sometimes broken up by some cartoonish moments like a brawl between pazu s boss and one of dola s sons it s never to the point that it detracts from the film about eleven years ago disney released an english version featuring a cast of big names such as james van der beek anna paquin cloris leachman mark hamill mandy patinkin as well as some cameo appearances by veterans such as tress macneille and jim cummings it also features an ambitious reworking of joe hisaishi s gorgeous musical score for a performance by the seattle music orchestra interestingly the man behind this rescore is none other than the composer himself as much as purists have cried blasphemy over this version for its occasional extra dialogue and the aforementioned rescore miyazaki had no such problems in fact he is said to have applauded the reworking and for good reason because the newly rerecorded music is truly the star of the new dub while there are some instances where filling in some critially silent scenes from the original japanese is a bit jarring notably the journey through a dragon infested storm cloud the overall reworking is fantastic and in many ways improves on the original particularly in scenes such as when a robot attacks a fortress and the climactic moments toward the end here hisaishi displays his musical versatility and genius for matching music to visuals as far as the performances in the dub go the leads are probably at the short end of the stick james van der beek s pazu sounds significantly more mature than his character while anna paquin s sheeta speaks with an odd accent that fluctuates at times a problem which actually works in favor of the character that said both do good jobs overall and provide a fairly believable chemistry throughout it s the lively supporting cast however that really make this dub so much fun particularly cloris leachman s dola and mark hamill s muska both are perfectly cast and steal every scene they re in as with the rescore these two really warrant a listen to the disney dub the script adaptation borders on the loose side at times there s quite a bit of extra lines and or commentary some of which are pricelessly funny and others somewhat overdone but aside from at least one debatable alteration sheeta s speech in the climactic showdown the world cannot live without love as opposed to the original you can t survive apart from mother earth the overall characters story and spirit remain fairly faithful to the original on the whole there is little point comparing the disney version to the original language track each puts their own stamp on this legendary masterpiece and i like them both they re also better than streamline jal s more literal but frightfully robotic lifeless abysmally acted and poorly written older dub from the late s don t believe anybody who says this version is superior to disneys trust me the opposite is true either way though you can t go wrong with castle in the sky it s one of miyazaki s all time greatest and i highly recommend it
the story has been told before a deadly disease is spreading around but the extra in this film is peter weller his interpretation of muller on the run is real he is indeed a desperate person just going home to see his child this person could be working next to you
the dazzling seventeen minute dance sequence of george gershwin s orchestral piece an american in paris is an indisputable masterwork choreographed with precision and unparalleled flair by gene kelly the vibrant combination of color music and dance is still eye poppingly startling as the piece is broken down into scenes inspired by selected master artists dufy in the opening place de la concorde piece manet in the flower market utrillo in a paris street rousseau at the fair vincent van gogh in the spectacular place de l opera piece and toulouse lautrec for the moulin rouge where kelly wears his famous white bodysuit the minutes that precede this finale are not as exciting not by a long shot but there are certain charms to be had in viewing the entire oscar winning musical director vincente minnelli and screenwriter alan jay lerner have fashioned a surprisingly sophisticated if rather slight romantic story focused on jerry mulligan a former g i who has remained in paris after the end of wwii trying to make a living as a painter with his braggadocio manner and athletic dancing style gene kelly can be concurrently ingratiating and irritating as a screen personality but he seems to find his oeuvre as the carefree jerry the love triangle plot is focused on jerry s involvement with milo roberts a self proclaimed art patron but a sexual predator when it comes to young artists on their first date in a crowded montmartre nightclub jerry unapologetically falls for lise a young woman who turns out to be the fianc e of henri a professional entertainer and friend of jerry s pal adam an out of work concert pianist romantic complications ensue until the inevitable ending but not before several classic gershwin songs are performed the best of these is the most imitated a swooningly romantic song and dance to our love is here to stay along a faux seine river in a blue hazy mist with yellow fog lights the way kelly and leslie caron circle each other is transcendent as they approach each other tentatively at first and then synchronize beautifully to the music leading to the final clinch few films have so elegantly and succinctly shown two people falling in love i got rhythm and s wonderful spotlight kelly s nimble tap dancing and agreeable singing while embraceable you is danced impressively by caron in a five scene montage of henri s all over the map description of lise to adam designed to show off caron s dancing versatility the sequence is similar to the one in on the town where vera ellen showed off her considerable dancing skills when kelly s sailor character described his multi faceted vision of miss turnstiles as lise the nineteen year old caron in her first film dances superbly throughout and handles her role with unformed charm with her acting talent not to bloom for several years looking quite glamorous nina foch plays older as the manipulative milo and manages to be likable enough for us to care about her fate while oscar levant is just his sardonic self as adam performing an elegant i ll build a stairway to paradise george gu tary plays henri so agreeably that you feel bad that he does lose the girl at the end this is not the best all around mgm musical but there is certainly enough movie magic to make this quite worthwhile the dvd contains a fairly pristine print but little else in terms of extras
i read the negative comments before viewing this film and undeterred went ahead and started watching i admit that i had to rewind quite a few times as the film is incredibly complex involved and full of detail that is a good thing but also quite unexpected in this culture of car chases explosions gratuitous sex and general violence that substitute for plot and character development in fact what a welcome departure however i am so used to not paying a lot of attention to what i watch this film is chock full of character development and plot line the kind that we used to analyze when i was in high school it requires actual mental participation on the part of the viewer what a nice change i would compare it to all the president s men in terms of generic subject matter that is it is a mystery about intense misconduct on the part of elected officials and those with enough influence upon officials to essentially own them unlike all the president s men this film makes an effort to give a couple of the characters actual personality in this sense the movie is a character study like the negotiatior with samuel jackson and kevin spacey in that movie their characters are both city employees and the plot is extremely intense yet the plot is dependent on the ability of their characters to cooperate with each other trust each and ultimately unite together against the corrupt police department there is more gun fire in this film and the specific plot is different but generically there are many similarities i will say that city hall requires a whole lot more concentration in fact i was struck how parallel it was to past and present political scandals i ve seen in my life going back to watergate the thing is the public knows that something is wrong for sure but following the details is hard to do this movie is not even close to being as complex as real life but it actually is realistic to life in its complexity i think that is one of the reasons that previous posters have criticized the film unrealistic expectations if one watches this knowing what they are about to see and are up to the experience it really is excellent i watched it times in a row the acting is superb and the directing is flawless the weakest link is john cusak s accent
this filmfour funded sci fi movie is most definitely a must see while it takes huge influence from the manchurian candidate and offers nothing new or original plot wise it s handled with the utmost skill that it comes off as being fresh and inventive despite it being basically a re run of an earlier film it s good to know that films like this are still being made even if they aren t getting wide releases and cypher is refreshing for that reason the plot twists and turns which gives it an element of paranoia and also serves in keeping the audience on the edge of their seat while trying to figure out the meaning of cypher s mystery the plot follows morgan sullivan a bored suburban man that decides to take a job with digicorp that involves him listening to speeches from several rival companies and recording them for reasons to him unknown however his job is interrupted when he meets a mysterious young lady known as rita this film features a number of stark white backgrounds that give it a very surreal edge and blend well with it s apocalyptic imaging of the future this gives the film a very odd look that sets it apart from the majority of other films of the same type with it s only real close affiliate being kubrick s a clockwork orange the plot is also very efficient and ditches character development in favour of the more stylish and more thrilling plot developing you never quite know where you are with the plot which serves in making it all the more intriguing the acting is largely good with a largely unknown cast backing up the team of stars jeremy northam and lucy lui northam very much looks the part of the quiet and disheartened man at the centre of the tale and does well with his role lucy lui is an actress that has a resume that doesn t quite fit her talent but she has a look about her that just fits this movie cypher is far from perfect as some of the sequences are illogical and at times it can be inconsistent but on the whole if you want an inventive recent sci fi film cypher is the way to go
excellent film the whole picture was filmed in budapest so i feel proud my little problem was that the trains in the film belonged to the hungarian state railways m v and it is plain to see that they were used in big train not in the local railway according to the story chikatilo picked up his victims in local railway stations apart from this the film is superb
an end of an era was released here in the states in spring with the rookie a disney live action film that seemed to be the best for last it took place right here in texas actually the story began in west texas as evidenced by an area code found on a sign over there it was about a high school coach who was so convinced by his high class baseball team that he decided to go professional what i liked about this movie it was sooo nice it was a very good sports movie ala the mighty ducks trilogy it had also taken moviegoers across texas from somewhere between the panhandle and el paso all the way to the metroplex where i live i can tell because i recognize that ballpark was the ballpark in arlington now it s ameriquest field it was nice to see disney s golden age end here in my area r i p golden age of disney s spring it all started with a mouse and it ended with baseball sobs
i am a huge woody allen fan and so when i saw that this was playing at the cinema i couldn t help myself i wanted to see how allen would follow up his magnificent film match point seeing as this is another one of his films shot in g b which is unique among allen s work along with what seems to be his new muse scarlett johanson scoop is much lighter than mp and the humor is scoop s most enjoyable aspect the plot revolves around johanson s character a journalism student who gets a tip on a hot story from beyond the grave she falls in love with a suspected serial killer jackman and she must decide whether the truth is worth finding oh and all of this is done with the help of a bumbling magician turned detective played by allen i must say that i thoroughly enjoyed johanson s performance but i am a bit bias i could watch a three hour film with johanson in ever frame and remain enchanted she plays a ditsy yappy bumbling sweetheart that is kind of a variation in a sense of allen s stereotypical neurosis stricken character she adds appropriate body language for comic effect needless to say almost anyone who sees this will find johanson s character sickeningly cute and that is a plus allen is allen he is still playing the same character much like chaplin and his little tramp character something that occur in this film makes me wonder if i will see the neurotic little hypochondriac again however he is not in the cast of his next picture and has been spending more time exclusively behind the camera as of late jackman is also enjoyable as the suave millionaire murder suspect i cannot say that jackman does anything in particular to make the role his but he suits his character none the less in terms of the plot i cannot help but feel that this is fresh in fact it stinks of curse of the jade scorpion johanson and allen are more detective like than anything however i must applaud allen on his ending because it is a bit more clever than your typical unoutstanding hollywood version of this film instead of everything being black and white things are painted in shades of gray being entirely innocent has nothing to do with it nor does unequivocal guilt though the plot seemed old woody still has a knack for one liners i did find his allusions to his last film interesting come for the humor laugh and be merry needless to say if you enjoy allen s work watch it if not watch something else
have you ever wished that you could escape your dull and stressful life at school or work and go on a magical adventure of your own with one of your closest friends at your side facing all sorts of dangers and villains and unraveling the mystery of a lost civilization that s just waiting for someone to discover all its secrets even if you re not quite that much of a fantasy lover have you ever wished you could simply experience what it s like to be a kid again and not have a care in the world for just a couple of hours this is exactly what miyazaki s castle in the sky is all about pazu a young but very brave and ambitious engineer lives a rustic life in a mining town until one day a girl named sheeta falls down from the sky like an angel and takes him on a journey to a place far beyond the clouds while all the while they have pirates and military units hot on their trail simply put it is just the incredible adventure that every kid dreams of at one point or another and i can t help but feel my worries melt away every time i see it as it is one of miyazaki s older works and takes much place in the everyday world the film is not as visually spectacular or deep in its storyline as spirited away howl s moving castle or even princess mononoke still i find it difficult to say that any of these films are superior over the other because all three of those films are at some point or another mystical to the point of being enigmatic if not perplexing especially for the youngest of viewers castle in the sky on the other hand doesn t try so much to be an allegory of any kind and it s not a coming of age story either it is instead quite possibly one of the best depictions of the inside of a child s mind i ve ever seen not only is the artwork beautiful but the use of perspective from the kids eyes is just amazing whether it s the panning up of the camera to see the enormous trees or clouds overhead or the incredible sense of height from looking down at the ground or ocean while hundreds of feet in the air i just can t help but feel like i m there with pazu and sheeta just a kid in another world far far away from reality even the kids themselves don t have a complex relationship that suggests a need for hope like ashitaka san or chihiro haku sheeta is pazu s angel having literally fallen into his life from the sky one day the absolutely perfect person for him right from the very start as the film progresses more and more of their true adventurous childhood spirit comes out through their kind words and beautifully realistic facial expressions not only are they an adorable reminder of who i used to be but their endearing friendship never lets up throughout the whole film only growing stronger all the way to the last frame for that reason i ve fallen in love with the two of them more than i have with any other miyazaki couple at the same time castle in the sky is such an easily accessible film because no matter what kind of casual moviegoer you may be you ll be sure to find your fix here mystery action drama comedy suspense sci fi romance even some western it s all here just about everything people go to the movies for except maybe horror this why i can easily recommend it as a first miyazaki film it s perfect for those who have no expectations from having already seen the incredible otherworldliness of some of his more recent works even the ending song of the film when translated into english conveys the sense of longing for the discovery of some kind of lost civilization and some kind of soul mate that could not be found in our mundane lives the reason i long for the many lights is that you are there in one of them the earth spins carrying you carrying us both who ll surely meet miyazaki has always provided poetic lyrics to make ending songs out of joe hiasashi s gorgeous scores but this is the only one i ve seen that s both a touching love song and an inspirational dream i have found myself near tears just listening to it castle in the sky may not be miyazaki s most developed spectacular or meaningful work but it s absolutely perfect for what it really was meant to be a true vision of childhood fantasy and a wonderful escape from reality for any adults who wish they could have the same wonderful sense of imagination they had when they were just carefree little kids sit back relax and love it for what it is
this film pulls you in from the get go because it grabs our attention by acknowledging yeah that this story is opening with a clich a funeral in hands other than judi s i wouldn t have given it an as this material has been done over and over again the great reunion of a once famous pick one please team army platoon theatre group singers band but this movie never stoops to cheap sentimentalization and when you think it is going to it swoops off in another direction a case in point is the flowers that are sent by an admirer to judi the band members are an interesting group and ride above the clich s too one is in jail one has found religion one is an alkie and one has sunk into dementia but the joie de vivre rediscovered by judi ignited by her granddaughter s interest carries us along and makes us overlook the sometimes simplistic nature of the plot the cast are a who s who of talent leslie caron the incomparable jazzist cleo laine with her amazing high notes a last performance from joan sims brava joan a cute as a button flirtatious ian holm having a ball and olympia dukakis as a money grabbing divorc e living in the highlands of scotland with her ghillie and her whiskey the closing scene is standard hollywoodland fare the judgmental children of the star converted to fun loving supporters the old lovers reunited the youngsters swept up in the old timers music life should be this simple but i would watch it again and intend to with my own granddaughter for in the right hands sometimes one just loves these brazen old clich s out of
it was easy for sir richard attenborough to make gandhi he was merely narrating a story of a great individual who walked on this planet not so long ago comparatively it must have been a lot tougher for director feroz abbas khan making his debut as a filmmaker to make gandhi my father pitting a shriveled anti hero against an international hero both of whom were historically real individuals and ironically father and son the events in the film are mostly real mahatma gandhi lived as shown in the film setting high moral standards for the world to follow yet these very standards overshadowed the aspirations of his eldest son harilal to be a lawyer of repute like his father to complete his education and get a job in india and thus provide income for his nuclear family the film does not debunk gandhi and his ideals for gandhi his mission was larger than his family s aspirations he loved his family and cared for them though his thoughts for their appeasement were blinkered by his ideal of caring for the masses he stood for equality and dignity among all persons and in his view to give special undue advantages to his own son overlooking other deserving persons went against the basis of what he preached the film looks at an unusual case of parenting where an idealist parent places receding goalposts for a less than brilliant offspring the film presents an unusual scenario that happened a son marries his childhood sweetheart upsetting his father the father upsets his son s educational aspirations at several key junctures the fragile link between a devoted son and a father breaks as the son wants to stand on his own feet and care for his nuclear family while the father gradually becomes the father of a nation the son stumbles in valiant quest for identity and survival his marriage breaks and seeks solace in religion buffeting between islam and hinduism through all his tribulations his link to his mother remains until she chides him for being drunk feroz khan is essentially a director of plays making his foray into cinema he wrote and directed the play mahatma vs gandhi that had considerable impact on the indian theater community the play and the consequent film were based on two biographies one by chandulal dalal and another by nilamben parekh the success of the staged play was an evident reason for the commercial bollywood actor anil kapoor to produce this noteworthy film every time a good director of plays attempts to direct cinema there is an evidence of a lack of confidence with the medium peter brook is a great director of plays but less competent as a film director the opening shots of khan s film promises great cinema a derelict harilal gandhi is brought to sion hospital bombay mumbai barely mumbling that his father is bapu the popular name of mahatma gandhi father to an entire nation the hospital authorities do not recognize him to be mahatma gandhi s eldest son dying in poverty and loneliness apart from the dramatic opening the film unfortunately merely presents a great story and some superb exterior shots of father and son meditating in silhouette for an indian film it does present some high production qualities that go hand in hand with a lack of interest for details the clothes of most indians in the film seem dust free and freshly laundered modern hairstyles of actors and even shefali shetty playing mohandas gandhi s wife a century ago with plucked eyebrows the bane of indian cinema since feroz khan is a theater personality he has invested much more effort in working with the actors in developing the characters rather than on cinematic details somewhat like sir attenborough another person who is also a product of theater royal academy of dramatic arts knowing quite well that to criticize gandhi in any manner was asking for trouble even when there was no direct criticism in the film producer anil kapoor took a remarkable decision of not putting up posters of the film at accessible heights in india fearing that some one could tear the poster or disrespect it intentionally or unintentionally with all its mix of greatness and faults gandhi my father throws several questions at the viewer is a mother son bonding stronger than a father son bonding in parenting is one s immediate family less important than humanity at large does one seek refuge in religion and alcohol only when worldly troubles are encountered in this film harilal buffeted by adversities runs from one religion to another while his father quotes scriptures forgive them for they know not what they do when beaten and thrown on the ground by a south african policeman convinced of the value of religion and convincing others as well the film won the best actress award at the tokyo international film festival for shefali shetty shah and an indian award from critics feroze khan and anil kapoor have handled a sensitive subject very well and elicited above average performances from the ensemble of actors i do hope the international success of the film paves the way for some able director to film another brilliant indian play girish karnad s tughlaq some day meeting international quality standards
all of those who voted less than are obviously not fans of clean tongue in cheek humor keaton is brilliant in this as in most of his work this is not a blockbuster bigger than life affair this is campy slapstick humor played out by some of hollywood s best and very versatile actors piscopo was equally on the mark as the top dog wannabee once if you want to see the funniest attempt at not really cussing ever filmed you gotta see dimitri do his piece as morone i gave it a
a thief in the night is a film that was generally ignored by movie fans at large due to its low budget which was obvious and its subject matter the rapture of true christian church and the fate of those left behind nevertheless it was a gripping story that held the viewer and definitely made him or her review their relationship with jesus christ it touched everyone showing even a pastor who preached the word but did not believe it knowing exactly why he was left behind this movie and its sequel distant thunder are must see movies even with the new left behind series coming out telling the same story with a much higher budget the impact is still the same a thief in the night broke the ground of this genre and will always be remembered
as i saw the movie i was really shocked to see what the s was about i know i may be wrong about some things but it seemed like the s really had an effect on people of the time some people said they would want to go back to the s from what i saw i would say yes for the excitement and no for the outcome but that s my opinion
i initially bought this dvd because it had srk and aishwarya rai on the cover and i thought hey another film starring aishu and shah rukh little did i know that aishwarya would only appear in an item number in the last quarter of the film in a song which she shares with srk and helps introduce his character who is in the film for about just minutes shakti is a film about a mother s love and endurance it s a film about transformations ignorance coming of age stepping into the know and embracing the harsh realities of life the item number in which srk and aishu appear in has nothing to do with the movie it s actually a dream sequence that occurs while srk s drunken character is knocked unconscious by booze he dreams that aishwarya rai is this sexy street girl who shows up at his favourite hangout spot one day dressed scantily and begins to seduce him the title of the song is ishq kamina loosely translated as love s a bitch and it is just plain smoking hot don t miss it
i saw this movie when it was new later i rented it in japan after having been here three years afraid that i would cringe when i viewed it in the harsh light of my expanded international experience the movie pleasantly surprised me with how accurately it portrays the culture clash between japan and pennsylvania where i m from not all the stuff is factually spot on but the tone is perfect i m still in japan many years later and i continue to enjoy this film for its even handed treatment of the two sides in the story interestingly although the japanese american actors spoke japanese in the original the dialog is redubbed in the japan version to cover up obvious second language delivery problems i noticed one reviewer uses this in a japanese class i think you can learn more about what to expect from an encounter with japan by watching this film than by reading any of the serious books on the matter most of which were written in the s and financed by propagandizing japanese companies don t be fooled by drag on the average rating caused by one star reviewers who among other things found it implausible that the japanese would want to build cars in the us of course the japanese operate many factories there to be close to the customers and to avoid trade friction this is a very warm and funny movie that i would rate higher were it not for a few s clich s like the dancing around to cheesy electronic disco music michael keaton has never been funnier
convicts is very much a third act sort of film all the dialogue and character interaction that occurs within it comes out of the long wind down of a late southern day and by extension the life of its main character soll robert duvall this is the first collaboration of director peter masterson and writer horton foote six years earlier the worked together on the trip to bountiful a film that seems almost action packed in comparison to this one masterson is not necessarily a good director in fact he s just barely this side of adequate the slow pace leaves a lot of room for cinematographer toyomichi kurita who infuses the film with just the right sense of fragile light warmth because this is essentially a filmed play with little in the way of editing or directing prowess it all comes to the acting as far as i m concerned there s no flaws here robert duvall and james earl jones two of the best american actors both born in january create characters that are wholly real uninterested in anything besides living lukas haas a young actor who i was familiar with from testament and witness plays a character very much like his other early roles he is quiet withdrawn slightly scared and sad somehow these are qualities that seem natural from him perhaps a title like convicts is a disservice to this film that title along with the opening scene seem to create an image of a far more high strung western type picture if slow paced stage productions don t interest you terribly you ll want to pass on this one as well otherwise this might be exactly the film you wish they made more often enjoy
i love this film and it is such a wonderful example of a family jeopardy a romantic love story and a very sad story plot everything was just so perfect and excellent about this film it was such a great mixture of actors and actresses and with some laughs and a lot of cries this film deserves to get plenty of awards with the mention of beautiful scenario and although i would relate this film to the notebook and the family stone it was sort of much more cunning sad and brilliant than those films the evening tells of a love story between an old woman dreaming back to her younger years and her two daughters stay by her side while she is not well the story dating back is so strongly told and wonderful i was sitting on the edge of my seat you really get to know all the characters and by the end i was wanting to watch it all over again this is a amazingly sad and vividly acted and plotted movie that is really one of a kind and should be seen by all for how wonderful it really is all the performances are astonishing and the film captures your attention from the very beginning and never lets go i loved it and am so glad that i watched it for it was truly an astonishing film
broadway and film actor turned director john cassavetes from rosemary s baby creates a masterpiece with this film it stars gena rowlands john cassavetes himself ben gazzara joan blondell paul stewart zohra lampert laura johnson and there is a cameo by peter falk the premise of the film an aging stage and film actress gena rowlands re evaluates her life after an obscessed fan dies in a car accident trying to get her autograph the movie has a slow pace and a dark moody frightening quality it has a s cinematic look and it even reminded me of polanski s rosemary s baby without the supernatural horror the fears here are the ones every successful actress has she is getting old and she will become useless in her career furthermore she feels she has lived a life that lacks any true spirituality humanity and merit she has lived only for her career she has no children doesn t do charitable deeds etc the gradual disintegration of her personality is the meat of this film she is falling apart she s in a crisis gena rowlands really gets into the character s tormented psyche and acts the part quite well she is a terrific actress and this s film is a refreshing contrast to the often violent films of the period and or the disaster movies or adventure thrillers it s a movie with lots of deep seated emotion but has a cold cynical feeling as if cassavetes is criticizing the mainstream movies and actors of the s generation either that or this movie is a product of the s which was itself cynical in many aspects nixon s deception watergate vietnam etc although the production values are not great and this film is not well known it s a very haunting film with haunting moods kudos to the underrated and late director cassavetes who died in the late s
i saw dick tracy when i was very young i didn t know who any of the actors were and i didn t know the movie would turn out different than the way it was previewed i sure loved it though warren beatty stars as the crime fighting s detective dick tracy who goes after the biggest mob bosses in the city this time big boy caprice al pacino has killed a very powerful man and is out to take over the city with his singer girlfriend breathless mahoney madonna who has her eye on tracy it becomes even worse because a new criminal is invading and the worst part is this criminal has no face he or she is very unknown plus the famous villians are back from the comic book collection i thought that this movie was very colorful and creative it was entertaining and fun to watch especially as a child warren beaty was just like james bond of the s the way he played dick tracy an ensemble cast of the film includes charlie korsmo glenn headly william forsythe dustin hoffman james caan ed o ross tommy lee jones mandy patinkin charles durning plus more dick tracy is a movie for all ages and is a fun movie for a family to enjoy take my word for it
this film has slipped through the cracks of film history it is by far much better than some other new york films of the same era such as the french connection or the taking of pelham there is a gritty reality to this film which also manages to effectively use humor to further the plot line it s engaging from start to finish and hasn t tarnished with age as is the case with the above two examples ron liebman turns in a bravura performance as batman and it s a shame his career didn t take off as a result of this project gordon parks directs and coming as it does after shaft it at first appears to be a strange choice yet it is the flip side of that earlier effort and approached with just as much in your face machismo unfortunately this film has not been made available on either dvd or vhs in the united states united artists really has a gem on their hands and it s a shame they re not doing anything with it
such a film of beauty that it s hard to describe maybe it s the absence of superfluous dialogue or maybe it s the absolutely stellar soundtrack or maybe it s just meena mumari s feet but it s a joy to watch this movie again and again i ve never seen another indian movie that comes close to it and few from any country rival its perfection
why does this have such a low rating i really don t get it is it because of the bad acting the bad dialogue well who cares about these things in cheesy low budget horror movies seriously the acting and the dialogue isn t important in those movies people who hate movies only because of bad acting and bad dialogue shouldn t be allowed to rate cheesy low budget movies those movies shouldn t be taken seriously period anyway time to talk about the movie right well i loved it i bought it because i expected a gorefest but it s not a gorefest and the gore is pretty bad most of the time it s just animal guts placed on the body of the actors and that s lame but i didn t really care because the movie is hilarious the characters are hilarious the acting is hilarious bad acting is a good thing in cheesy low budget horror movies the dialogue is hilarious bad dialogue is a good thing in cheesy low budget horror movies the zombie rapist with a huge dick is hilarious the flying demon baby is hilarious and i could go on and on and on but i don t want to say too much but i have to mention that there s a scene in which a girl masturbates a sex doll like it s alive lol oh and the zombie rapist falls in love with the sex doll lol best lines in the movie detective manners sniffs coke detective sloane what the beep are you doing manners what the hell did you snort what the hell is that detective manners it s nothing man it s ehh cold medicine detective manners injects heroin in his arm detective sloane what the beep are you doing manners are you beep insane detective manners it s cold medicine detective manners repeatedly kicks a random guy in the face detective sloane what the hell s going on manners what are you doing detective manners this maniac was rambling about demons and then he started smashing his head on the rock he just started smashing his head on the rock i think he s on pcp or something lol
a beautiful piece of children s cinema buried in a world of archaic celticism setting the story around the famous book of kels believed to have been comprised by monks from the small island of iona off the western coast of scotland telling the tale of a young abbots apprentice who goes off into the forest in search of crom cruic the fierce headless horseman of pagan mythology in hopes of recovering a lost artefact the films true beauty lies in its animation cell shaded in a bright and inspirational style of deep complexity resulting in a look of seem less simplicity deriving much from the artistic style of the brilliant cartoon network series samurai jack for its genius use of mark making and background depth the secret of kels creates a consistently affective celtic world living under the shadow of viking invasion the history may be intensely inaccurate and the ways of life portrayed lacking realism but these facts are utterly irrelevant as the film sets itself in a world of fantasy and celtic revivalist mysticism the girl of the forest is a wonderful addition and in my opinion makes the picture what it is as she glides from branch to branch appearing and disappearing like a mysterious nymph with qualities resembling the legendary cheshire cat from alice and wonderland the secret of kels is an absolute treat for all genders all ages it s a lovely piece of family cinema don t expect to be awed but instead pleasantly impressed
as usual sean connery does a great job lawrence fishburn is good but i have a hard time not seeing him as ike turner
what the movie the s really represents to those of us who growled around in the belly of america in those times is the turbulence and diversity of the decade despite the exaggerated stereotyped characters the genuineness of the issues remains clear not only were those radical times of change but also very confusing times two basic things changed our world then the civil rights act and the overwhelming influence of the media those two new freedoms began social changes that soon became institutionalized from chaos came sensitivity from disorder came values bear in mind however that the bulk of americans were not involved in this they worked they played they watched the news and slowly they became effected by the efforts and struggles of the minorities the civil rights workers the political activists the anti war efforts the war on poverty the representation of the power of the press and tv in particular was well reflected although the conflict between the general public s attitude and those seeking to change things was at best ignored and at worst misrepresented middle class americans weren t all standing around angrily holding baseball bats or disowning their wayward daughters they were confused too let us not forget how folk singers suddenly became protest singers and how the beatles began an onslaught that killed the folk protest movement there are no beatle songs in the movie or even any mention of them i think if you didn t live the decade you might not have a sense of what the movie is about the overall picture is a bit dim at one point i held down a steady job while my sister lived at the hog farm commune and went to woodstock at another point i was in haight asbury and in the detroit riots while she worked and played the housewife in maine and connecticut roles were constantly changing the movie depicts three siblings of a middle class family they represent the hippie child the political activist and the active military personnel dad represents the typical attitudes and mom represents the voice of reason tolerance and sometimes compromise for the sake of peace the black family comprises a minister and his son disproportionately i think i assume the producers knew all the variables and had to settle on limitations or else the film would have become a long boring documentary dad s message was that anger produces bitterness and bitterness produces chaos it was clearly a message directed to today s youth we are looking at a unique solution to social problems and also how issues divide us the s were unusual in that way and only the roaring s compare in other words this movie has a moral after all in the end it is our collective individualism that survives put that in your oxymoron list everyone was a god a guru or a free spirited genius in the s it was a time of magic and madness no one will ever nail the s down right it was too diverse this movie is close at least we can say we are not ashamed of it that we learned and grew from it and that for once a generation shaped and changed america for the better
this is possibly the best short crime drama i ve ever seen the acting is superb especially amanda burton who s character goes from scary to sweet to disturbing to sad and then some she does an amazing job balancing rachels carlas feelings and acting out the pain of someone who s lost a child its so believable that it feels more like a real life story then a drama the other actors are of course great too which they usually are in british tv film the ending which i m not going to give away is fantastic mainly because you don t really get one you ll get what i mean after you ve seen it this is well worth buying and seeing over and over again and if you re not touched by this you re one cold hearted person
i thought that this film was very well made heath leger was very convincing and his irish accent was flawless orlando bloom and naomi watts were also really good and believable how true it is to what really happened i have no idea but it did portray why people sometimes become what they do maybe those in authority have always been corrupt and i did find it interesting that over signed a petition for ned kelly not to be hanged so maybe there was more truth in this film than at first thought in many ways it reminded me of cold mountain which was another good historical film all in all i would highly recommend this film and i am somewhat baffled why it didn t do better in the cinemas
laputa castle in the sky is the bomb the message is as strong as his newer works and more pure fantastic and flying pirates how could it be any better the art is totally amazing and the soundtrack which is reused many times after this im not sure if this was the first time i heard it and evokes in me the most emotional sentimental response of any movie soundtrack sheeta the female lead in this movie is totally awesome and the boy pazu is also a great role model he lives on his own the plot is classic miyazaki i won t give it away but the end is really great i rank this as one of miyazaki s three best with nausicaa and spirited away also you may want to check out howl s moving castle when it comes out sometime next year i hope if you like miyazaki check this one out as it readily available in the usa enjoy piper a
peaches is truly a marvelous film i write this to refute a review from someone called auscrit that has appeared on this site first of all the idea that either monahans first film the interview is somehow tv is an extraordinary statement here is a film that has been significantly praised around the world as is simply one of the best australian films ever made it fully deserved to win best picture peaches is a brave bold and courageous departure for me it works on every level and i have now seen it twice monahan is a filmmaker who is demonstrating great skill and incredible sensitivity for auscrit to make the comment that it is another tv movie etc and that hugo weaving is no good simply does not get the film or more particularly does not want to get it frankly it is the sort of comment that one expects from either another filmmaker who is jealous or bitter or both or someone from inside the industry either distribution exhibition or bureaucracy your average punter i have found just does not write comments like that i have noticed other comments on the site and reference to the film sommersault one has to wonder what people think they are looking at unfortunately in australia at the time ss was released the push was if you did not like it then there was something wrong with you not the film this manipulation of the media is pretty common down under the reality is the only similarity between the two films are that they are rights of passage films unfortunately for me ss is a film about nothing that could have been told in minutes i see it as a one dimensional film about anxiety peaches in comparison is a master piece personally i cannot wait to what monahan does next as he is clearly way ahead of any of his contemporaries when it comes to cinema in conclusion if the film does not win all at this years afi s and if awards then it is a rigged game as for auscrit please find something more constructive do with your time
this film surprised me a little i watch a lot of horror sci fi films and this is a straight to video release that caught me off guard a little i believe this is full moon s best movie thus far and one of jeffrey combs best performances good movie
i just watched this movie by mistake what a little gem this film made in looks and feels like a late seventies movie and is in fact better more restrained and correct than say blue soldier the environmental anthropological undertones are way ahead of its time the understated cinematography is superb and terribly realistic much more than dances with wolves the last hunt manages to convey the look and feel of the buffalo killing fields of the late s probably because those in the movie were real killing fields the movie was shot during legal forestry directed buffalo culls so the animals you see are really being shot the bones are real in conclusion a very under rated western masterpiece superbly acted directed and shot
this is a thinking man s silly movie if you don t expect star wars and enjoy british humor this might just turn into a cult classic for you as it has for my wife and i from casting the voice of cary grant and jack nicholson as martians to the overly simplistic populace of big bean this is a movie that you can either sleep through or watch carefully and enjoy either way it s not for everyone but if you enjoy relaxing easy humor that takes a quick mind to see the joke as it slips by you will enjoy this movie
mulholland drive made me the definitive fan of david lynch he s a modern genius because he s not only a film maker his stories and his style have a spell that cross the screen so the straight story was quite a surprise to me with its easy to follow storyline and sunny sets still lynch is there and while this is far from his best it s a film not to be missed late richard farnsworth s performance is one of the reasons
this is a tepid docu drama that covers no new ground reworks all the cliches and is sloppy with facts for example munich is a very flat city so why is it hilly in the movie for example the end of the great war in was not a surrender but an armistice yet it is announced as a surrender for example european news vendors did not and do not shout headlines as they hawk their papers yet this strictly american custom is employed in the film for example the nazis did not adopt the german eagle until after they had taken power but there it is on the lectern as hitler delivers one of his stem winders indeed most of this disappointing production consists of little more than hitlerian oratory the movie also perpetuates the myth that the beer hall putsch was hatched at the munich hoffbrauhaus it was not robert carlyle does a fine portrayal of his subject but his supporting cast is adequate at best and very often not even that these comments are based on the first episode only one only can hope the second will be better but don t bet on it

this movie is a brilliant lesson on japanese history set in at the end of the tokugawa shogunate shortly before the shogunate lost a big battle against the loyalist who wanted the emperor back on the throne to rule japan really i had to read a lot of history to get the entire background shintaro katsu also known as the original zatoichi gives a superb performance as izo okada one of the four hitokiri human slayer of the bakumatsu he is a simple samurai who looses all of his wealth in order to have a good life he becomes a retainer of takechi hanpei played by tatsuya nakada ryonosuke out of sword of doom hanpei is a ultra nationalist politician who lets his band of hitokiri assassinate a lot of high ranking pro west politicians in order to achieve his political goals izo okada follows his leader without really questioning what they are doing as long as he has money to go and drink and spend at his whore okada s killings get more and more brutal in the course of the movie and he is proud to have a reputation based on fear wherever he goes it is a splendid portrait on the life of a simple samurai who gets caught up in political affairs and is really to naive to realize what is happening first after being betrayed and tortured and always having talks with sakamoto who is a samurai who rejects violence does he change his ideas and views on life but too late watch the movie to see the end of izo okada shintaro katsu and the rest of the staff give a brilliant performance each actor reaches up to their role the sword fights a very unique and fast probably faster than several movies nowadays check it out if you have the chance

one of the most disturbing and tragic periods in american history began the members of the summer of love culture at the end of the seventies and onset of the s were eventually tool old for love beads and all night parties and evolved back into mainstream life whatever that meant for those who could not out grow their youthful and sometimes irrational exuberance their s was the culture of wonderland a love for drugs and a sense of entitlement coupled with a distaste for authority values and the establishment is the world that the film captures the sixties were a time of revolution and violent change that tore the american house apart once the battles were over we all had to deal with the aftermath of the carnage the characters in the wonderland house are icons of the misfits of the seventies part biker part hippie part crook all outcast no ideology to express just a sense of dissatisfaction with everything and allegiance to nothing ron billy and david fancy themselves as some sort of robin hoods with dope they talk of love and behave violently they take from the rich and sell to the misbegotten they steal from everyone holmes and company are the end result of a strange collision of anti matter like sex and drugs and rock roll when the lab technicians get bored and move on the film is skillfully directed and paced and captures the frenetic world of the drug fiends in their element the fact that holmes is a porn star is almost irrelevant that story was told in boogie nights this is a story of a transitional and forgettable era
i have to say that this is one of the best movies i have ever seen i was bored and looked through the t v and found home room and it was already in about min but i got hooked it was so interesting and moving it shows what can happen in anyone s life i give it a more if possible the director writer and actors did an amazing job i think teens should watch this movie and will learn from it it was great drama mystery and more i cried for hours i think that the director writer should write more movies like this one i loved it i didn t even know about this movie which is sad because it was so good i wish it could go in the movies for more people to see
while the movie does feel a bit long at times it is well worth it gordon directs in a style that reminds you of vonneguts writing styles merciless thoughtful ironic quirky and dark this is a film which will stay with you for quite a while begging for answers to impossible questions nolte goodman and arkin are all incredible sheryl lee is wonderful as well in a role that will remind us lynch fans of her laura maddy days do not miss this one
kurosawa fresh into color losses sight of his usual themes of truth and perception of reality and opts for a depressing take on tokyo s slums kurosawa stretches for a style that was in my opinion his antithesis that is to say i feel as if kurosawa wanted to make an ozu picture poorly paced poorly conceived this movie is a rare dud in this auteur body of excellent work while ikiru while being mundane and depressing was still interesting and well paced and while stray dog depicted the slums and social poverty of japan without being too heavy handed or boring do desu ka den has all the somberness that one could expect with its content with none of the redeeming qualities of earlier kurosawa pictures be warned this is not a movie that kurosawa should be judged by
lost holds something interesting for everyone you can say an awfully lot about this series and an awfully lot has been said so i won t be the one to spell it all out for you again just read the persons who loved it and you ll know why you want to watch it the nice thing about this series is that its totally new there are not much movies and even fewer series based on the theme of only suspense but lost lives up to the theme with pride its all about the unexplained and if you combine that with an exotic location nice plot twists an excellent cast and a good format present and past combined in single episodes you ll have a series in which every episode is a story on its own but part of a greater telling you want to have all the insights of the characters you want to see the overall picture and you ll want to know where the writers are taking you the result of that is that its a series which does not let you go on a more sceptic note the series went under a bit in season probably due to its own success it is well known that lost was only written for one season originally and when the overwhelming success followed the writers were overwhelmed too in my opinion they made the mistake to add even more mysteries and in a higher pace in season then to solve the ones or partially at least the ones of season at the end of season you ended with a big blurr of secrets plot twists and unexplained phenomena but there is only so much a viewer can take the difference between season and however was huge season handed out a lot of insights to partially replace them with new questions and that s exactly how they should write you want to thumble from one plot twist to the next not get a tsunami of secrets spread all over you and then pick up a few to explain to the viewers they got that in season and brings us a promising series future for season its good to see that such a different format of a series can be so hugely popular
i had the pleasure of viewing this beautiful film last night with the wonderful addition of a question and answer session with the director following the viewing i suspect that the first commenter has never lost a parent or someone very close to them in death i have had many such losses and this movie spoke to me one of the major themes is how we don t deal with questions issues stories with our loved ones until it s too late they re too incapacitated or dead before that happens talk to your loved ones listen to and record their stories tell people you love them resolve differences i loved the message that there are no mistakes i love the director s portrayal of the relationship of the two daughters as one of six siblings it s clear to me he understood how complex those relationships are his history as a cinematographer also comes through loud and clear what a beautiful movie the casting is outstanding a film not to be missed
this begins a wager between edgar allen poe and a journalist poe bets that the man can not spend an entire night in a creepy castle well of course he can but will he come out unscathed hard to say with all these strange people that aren t supposed to be there wandering around including the icy barbara steele this is a fairly odd film in that the presentation is both in french and english and switches back and forth a few times perhaps this is done because bits of dialog were lost it s also rather dark and claustrophobic being that one doesn t see much beyond a small circle of light that candles and such generate plus there s a feel of dread and impending doom pretty much at all times this version on synapse is also uncensored and i wondered what might be censored in a film from until i saw the topless scene i guess that might be it overall this is pretty good and in gloomy black and white barbara steele definitely makes the movie too out of
page is most definitely a very enthralling and captivating eye opener that very cleverly exposes the hypocrite lifestyles of mumbai s elite from the fake kisses to the plastered smiles page leaves no stone unturned in revealing the shocking lives of the rich and the famous backstabbing gossip corruption and scandal lurk in every dark corner in the world of glitz and glam humanity and generosity are analogous to an oasis in the desert in this world where social darwinism is the prevailing mentality everyone is constantly craving for more money more fame and a higher reputation driving them to do the most shameful things imaginable ranging from signing film contracts at a funeral to child molestation anything is possible in this metropolis where there is a such a wide gap between the social classes the audience sees the ugliness of both of these classes through the eyes of the protagonist she observes the suffocating atmosphere and the mind boggling frenzy that the socialites live in bollywood business tycoons politicians and the underworld are all intertwined in a completely convoluted mess kitne ajeeb hai is a nice track as is the peppy kuan main doob jaongi terrific film with excellent character development
the first time i saw this film i loved it it was different i am a christian bible believing i don t go along with the crowd of right wing believers i dropped out of that atmosphere to me in their attempts to take over our government they are doing what judas tried to do i call it the judas syndrome judas didn t get it even though jesus said his kingdom was not of this world this film certainly showed some of that i also liked that jesus enjoyed the simple pleasure of playing games and jokes with his disciples also he was a very gorgeous jesus it s a watch over and over movie very satisfying
a very good wartime movie showing the effects of war on a hometown boy who looses his eyesight on guadalcanal and must come home and re adjust himself with the help of family and friends an excellent cast of actor s helps make this movie very entertaining eleanor parker s role as the girlfriend was worthy of an oscar nomination she has such an innocence to her in this movie ann doran role was equally satisfying as was all of her small supporting roles i especially like the hometown aura of pre war phildelphia the hunting scene is very good of course the war scene on guadalcanal truly showed the horror faced by our soldiers during this epic battle a well deserving film and one that should not be forgotten

the arch title doesn t fit this gentle romantic comedy donna reed and tom drake don t have much chemistry but their characters aren t supposed to both are extremely likable and attractive the supporting cast is a dream with the exception of sig ruman s annoying faux russian
the movie was very sweet and heartwarming i cry almost every time i watch the movie i would recommend this movie for every one the movie was so inspiring to me the actors did a great job of acting and the movie was very well played and done the movie was about a little girl who owned a parrot of whom she named paulie paulie had gotten separated from her by her parents because they thought it would be best for her after paulie had experienced so many people he ended up in a cage by himself in a basement finally this russian man who had gotten a job at a place as a janitor had found paulie in the basement and paulie began to talk to him telling him the story of his life in the end the man helped paulie reunite with marie the little girl who raised paulie love overcame all the obstacles
this is an entertaining movie actually might make you uncomfortable since it isn t some undead psychopath or sociopath its your everyday doctor how scary is that got some good actors and actresses in this movie though some where unappreciated like virginya keehne as sarah ken foree who you might recognize from rob zombie s devils rejects and halloween co stars as our detective on schizoid dr alan feinstone s corbin benson trail short little summary is this dr alan feinstone a guy who has a sexy wife nice house and is a great dentist everyone loves until he catches his wife cheating on him with the pool cleaner then he starts having hallucinations that his patients teeth are all rotted and that the female patients are his wife as he starts going nuts in this thriller but before that nice guy
antwone fisher s story of childhood neglect and abuse is an inspiration to all among us who witnessed or even experienced the plight of foster children abandoned by a troubled mother antwone has never met his father growing up with church going abusers who use the n word not only to intimidate and hurt but also as a term of endearment as a young man witnessing how his best friend is killed in a hold up enduring racial slurs and being teased while serving in the navy antwone s anger is slowly turned into positive power when counseled by a navy psychiatrist and a love enters his life the scene where antwone meets his birth mother is one of the most powerful moments in the film stunned by the unexpected confrontation the woman listens in silence to hear the young man tell her how he has lived a life without crime addictions to drugs fathering children left and right all despite his utterly adverse circumstances if that scene wasn t powerful enough the very next one drives it home and opens the flood gates a reception to welcome home antwone dozens of smiling faces and open arms announcing that he is part of this great family one of the messages delivered by this wonderful film is that there are many well meaning and sincere people working to help orphans and unwanted children even if some of the homes and administrators don t seem to care and appear self serving many do give it their all the character who found antwone s file once he disclosed the circumstances of his birth is one of those bright lights in the darkness of the system the dvd includes a french language track various subtitle choices as well as additional features and information about foster parenting as a clevelander i appreciated the location footage no matter where you are from you will be deeply moved by this autobiographical gem

yet again madhur bhandarkar takes you on a ride to the wild side and a remarkable one it is literally and figuratively mumbai hi society stars and starlets glam dolls and witch doctors business tycoons and broker types yep the whole stinking lot are in sharp focus here in typical tabloid fashion their worlds unfold with every colorful story a clever sub plot in itself a struggling starlet dumped by the producer after getting her pregnant the stewardess and her high profile husband the pedophile businessman and his neurotic wife the reporters and the police captain all shades on display and countless hues in between bhandarkar does a swell job of digging up the dirt on the drama kings the dancing queens and the living dead atul kulkarni packs a punch as does boman irani and sandhya mrudul konkona sen sharma is effective as the ex crime beat reporter but she could have been dolled up a little in keeping with the job change and the party circuit highly focused running time min and refreshingly different film well worth the money
stunning absolutely stunning this is a movie about two kids who s father suddenly has a vision he claims an angel visits him and tells him that they need to kill demons he gets instructions later and they start rounding up the demons which are to the naked eye ordinary people they kill these so called demons with an ax to the head and chop them up burying them in the rose garden their father claims he can see their sins when he touches them the movie continues with a twist at the end the thing that i love about this movie is that it perfectly captures the frailty of human perception is their father completely mad or is he telling the truth the audience is left to decide go make the judgment for yourself and see the movie now
i did not have too much interest in watching the flock andrew lau co directed the masterpiece trilogy of infernal affairs but he had been fired from the flock and he had been replaced by an emergency director called niels mueller i had the feeling that lau had made a good film but it had not satisfied the study so they fired him and hired another director this usually does not work well let s remember the invasion but the flock resulted to be better than what i expected it s not a great film but it s an interesting and entertaining thriller the character development is very well done and i could know the characters very well also the relationship between the two main characters is natural and credible richard gere and claire danes bring competent performances now let s go to the negative points one element which really bothered me there was a moment in which it irritated me was the excess of edition tricks to give the movie more attitude and style that tricks feel out of place and their presence is arbitrary plus i think the film should have been more ambitious in spite of that i recommend the flock as a good thriller it s not memorable at all but it s entertaining
bear in mind any film let alone documentary which asserts any kind of truth will generate an adverse and proportional amount of cynicism from those to whom any suggestion of and or search for truths is already meaningless those of you who are already masters of psychology film and captains of the soul will no doubt find this movie redundant after all you already know everything there is to know congrats for those of us in the minority like myself i found the perverts guide to cinmea mostly brilliant and worth watching for those interested in movies psychology and modern philosophy a little like scott mclouds understanding comics director sophie fiennes inter grates slovene philosopher psychologist and social critic slavoj zizek right into many of the films and specif scenes he discusses the cover is an image from the birds zizek takes a boat out to re create the shot lacanian psycho analysis does not necessarily scream an evening of great fun but it is if you like movies that is having some knowledge of lacanian psycho analysis helps symbolic real and imaginary are terms which get thrown around a little loosely at first but the scenes which zizek selects and analyze make remarkably clear what was always for me a very abstract subject in fact it s probably better to have a familiarity with the films he s discussing than with the terminology he uses which becomes clearer as the film goes on why i love this film isn t because it picks great films to analyze or reveals great truths about lacan but shows in a very practical and clever manner where film and psychology and by default philosophy meet why is the sound of music kinda fascistic why is short cuts about more than just class and alienation why do the birds attack in the birds what is there to learn about the mind from alien resurrection what does the planet of solaris want what does psycho and the marx brothers have to do with each other and what the hell is david lynch getting across in movie after movie well zizek has some ideas the role of the voice in both the excorcist and star wars revenge of the sith is maybe the movies strongest and most lucid moment when he gets into feminine sexual subjectivity i begin to wonder at one point zizek admits his feeling that flowers are a kind of decorative vagina dentatta that they are disgusting and should be hidden from children jokingly it seems but anyway it s a fascinating documentary which anyone who has ever seen a movie and thought it meant something more than was literally stated should make an attempt to see and anyone interested in slavoj zizek this is a must as well much less dry than reality of the virtual and more direct than zizek two other pseudo docs about the elvis of contemporary cultural criticism as he is being dubbed in the english speaking world the perverts guide to cinema is not about the role of sex in cinema zizek claims cinema is the ultimate pervert art because it teaches how to desire and not what to desire and that it is the only contemporary art form that can allow for these desires to be articulated this is not a film about finding the reality in cinema it s about finding the cinema in reality and how important and exciting that can be hard to find and a bit long but well worth the trouble one of the most stimulating movie watching experiences i ve ever had
as long as you go into this movie knowing that it s terrible bad acting bad effects bad story bad everything then you ll love it this is one of my favorite goof on movies watch it as a comedy and have a dozen good laughs
after garbo s introduction to sound in clarence brown s anna christie jacques feyder made a german version of the movie where all of the cast except for garbo were different while the american version is still more available in the usa and most of the american viewers have primarily seen this version the germna anna christie is more likely to be viewed in europe as i have seen both films i feel the right to compare the two closely knit productions is jacques feyder s film different is it better than clarence brown s in this analysis i would like to focus first on what the both movies have in common they have identical sets very similar scripts and the same chronologically presented scenes here you also find the story of the young woman who comes back to her father after years of absence and is trying to start a new life here you also have the humorous though a bit shorter sequence in the amusement park however when emphasizing garbo herself i address the first difference she does not appear to cause such a curiosity while talking the viewer concentrates more on her acting than on the way she speaks which occurred most probably to viewers garbo was very good in american film and she is also very good here yet to me she seems even more genuine in the german version it is noticeable that garbo does not focus on the way she says the words that much the effort that was artificially created by the sensation garbo talks her german is not very well pronounced yet no one cares everything is perfectly understood therefore i can easily say the same i did in my american version comment skaal greta garbo yet the film differs in one very important issue the rest of the cast here comes the question which portrayal seems more captivating which one is better for sure the differences are filled with varieties salka viertel or salka steuerman garbo s lifelong friend does not do the equally great job as marie dressler in the role of marthy owens she is not bad she is different sometimes overacts from today s perspective but is no longer that genuine in the role as marie dressler who still amuses us and whose moments have absolutely stood a test of time some people even claim that dressler was better than garbo in the film and that opinion though appears to be questionable of course carries some truth theo shall is more sympathetic as matt than charles bickford but when applied to him this is not the matter of performance so much as the mater of looks who shines in the german anna christie who is really worth greatest attention is hans junkermann in the role of chris christopherson anna s father george f marion vs hans junkermann is like a day vs night difference junkermann portrays a real alcohol addict a man with hopes with fears who overdoes the care of his daughter the scene of anna s first meeting with her father is truly magnificent the opening moment of chris conversation with marthy is memorable particularly thanks to his facial expressions and a flawless performance junkermann is the chris whom you like who you sometimes laugh at whom you sympathize with who leaves a picture of a calm alcoholic sailor in your mind great if you have seen the american anna christie and have a chance to get the german version i would highly recommend to you this movie because it s a slightly different look at the story a nice and accurate way to compare a fine enrichment to clarence brown s movie and foremost a wonderful chance to discover a marvel of performance hans junkermann s skaal or prost hans junkermann
i chose to see the this film on the day it opened nationally in france as a personal way for myself to reflect on what had happened a year previous the collection works as intended it provokes a whirlwind of thoughts and emotions working as an intellectual hommage never stooping to cheap sentimentality nor knee jerk reactionism there have been many allegations made that the film is anti american while i cannot speak for everyone in this regard i am one american who found such statements to be completely untrue people make much noise about the egyptian segment by chahine because it voices perspectives of palestinian suicide bombers asserting that civilians in a democracy are fair targets for they elect the governments the bombers are seeking to attack but this ignores much else in the piece several perspectives are discussed no one being held up as the truth and critics if they even saw the piece seem to forget the fondness and warm dialogue that takes place between the director and the ghost of the american dialogue and the director s intense sadness upon hearing of the tragedy pretty much all of the films are beautiful thoughtful inspiring in particular the brilliant work by mahkmalbaf tanovic loach inarritu nair good as usual effectively tells a true story of an injustice committed against a muslim family in the wake of anti islam hysteria that swept and still sweeps the states i did find gitai s piece a bit vulgarly loud and simple in it s critic of media hysteria in the face of terrorism and penn s piece was too impressionistic and elliptical for my tastes though i had expected to like it borgnine is very good and brave in it spoiler warning one reviewer below incorrectly read the falling of the towers as being a happy moment for the character my read is rather that the falling of the towers is what because light floods his room keys him into the loss in his life that he refused to recognize again this is a sort of impressionistic piece for we know that if the towers were really blocking the light to this man s flat then there would have been nothing but smoke and ash not light flooding through his window
so many educational films are nothing more than mind numbing drudgery saved only by the fact that mst k mocks them why study industrial arts comes to mind hemo the magnificent is actually quite well done it s all about blood the heart and the circulatory system i admit that i don t remember everything from it but it does a good job explaining everything keeping it serious but entertaining i guess that you can always count on june foray most famously the voice of rocky the squirrel she plays a deer here since hemo the magnificent itself may be hard to find probably the best place to see it is in gremlins a class is watching it while a gremlin is forming
first of all i liked very much the central idea of locating the intruders others in the fragile self on various levels mainly subconscious but sometimes more allegorical in fact the intruders are omnipresent throughout the film in the swiss french border where the pretagonist leads secluded life in the his recurring daydream and nightmare inside his ailing body after heart transplantation in the last half of the film he becomes intruder himself returning in ancient french colony in the hope of atoning for the past the overall tone is bitter rather than pathetic full of regrets and guilts sense of failure being more or less dominant this is a quite grim picture of an old age ostensibly self dependent but hopelessly void and lonely inside the directer composes the images more to convey passing sensations of anxiety and desire than any explicit meanings some of them are mesmerizing not devoid of humor though kind of absurdist play only somnambulist can visualize
this was the most costly film when produced sir alexander korda and h g wells were both distressed by its poor ratings for good reason it was and remains far ahead of its time aside from the seemingly poor direction probably editing at the very beginning the work moves along to a stunning conclusion whether its sir ralph richardson s boss role or even better his wife s sir cedric s as adversary to space faring raymond massey s john cabal center role all deliver mind boggling performances the scene with mr korda s incomparable set of the small girl child running out to an absolutely never to be matched scene commenting life just keeps getting lovelier and lovelier that swiftly brings tears to any parent grandparent this is not a film for the young unless experienced and rather those who have seen the horror it opposes sure the phony parachuting looks hokey while using a magnetic cannon now termed mass driver may be viewed as ridiculous vs rockets give sir korda a break mr wells made that choice and at million this film went way beyond over budget so he concentrated on what he could manage the true power of this greatest of cinema rests in john cabal s final statement of human destiny his friend passworthy doubts the wisdom of space faring saying we re such little animals john cabal s proper response is paraphrased yes little animals and if that is all we are we must live and die as such they are standing under a large astronomical telescope he sweeps his hand over the night sky yet we may have all the universe or nothing then the final chorus breaks in which shall it be this is not star wars blade runner anything you may consider great this is the real thing i remind all of steven hawking s most recent address upon his latest medal of honor humanity must leave earth or die the very core of this work i love standard entertainment yet this relic for the wise viewer offers far more which shall it be be in the proper mood whatever that takes this will take your breath away i guarontee overall for humanity the most significant of cinema since posting i note many have commented on the poor media quality of surviving examples in the s i developed a proprietary colorization process which required a clean original this led me to michael korda who sadly noted all were gone so we must relish what remains sad but true
maybe it s because i saw the movie before reading the book but i really love this movie i ve seen it many many times and will be watching it many times more it s a compelling story that s interesting from the beginning to the end it has everything action romance etc
most of the comments have been positive but i would like to add that viewers should also focus on the sets the set designer used a lot of beautiful art deco treatments along with beautiful buildings stairs doors furniture and so forth it is worth paying attention to the movie is driven by characterization and symbolism which is very rich all the gangster actors were cast it was like seeing old friends and it was a treat the dialog was amusing at times but stilted at times and i suppose it was meant to be that way this is a film buff s film it was made by people for people who love the medium don t miss this one
if you have ever read and enjoyed a novel by tom robbins you will appreciate this movie as a whole hearted attempt to translate his outrageously unconventional writing style into a workable piece of big screen art the actors and the direction of this film are both good the only trouble with the film as i can see it is that robbins can relate ideas and sentiments with his words that were still beyond hollywood s capabilities at the time this film was shot given both the irreverence of today s movies as well as the willingness and abilityof today s audiences to delve into the bizarre i think even cowgirls would receive a better reception today than it did when it was originally released
i saw this film last night at a special movie theater showing in n rnberg and it was superb i do have to admit that the original music composition of the cello player and percussion xylophone player influenced the mood of the film but the film itself also had force in its portrayal of the tragic nibelungen saga if you are interested in silent films or in the nibelungenlied i highly recommend this film the costumes were fantastic and creative the sets were opulent and exotic and the acting was dramatic and breathtaking as is typical of silent film tragedies unfortunately i have not seen the first part of this film duo that concerns siegfried the story of this second film begins after siegfried s death when kremhild gudrun in the norse versions of the story begins to plan her revenge against her brothers also i watched this film in german i am a native english speaker and have a basic german knowledge it was difficult to read the subtitles what do you call that in silent films at first because of the old style german script so i advise that if you watch it in german that you make sure you can differentiate your k s f s and s s in the old script
i liked this movie it was pretty cool it has it all cars gun shooting fighting and even a token girl it does not excel in any of this things with the exception of the cars a bit of shooting a bit of fighting a bit of smooching around and lot s of car with a great chase near the end the jump you may say is impractical but according to our good friends here at the imdb it is possible so the movie ain t as bad as people are painting it it has some quality and i liked to watch it in fact i loved the film and i didn t need to turn off my brains to watch it i wasn t always thinking is this possible or tramp like that in
i know that originally this film was not a box office hit but in light of recent hollywood releases most of which have been decidedly formula ridden plot less pointless save the blonde chick no matter what drivel feast of all saints certainly in this sorry context deserves a second opinion the film like the book loses anchoring in some of the historical background but it depicts a uniquely american dilemma set against the uniquely horrific american institution of human enslavement and some of its tragic and funny and touching consequences and worthy of singling out is the youthful robert ri chard cast as the leading figure marcel whose idealistic enthusiasm is truly universal as he sets out in the beginning of his coming of age only to be cruelly disappointed at what turns out to become his true education in the ways of the southern plantation world of louisiana at the apex of the antebellum period when i saw the previews featuring the dreaded blond haired ri chard i expected a buffoon a fop a caricature i was pleasantly surprised ossie davis ruby dee the late ben vereen pam grier victoria rowell and even jasmine guy lend vivid imagery and formidable skill as actors in the backdrop tapestry of placage voodoo creole aristocracy and haitian revolt woven into this tale of human passion hate love family and racial perplexity in a society which is supposedly gone and yet somehow is still with us
telemundo should definitely consider making a dvd collection of the novela xica i know tons of people including myself who would like to be able to purchase the novela xica it is a very entertaining novela which is set in brazil the costumes worn by the actors are beautiful and the town in which the novela takes place is beautiful xica contains a lot of history of that time period i wish telemundo would televise it again even if it was a in the morning i would highly recommend watching xica if it is ever shown again on telemundo i ve e mailed telemundo a million times already to show the novela again but my pleas have fallen on deaf ears the only cautionary statement about xica is that it occasionally contains some harsh scenes therefore i would recommend that children under do not watch xica overall xica merits a out of
if you think weird al yankovic is hilarious you won t be disappointed by the compleat al not only does this rare mockumentary feature many of yankovic s more memorable videos like a surgeon and i love rocky road among them but they are inter spliced with funny vignettes supposedly highlighting the parodist s rise to fame yankovic is not for all tastes but his humor is harmless and imaginative enough that even non fans will at least be lightly amused die hard fans will love it not only for its content but also for its relatively early look into yankovic s now nearly three decade career suitable for all ages kiddies will no doubt love the funny visuals
enterprise the latest high budget spin off to the most successful franchise in film and or television history opens to the tune of a minute episode called broken bow first we are swept into a massive action sequence with a klingon being chased by some suliban who are the main enemy in the first season of the show from there the televised movie takes us on a journey that seldom gets as good as it is with some of the best character development story and action visual effects ever seen in such a short amount of time the opening credits is a debatable subject among the minority of enterprise fans whom some believe that the song is out of place what they fail to realise is the lyrics themselves if one listens to the actual song instead of the theme then they will begin to piece the parts of the puzzle together and eventually as the series progresses further and further and we learn more about our valiant captain and his crew will the song actually become meaningful overall diane warren s theme is beautifully orchestrated and is sung just as well by opera singer russell watson what makes any television show watchable and worth watching time and time again is its characters and the way they become structured and layered enterprise is in my opinion one of the most well cast shows since the next generation choosing scott bakula as captain jonathan archer was the best decision since gene himself cast patrick stewart as jean luc picard as the captain always leads the show bakula adds a subtlety to his role and brings a huge smile to the faces of anyone with blood pumping in their veins he simply is both actor wise and character wise a superb human being and his charm wit and compassion are overwhelming to watch as for the other cast members a favourite of mine is john billingsley who plays dr phlox it s also nice to see a non human playing a role and the decision to give the captain a dog named porthos was a well received idea throughout the show character development was brilliant it was fast well timed and almost perfect i say almost because sadly travis mayweather s character played by the briton anthony montgomery is a little weak at the end of the first season he does have some things to say here and there but remains in the hands of the producers to make him more important jolene blalock is wonderful as the sometimes harsh but equally loveable subcommander t pol dominic keating as lieutenant malcolm reed plays a strong role and is convincing as the armoury officer connor trinneer plays commander charles trip tucker who always adds charm and comedic style to his character and finally linda park as ensign hoshi sato who often plays a weaker character but thankfully quickly becomes interesting all of these characters make up enterprise and all bring a quality that star trek hasn t seen in a long time each person makes this show worth watching smiles and feel good senses are guaranteed right from the first time we see them all together on the bridge of the starship enterprise nx the ship itself the nx is somewhat questionable in design the series is set years from now and years before captain kirk so why then does the ship appear to be similar in design to mid th century ships namely the akira class starship continuity has been an issue in enterprise but thankfully rick berman and brannon braga offer suitable explanations for each and everyone of them continuity is only a problem if you are forever scrutinising shows and are obsessed with the tiniest of details if you see the show with and open mind then you ll have no problems but there is an urge to know why all the time so what did berman and braga offer to the star trek fan base with the issue of the deign of the ship itself according to them the nx is how it is because of the incident in first contact when zefram cochrane saw the enterprise e through his telescope and from speaking with the away team lead by commander riker it changed the ideas in his head that s a good enough explanation for me lets move on of course its not as easy for some fans to accept that sort of answer some go as far as to refuse to see the show until they get a reasonable answer come on guys grow up when george lucas destroyed the star wars saga with the launch of his profit making new trilogy fans couldn t do anything only watch and sap it all up anyway and then they learned that well maybe its not that bad after all if you can t accept a quality show for what it is not what it should be in your mind then go elsewhere or try becoming a producer on the show and then see what you can do the sets on enterprise remind me very much of the defiant from deep space nine they often appear cold and have an eerie look of modern structure to them and they cry out that they belong to the military perhaps that why the crew of the uss enterprise aka flagship of the american fleet like it so much they are striking sets and represent the show perfectly rick berman the overlord of the empire as john logan so accurately put it and his counterpart brannon braga has hit the nail on the head exactly where they should have and in all the right places whether that be technicalities visuals sound editing or score enterprise is a fine demonstration to just how good televised science fiction can ultimately be when in the hands of geniuses the late gene roddenberry would be proud of this series and as a star trek fan so should you
i enjoyed this movie so much that i watched it twice and that is something to say about a documentary the musical score cinematography and sound are absolutely stunning as you might expect from an imax production even though it is shot for those huge imax theaters it looks and sounds wonderful on my home system in fact this would make a perfect dvd to demo your system the subject is also so fascinating it is about mario andretti and his son michael i was already a fan of mario because he is the best racecar drive in history since he is the only person to win the cart championship f championship the daytona and the indianapolis the script follows the path of two cars very important to the father and son the first car is found in a chicken coop and turns out to be the first roadster that mario ever drove and we follow restoration to gleaming perfection the other car is michael s new racecar and we follow it from cutting the mold through the race season imax lends just the right magic to make car construction entertaining and fascinating paul newman who was michael amoretti s team owner at the time this movie was made narrates the film his anecdotes and witticism drawn from many years as an owner and driver lends much to the production the main feature is the race scenes turn up the volume here there is something about riding along at over mph and the musical score that totally draws you into the screen for an experience you will not forget wow the final magical element is the humanity of the andretti family this god of the racing world mario andretti is loving father who proudly watches over his son s career they work together so well that every father and son should see this you can tell that they are a close family i wish we could all have that experience
a much undervalued film that tells the story of a young musician caught in an ever declining spiral of domestic violence at times difficult to watch while morris day is portrayed as the misogynist prince as the knight on motorcycle steed he is still called upon to twice beat a woman as part of the screenplay that he can do this and still emerge as a flawed but vindicated hero is credit to the writing prince is so free of ego in this film that not only does he portray himself as a narcissistic megalomaniac who beats women but his most famous song is fictionalised as being written by his father and wendy lisa even further two of his compositions computer blue admittedly the album s weakest track and darling nikki are shown as being songs that kill off an audience perhaps the only concession to the princely ego is a card that lists the slightly shorter than prince apollonia as the nearly complete amateur cast are mainly band members playing themselves and reviewers who slate the actors on the terms that they ve never appeared in other movies are completely missing the point and do perfectly well under the direction morris day gets most of the plaudits for his likable ham though jerome benton must also get credit for bouncing off him well particularly their stage act which is hilarious day and benton even go so far as to make an abbott and costello routine funny which takes some doing lastly there s prince while i admit to bias i do actually think he s a pretty good actor in terms of being able to portray a low key version of himself acting isn t his profession this was a film made for entertainment so anyone pointing out that the guy in the lead role isn t robert deniro and thinking they re making a point is sadly deluded i don t want this review to be a derisory attack of other people s comments but i ve even this film slated as having a low budget and being darkly lit how would a film about domestic violence be shot then with full overhead spotlights and a cgi dinosaur walking into frame the film acts almost as a perfect snapshot of the neon light and skinny tie era until you remember that it was actually made in a world of curly perms and tinny synths and this isn t some retro recreation prince s best film with oscar winning music it sees him at his zenith and it s saddening to realise that even though he would make some fine albums he would never again capture this high
star trek hidden frontier is a long running internet only fan film done completely for the love of the series and a must watch for fans of trek the production quality is extremely high for a fan film although sometimes you can tell that they re green screenin it this doesn t take away from the overall experience however the cgi ships are fantastic as well as the space battle scenes on the negative side i could tell in the earlier episodes and even occasionally in the newer ones that some of the actors actresses are not quite comfortable in their roles but once again this doesn t take away from the overall experience of new interpretations of star trek the cast and crew have truly come up with something special here and as a whole i would highly recommend this series to fans of the next generation and deep space
i have to say that grand canyon is one of the most affecting films i ve ever seen i ve watched it several times now and i still feel as i did the first time that this film by itself could make up the entire curriculum of a post graduate course in film direction a long time ago film trailers used to promise it ll make you laugh it ll make you cry that s a very trite and shorthand method of describing what grand canyon does it takes you to the best places in human experience and the next moment takes you to the gates of hell much of the film is paced to cycle back and forth between people being close to happiness and the same people being close to horror it s always a short step too just to manage that swing with grace and without making it look false or exaggerated is directorial genius spoiler of sorts coming up after getting the audience used to rocking back and forth through the emotional spectrum the film throws a curve with a sequence that doesn t go from good to bad and back but instead escalates from an ordinary marital spat through an accidental self inflicted knife wound that may or may not require stitches to an earthquake that has the characters run from the house in the moment of their relief argument forgotten cut finger forgotten the earthquake survived a neighbor woman calls out that her elderly husband has collapsed the couple rushes to his aid i cried when i saw this sequence i cried every time i saw it i m crying now it isn t sadness that does this to me it s not a particularly sad sequence what tears me up is that this few minutes of film was perfect that s perfect astounding end of spoiler there s so much to say about grand canyon it portrays relatively ordinary people experiencing epiphanies and it lets the viewer experience them vicariously they aren t showy or overblown and there s no long pause to examine the moment carefully the film moves on at the pace of life even when the characters do try to make sense of what has happened they are uncertain of what to derive from their experience grand canyon is a very human film
this is a very amusing and sometimes quite creepy anthology that if a bit short in the screenwriting department more than makes up for the shortcoming in the acting location work and overall exuberance the best episodes of this are the first with denholm elliot playing a horror writer stalked by a character from his novel in the works a perfect example of the acting pulling this out of the merely pedestrian the third with christopher lee as a man terrified of his own daughter and the final episode with the late great jon pertwee as a pompous horror film star who gets more than just a new role on his latest project the dialogue between pertwee and ingrid pitt is sparkling and inspired both obviously relishing the opportunity to really ham it up cushing is typically good in the weakest segment which certainly isn t helped by the fact that the wax figure of the woman he s obsessed with down at the local wax museum is anything but beautiful as we are told to believe she is someone of shocking beauty was needed and instead we re given a woman with a jaw of a turtle minor quibbles aside this movie and it s wonderful country house setting is one to catch when you can
for this film i m a british india doctor currently in india the word beckham put me off cos i m a die hard liverpool fan and personally think that owen is really cool since liverpool and man utd are rivals i was dead sure that i wouldn t watch the film but then i was in delhi to meet some friends and i had an early morning flight so i thought what the heck let s bide time by watching this film cos it was a late night show what a moron i was i should ve seen this film the day it was released i guess using beckham s name was to draw audience attraction which had back fired in my case but then i really can t think of a better title for the film and nagra knightley drop dead gorgeous and rhys myers did a superb job if you hate football dislike manchester united or england for that matter then this is definately the film for you in fact i m just yrs old a psychiatrist by profession but a kid at heart this film has knocked star wars off my no position surprisingly there aren t very many comments on this film by indian brits like me i wonder why for this film
great woody allen no good woody allen definitely i found myself along with the audience in attendance laughing hard and often at some of the best woody allen lines we ve heard in a while the aging allen created an appropriate role for himself as scarlett johansson s father well sort of some have said johansson plays a young dianne keaton i beg to differ she plays woody s dialogue which in his comedies always has a very similar feel like well a woody allen comedy that s fine for us woody appreciators she certainly did woody s dialogue far better than the young cast of his last comedy melinda melinda some may find woody s humor tiresome but for those of us who love it when it s done right we look forward to the next
it is a pleasure to see such creativity on tv again this show is poetic artistic and good fun the characters relate well and the writing is not bad i think it will improve as they get their legs definitely worth a look the girls steal the show so far in this series chuck is adorable as is olive the two aunts are a delight i sincerely hope they write them into bigger parts as they are magic well that s all the news that is fit to print go make yourself a big bowl of popcorn and enjoy something fun in an old fashioned way this is like dr seuss for adults
i really enjoyed watching this movie about the delany sisters i knew of them but that was all this movie opened my eyes to their bravado and courage what a pair what sacrifices they made to live life on their own terms this is not only a movie for african americans but for all americans it is sort of a history lesson and a documentary rolled into one and combined with an entertaining movie biography the acting was superior by all included and we really do get a glimpse of the hardships these two sisters went through for many years both sisters are quite different from each other they came from a very loving and very strict family with high maybe even impossible standards of perfection it is sad to see how sadie s father refused to allow his daughter to continue to see her boyfriend due to a possible misunderstanding i thoroughly recommend this movie and i am glad i caught it on television the other day
when i first started watching these it became one of my favourite shows melissa joan hart is very funny and talented so were the aunts and the other characters and the star of of the show salem the cat he was immensely funny the first few season in my opinion were the best where sabrina was a teenager in high school adapting to witch life they were most funniest most entertaining and most um good i m not a fan of when they started introducing brad and dreamer cause i quite liked valerie but they were okay the problem was they were only in it for one season if you re gonna have new people at least keep them i didn t like josh he was a tw t i preferred harvey but then he disappeared and they got rid of libby it would have been awesome if thy had been bickering in theses seven years and mr craft as well if him and zelda got married that would have been gold then sabrina moves out of her aunts house and into roxie miles morgan s house i didn t like theses people either it didn t really seem they liked sabrina sabrina seemed to lose her charm and stuff and the aunts seem to be shunned out of her life and into they re own stupid story lines i kind of stopped watching it for a while and the old re runs were back and i was like whoo hoo lol i must say the last few seasons were absolutely terrible they got rid of the aunts which sucked cause they were a big part of the show then suddenly she lets those two freeloaders move in to the nice house when they treated he like dirt and now she s working at some magazine shop so they re putting loads celebrity guest stars into the show if they re in every episode it kind of ruins it the programme just really went downhill and lost its luster i saw the last episode it had the aunts in it zelda was reduced to a candle and she s about to get married but she runs off with harvey the end i would have liked to know what happened after well thats my review and the only thing i can say is the only thing that stayed it s appealing self through the seven years was salem the cat
the movie gets to the guts of the tension between a son and a father the brilliant dialog lovely scenery and great acting serve as an excellent way to present the onion that keeps peeling back layers the core issues of parenting communication and manhood are explored indirectly in fun ways the curtain is pulled back the masks slip off a little and truths are exposed all of this happens amidst a road trip format the backdrop is rural new york state in the early fall just as the trees are changing colors wow
billy wilder is co credited for the story and his unsentimental touch is noticeable in this quite original tale of ghostwriting songwriters who both work for burnt out music legend oliver courtney the obvious misunderstandings are gotten out of the way quite quickly thank heaven and what remains is a witty and breezy concoction with some fine songs and some more forgettable ones crosby at his most charming a great turn by broadway legend mary martin and basil rathbone and oscar levant providing most of the cynical barbs levant is in rare form and his quips haven t dated at all a delightful surprise and recommended for all fans of the genre
this was a very good movie and is absolutely unfair to judge it without taking into account the time when it was released there are some movies which do not get older but this is clearly out of date however i saw this film when i was a boy and for more than twenty years both the images as the story were unforgettable for me and most of my friends until we could appreciate it again on dvd actually i do remember this movie as the topic of several chats and meetings where old boys were talking about things we have in common therefore there was a little feeling of disappoint and even sadness when we finally had the dvd firstly there was a theory about how naives our generation was secondly i think there is something more i would asset that this movie has something which should be interesting for all the modern film makers specifically those who focus on the decaying horror genre this is the mutilation the idea which gives coherence to the film the fact of a human being mutilated produces a deeper horror than death and torture i remember how sick the sensation was when the monster rip kurt s arm out and at the end when the creature bites the doctor s neck to take a piece of his veins another remarkable thing is the morbid atmosphere which prevails without decaying in intensity through all the scenes no matter if the action is on a secret lab a lonely street where the man in a car is looking for a female body a striper dressing room and so on may be the reasons why it is not longer a good movie are just technical things for example in the scene of the accident and the man saving his fianc e s head a more accurate work made for another and modern second unit director could be interesting same thing with all action scenes including the one of kurt s arm furthermore something could be done with the monster s make up some remakes have been good i think in this case an attempt would worth while nevertheless the black and white tones should be conserved
have you ever in your life gone out for a sport s activity tried your best and then found yourself in an important segment of it where for a brief moment you were given a chance to be a hero and a champion and failed i believe many of us have had that moment in our lives this is the premise of the movie the best of times in this story a middle age banker named jack dundee robin williams suffers from the deep melancholy of a football mistake which happened years ago is inspired to re play the game again in order to accomplish this he must convince the once great football quarterback reno hightower kurt russell to make a comeback for reno who is satisfied with his present lot in life see s no need to change the past record which get s better as he ages added to both their problem is the fact years have passed and in addition both their marriages are floundering and in need of re vamping not easy when his father in law donald moffat habitually reminds him of the biggest drop nevertheless dundee is persistent and will do anything to try and correct the greatest blunder of his life great fun for anyone wishing to enjoy their youth again
seven pounds stars will smith as ben thomas an irs collection agent who has an ulterior motive for meeting those who have gotten behind on their tax payments thomas caused the deaths of seven people whilst driving talking on his phone and the movie follows his attempt to try and atone for his quite frankly unforgivable crime the story line is as subtle as a brick through a green house window what you see is exactly what is happening even the ending of titanic was more surprising when compared to seven pounds there is absolutely no twist whatsoever there is never any confusion or doubt as to what is happening normally i only like will smith when is in full bad boys mode the guy is at his best when sporting a gun driving a ford gt and saying aw hell nah as whenever he tries to act serious it only comes across as a pathetic attempt at trying to gain an oscar which he is so obviously is desperate for this is probably the main reason why i wasn t looking forward to the movie although here he is very understated there are flashes of comedy but they are subtle in fact it was the most understated will smith performance i have ever seen and for that reason alone he was fantastic and ironically should be nominated for a major award the supporting cast were all grand too rosario dawson looked pretty much at deaths door the whole film and woody harrelson and barry pepper were fine as where all the other bit players overall it is a weepy but it isn t throwing all the usual clich s and sentimental violins to give you no other choice but to cry there were a few times that even my hardened heart nearly broke you will be hard pressed not to find one of the situations that does not relate to your own life which makes it seem all the more real i would give it the will smith show moves onto drama without all the desperation of the pursuit of happiness and comes of all the better for it
being a huge fan of the japanese singers gackt and hyde i was terribly excited when i found out that they had made a film together and made it my mission in life to see it i was not disappointed in fact this film greatly exceeded my expectations knowing that both gackt and hyde are singers rather than actors i was prepared for brave yet not really that fulfilling performances but am delighted to say that both of them managed to keep me captivated and believing the story as it went on moon child has just the right amount of humour action romance and serious heart wrenching moments i can t say that i ve ever cried more at a film and these more tender moments are admirably acted by the pair in my opinion definitely proving their skills as actors the fight scenes are absolutely stunning and although there are a few moments of uncertainty to begin with you are quick to get into the movie and begin to bond with the characters i thoroughly recommend this film to anyone especially those who are fans of gackt and hyde

first of all i ve got to give it to the people that got this thing together is such a sensitive issue that making a movie that dares to be controversial about it takes a great deal of guts it s a shame although not surprising that the movie was banned in the us that being said i think that the movie is superb with a couple of weak moments the movie starts up with the iranian segment which turns out to be somewhat reminiscent of majid majidi s work the absolutely beautiful heaven s children and the color of paradise much like those films the clip shows what happened through the innocent eyes of a class of afgan refugees in iran absolutely beautiful clip same goes for sean penn s clip which is superb as well but just as some of the clips are beutiful others are absolutely brutal alejandro gonz les i rritu does the mexican clip and just like his gut wrenching amores perros he does it as brutal as he can most of the clip is a black screen with several sounds playing in the background those sounds are of the reporters and their shock as the second plane crashes those who called home from the burning towers and left messages for their families those who were angry and he combines this with flashes of people jumping from the towers a very hard clip to watch and one that you won t forget some clips could turn out to be very hard to watch for americans as some of the clips could be interpreted as you re not the only ones that are suffering in particular the egyptian and british clips that not only say that but turn the tables and say how much suffering the us has caused to other people i will also make a special mention to the clips from bosnia herzegovina france india and japan although this last one may seem terribly out of place it actually isn t however not all the clips are great and i make a special mention on the clip from israel which in my opinion is extremely weak while the idea was good a reporter is at the scene of a terrorist attack in tel aviv but his story gets bumped because of what happened in new york is something that a lot of us who live in countries at war can relate to the realization is terrible the clip ends up as just some entertainment reporter trying to get some air time at all costs a guy saying he s a witness and hoping that he can go on tv and soldiers and paramedics shouting just because the clip fails to capture any of the drama of such a situation if you happen to have the chance to see it then you should that is unless you re a conservative in which case you d better stay out as you might get offended but if you re not then you might learn how many of us outside the us lived through
eric valette is obviously a talented film maker and so are the two guys who wrote the script therefore mal fique is a great flick made with just a few bucks but also tons of imagination well i m a bit exaggerating but nevertheless i m sincere so if you like dark gory movies go and see this one it s really worth it
okay let s start off by saying this film is not an exact rendition of the crimes and legal pursuit of andrei chikatilo while it may have been official policy in the politburo that the ussr had no serial killers in actuality the legal system had handled others and killer x as he was actually called was already being sought when fetisov brought burakov onto the case in fact as soon as it was realized they had multiple murders on their hands the authorities assigned a task force of dozens of officers to track down and end the killing spree of a man that did not fit into what is perceived as normal serial killer parameters it s good the director and writers consistently remind the viewer that the story is only based upon actual events for a docudrama this ain t spoilers follow that said this is a damn good example of a fast paced hollywood style thriller that still gets across the basics of what happened it is easy to follow and has just enough truth behind its version of events to make for compelling viewing yes chikatilo raped and murdered both children and adults both male and female yes shoddy lab work set him free to continue killing for years yes innocent men were accused of the murders and confessed to their crimes at police urging yes the gay community was harassed while the crimes were being committed albeit with burakov s committed assistance and yes chikatilo was brought to confession not by the haranguing of the special prosecutor gorbunov but by the gentle understanding of a psychiatrist named bukhanovsky though gorbunov was really nowhere near the egotistical martinet portrayed in this film quibbles about truth and veracity aside all of these events are dramatized in a manner that consistently tightens the tension and fear it doesn t hurt that director and co writer chris gerolmo has a pitch perfect cast stephen rea s growing emotional involvement in the killings and developing expertise in detecting clues donald sutherland s snarky manipulation of the soviet party hacks and subtle spine that becomes evident when it is needed jeffrey demunn s seething undercurrent of rage hidden by a fear filled demeanor max von sydow s boyish excitement at being part of a criminal investigation all enhance the sharp dialog and crisp editing in ways that cannot be underestimated taken for what it is citizen x is almost pitch perfect the almost due to one moment of self congratulation at the end that just does not fit highly recommended as fiction well told not fact being presented but considering the junky serial killer movies that hollywood usually spits out that s good enough for me
i also saw this upon its release in and have been struck since then with its final scene if this is an answer to high noon then it s an apt and apposite response the notion that as this string is headed the town comes together is a much stronger message than the lonely personal heroism of high noon in this theme concho is a phenomenal precursor of one my other all time favorites the magnificent seven both sinatra and conrad give impressive and convincing performances especially sinatra s transformation from bullying kid brother to liberating town savior i can only hope that at some point all the friends and family on whom over the years i ve inflicted my affection for this movie will have the opportunity to experience it for themselves
i m a writer working at home and diagnosis murder is my lunchtime break companion good clean fun good humour and nostalgia for the days of the dick van dyke show how innocent we all were and how innocent is diagnosis murder i particularly enjoyed the episodes with other nostalgia figures like joe mannix the bad guys always get caught the good guys carry on the stars clearly enjoy themselves and are having a ball without taking themselves too seriously one beef why were so many of the villains women or at least bitches amanda was too dizzy its hard to imagine her really carrying out anything as gruesome as an autopsy i hope we haven t seen the last of dick van dyke and family on our screens esp at lunchtimes
i ve read countless of posts about this game being so similar to max payne when i played it the first time i thought it was a bit weird arcade like game with a desire to rip off the max payne style not just bullet time so when i played it for a couple of hours i realized how much fun it is and how different from max payne yeah the bullet time is a bit similar but i think it fits differently to the game style this game is non stop action a mix between a shoot em up and a fight em up so much fun as a big fan of max payne i must say that the storyline of dtr is not near to the greatness of max payne the graphics are a bit average and some of the levels look the same but if you want a bit more of that bullet time you should definitely own this game
in my opinion the best movie ever i love when people ask me what this film is about i usually smile and say life they shrug and probably never give it another thought the fact that everyone from every background can relate to some part of this movie makes it all that much more amazing definately a must see for everyone
i loved the real mc coys it is too bad that lydia reed has decided to be forgotten and not appear she was excellent in the show of course walter brennan was great as well as tony mart nez i loved it when he called amos se or grampa i have purchased season i on dvd and i cannot wait to buy seasons if only there would be more shows on television like this one everything would be better this show appeared briefly in the summer of but then disappeared god bless all the departed members of the cast and please llydia reed make yourself known again to the public you are loved and respected the real mc coys will live forever

sports movies have never been my thing but a small handful of them work for me the best are the those which focus less on the sport and more on the character such as raging bull the wrestler and girlfight this is a great directorial debut for karyn kusama and an outstanding first performance for michelle rodriguez girlfight feels is both realistic and involving that is enough so to make it a memorable film the plot is strait forward enough diana guzman is in her fourth year of high school but due to her picking fights in the hallway she is close to expulsion as a possible means of unleashing her anger she signs up for boxing lessons at the club where her brother is training at the wishes of there father in the course of ninety minutes we the viewers see something extraordinary diana almost literally changes from a girl to a woman we see it in her body as well as her behaviour especially when one of the boys at the club finds himself drawn to her and she gets into it there is not a bad scene or a lame contrived moment in the film the only error that i would say could be corrected is that one of the subplots ends on what feels like an unfinished note aside from that girlfight is a great movie
i saw this australian film about years ago and have never forgotten it the movie shows the horror of war in a way that hollywood usually glosses over the relationship between the soldiers of the two warring countries is highlighted by the differences in culture and the ultimate knowledge that in the end we are all really not different on the inside if you can find any type of copy of this buy or rent it you won t be disappointed just awed
i felt duty bound to watch the timothy dalton zelah clarke adaptation of jane eyre because i d just written an article about the bbc jane eyre for thescreamonline so i approached watching this the way i d approach doing homework i was irritated at first the lighting in this version is bad everyone everything is washed out in a bright white klieg light that in some scenes casts shadows on the wall behind the characters and the sound is poorly recorded i felt like i was listening to a high school play and the pancake make up is way too heavy and the sets don t fully convey the gothic mood of the novel they are too fussy too martha stewart i just can t see bronte s rochester abiding such martha stewart domestic arrangements orson welles rochester lived in cave like gloom very appropriate to the novel s gothic mood and yet with all those objections not only is this the best jane eyre i ve seen it may be the best adaptation of any novel i ve ever seen this jane eyre in spite of its technical flaws brought the feeling back to me of reading jane eyre for the first time the critics of this production say it is too close to the book for me someone who valued the book and didn t need it to be any less wordy or any less christian or any more sexed up this version s faithfulness to the novel bronte actually wrote is its finest asset bronte wrote a darn good book there s a reason it has lasted years plus while other slicker sexier and easier texts have disappeared as a long time jane eyre fan i was prejudiced against timothy dalton as rochester rochester is famously not handsome jane and rochester are literature s famous ugly couple and timothy dalton is nothing if not stunningly handsome but dalton gives a mesmerizing performance as rochester he just blew me away i ve never seen anything like his utter devotion to the role the text the dialogue and rochester s love for jane dalton brings the page s rochester to quivering life on screen rochester is meant to be a bit scary dalton is scary welles got the scary streak down too for example when he shouts enough after fontaine plays a short piano piece but dalton is scary more than once here you really can t tell if he s going to hurt jane or himself in his desperation rochester s imperiousness his humor his rage his vulnerability dalton conveys all sometimes seconds apart it s stunning and here s the key thing the actor performing rochester has to convey that he has spent over a decade of his life in utter despair lonely living with an ugly life destroying secret no other actor i ve seen attempt this part conveys that black hole of despair as timothy dalton does current fan favorite toby stephens doesn t even try dalton hits it out of the park if i saw timothy dalton performing rochester in a singles bar i would say that guy is trouble don t even look at him he s that radioactive with tamped down agony zelah clarke is not only overall the best jane i ve seen she s one of the very few janes whom producers were willing to cast as the book casts jane no folks who know jane eyre only from the version bronte did not describe a statuesque robust jane with finely arched eyebrows and pouty lips rather charlotte bronte s jane is indeed poor plain obscure and little and not pretty zelah has a small mouth close set eyes and a bit of a nose she s truly little she is no fashion model and she is the best jane the truest to the book some described her a cold or boring no she s true to the book bronte s jane is not a red hot mama she s a sheltered deprived teen whose inner passions come out only at key moments as zelah s do here the book s jane is someone you have to watch slowly carefully patiently observantly if you want to truly plumb her depths you have to watch zelah here to get to know who she really is i would have liked to have seen more fire in zelah in one key scene but that s one scene out of five hours in which she is otherwise very good in spite of its closeness to the text this version like every other version i ve seen shys away from fully explicating the overtly christian themes in jane eyre christianity is not incidental subtext in jane eyre it is central helen burns instructs jane in christianity thus giving her a subversive counter cultural way to read and live her apparently doomed pinched life it is christianity and a christian god who convinces poor plain obscure jane of her equal worth her need to live up to her ideals and her rejection of a key marriage proposal that isn t made fully clear here in any case charlotte bronte wrote an excellent complex rich novel and this adaptation of it of all the ones i ve seen mines and honors the novel best of any adaptation i ve seen and that says a lot other versions that don t fully honor the book end up being a chore to watch in many places if you don t care about what charlotte bronte has to say about child abuse or the hypocrisy of a culture built on looks and money your adaptation of much of the book will be something people fast forward through to get to the kissing scenes between jane and rochester this version like bronte s novel realizes that everything bronte wrote about jane s experiences at lowood and her relationship to st john are part of what makes jane s relationship to rochester as explosive and unforgettable as it is
house of games is a flawlessly constructed film and one of the few films i have seen that had me gaping at the screen in astonishment at how cleverly and unexpectedly it ends i first saw it on video a few years back after reading roger ebert s review which proclaimed it the best film of i had my doubts mainly because it is not quite as well known as other films from that year boy was i in for a surprise this was one of the smartest most well written movies i had ever seen the screenplay is quite a piece of work not only in terms of the plot which twists and turns and pulls the rug out from under you just when you think you have it all figured out but also in terms of character development on my second viewing i began to realize that mamet s screenplay succeeds not only as a clever suspense film but that each plot development contributes to our understanding of the characters and their motivations the climax of the movie is particularly effective because it is absolutely inevitable it stems naturally from what we know about the characters and it is therefore much more than just an arbitrary twist ending the performances by lindsay crouse and joe mantegna also add enormously to the film i cannot picture any other actor besides mantegna playing the role of mike and crouse plays her role with just the right amount of restraint to suggest a repressed criminal mindset their work plus mamet s extraordinary screenplay combine to create one of the greatest films of the s it is truly a must see
night of the living homeless was a fairly strong finish to the first half of season obviously a parody of various zombie movies most notably dawn of the dead this episode parallels the homeless with the living dead as creatures who feed and thrive off of spare change rather than brains kyle is blamed for the sudden mass outbreak of homeless people when he out of the goodness of his heart gives a to a homeless man in front of his house more homeless people begin to infiltrate south park until the town is completely overrun with them this is a very strong randy marsh episode as he assumes the role of the shotgun wielding leader of the adults who take refuge on the roof of the park county community center but before randy makes it to the community center he is accosted by hundreds of homeless people while hilariously screaming i don t have any change unfortunately the refugees end up losing gerald broflofski to the homeless when he tries to escape by catching a bus out of town and unwittingly tosses away all his change for the bus to distract the homeless people then he becomes one of them asking everyone for change the boys attempt to find out why there are so many homeless people in south park and find a man who is a director of homeless studies they find out that the nearby city of evergreen used to have a similar problem with the homeless so they escape to evergreen to find out what they did to solve the problem unfortunately homeless people break into the man s house and he attempts to take the easy way out by shooting himself however he fails several times as he shoots himself in the jaw in the eye in the chest in the neck in the shoulder screaming horribly until he finally dies this scene may have been funnier had a similar scene not happened in fantastic easter special two weeks ago meanwhile a member of the refugees discovers that due to the homeless problem the property values have nosedived thus the bank has foreclosed on his house making him homeless randy immediately turns on him holding the gun to the man s head when the man finally begs the others for a few bucks to help him out randy pulls the trigger in evergreen the boys find out that the citizens of the town sent the homeless to south park and that the passing of homeless from town to town happens all over the country the boys modify a bus that leads the homeless out of south park and takes them all the way to santa monica california the zombie movie parallels and the great randy marsh lines make this one definitely re watchable
i first saw breaking glass when it was released in england in i loved it then and having just caught it in august on a canadian station it still is great the only thing i regret is i can t find the sound track or the dvd in the stores anyone care to shed some light or must i order it from some over priced internet company but getting back to the film the music stands up to the test of time hazel kate had something to say about s britain actually it was the same decade i moved to canada for some of the same reasons one being thatcher and what she was doing to the country at the time please if you get the chance watch this movie you won t be sorry
following a roughly year rocky road on nbc it was decided to do just one last super installment the series had been on the bubble several times thanks to not having the numbers that would qualify it as a block buster of a tv hour it had always had a sizable hard core of hard corps of followers it was almost as if the series with the full title of homicide life on the street was a sort of mr in between of series it was too big to just cancel but too small to get a case of rabid ratings ravings over during the precarious tenure on friday evenings they had presented some of the best and most daringly artistic of hourly dramas there i ve said it artistic artistic but please remember we mean artistic but not just phony pretentious pedantic politically correct preaching when at last it was a sure thing that it was the end of the line for homicide this super episode was prepared as this hour made for tv movie looking at all the past seasons happenings and parade of regular characters the production team went out and gave us what proved to be a super send off our story as we join the story we find that baltimore homicide unit commanding officer lt al giardello has pulled the pin retired from the job that is but g isn t ready to really retire retire yet so instead of a rocking chair o a fishing rod we find that al is running for mayor of charm city while out in the city making some campaign stops and speeches the former detective lieutenant takes an assassin s bullet alive but in a comatose state he is taken to the hospital news spreads quickly and as if officially summoned we find all of the detectives of the baltimore unit we ve seen on the show showing up to offer their services and assistance there is a great meeting of all of these former and present gumshoes as they pitch in and follow every lead and possibility of a lead the producer found a way to deal with those who had died previously in bringing their memory into the story they managed to answer some long standing questions and even introduced some here to unrevealed ones the whole story winds up the series in a most satisfying and original way but at least for now we ll leave that as classified in wrapping up everything into a neat little package this tv movie surely gets our endorsement as for grading the homicide movie we must give it an a or a even but no matter the grade here it didn t score as high as a typical weekly episode
out of the first five episodes of hammer s short running hammer house of horror series this fifth episode with the wonderful title the house that bled to death is arguably the creepiest one as a great fan of the hammer studios gothic horror films for many years i wonder what took me so long to finally start watching the series quite recently so far i ve only seen the first five episodes and i have a strong feeling that the best is yet to come but even if the series stays as entertaining as the first five episodes are i will be satisfied whereas the second and third episodes were great to watch for their morbid and ingeniously dark sense of humor this fifth entry is definitely the one out of the first five that delivers the most genuine horror the episode begins when an elderly man murders his wife out of unknown motivations years later william nicholas ball and emma peters rachel davies move in the house with their little daughter sophie emma ridley soon after moving in however the family have to find out that there is something terribly wrong with the house which is seemingly haunted the second episode directed by francis megahy is a lot better than his mediocre previous entry growing pains episode and the fairly unknown actors deliver good performances the film is also well made in terms of effects cinematography and score the house that bled to death is a solid episode that delivers the elements that my fellow hammer fans should like to see in a short horror tale the film delivers a creepy atmosphere genuine scare moments and intelligent twists and is suspenseful and highly entertaining from the beginning to the end overall this is highly recommendable to hammer fans
this movie s origins are a mystery to me as i only know as much as imdb did before i rented it i assume that before starship troopers killshot was one of the countless unaired pilots that never made it to network cable or otherwise the new title of kill shot is comically thrown into the opening sequence the first of many quick clues that this was not ever intended for the cinema the quick cuts cheesy melrose place music and short second close up candid shots of the main actors let you know what you re in for and i don t mind at all i rented this movie seeing the repackaging that puts casper van dien and denise richards on the cover in front of a volleyball net thinking it would be funny to see them in a movie besides the scifi travesty of starship troopers an excellent book in my opinion not so hot a movie but that s another review after looking it up on imdb my roommate and i surmised that the pilot was dragged up after the apparent success of troopers and richards own career see bond girl and wild things references here they threw in a sex scene involving a minor character to reach the coveted r rated status coveted in suspense video rental sections that is in any event they should have left it unrated if you re trying to sell it in the suspense softcore porn section all in all it s entertaining i hate to spoil the fun of telling you it s a tv pilot though that was the biggest pull while watching it when you expect a cinematic movie and get a tv show the differences between them make themselves more clear than usual would i rent it again no would i watch this tv show well why not it s better than baywatch and their meager attempts at hitting all demographics would have done well back in the mid s token black guy who s gay to avoid the tv taboo of inter racial dating token asian japanese i assume from the name koji more adept at science and computers than talking to women beautiful intelligent latina pre med student who has everything going for her except her family s bank account this show probably would have done ok but as a movie it just cracks me i gave it a out of considering what it was and what it was forced to become it made for a very enjoyable evening and that s all i ask of rentals
well was morgan freeman any more unusual as god than george burns this film sure was better than that bore oh god i was totally engrossed and lmao all the way through carrey was perfect as the out of sorts anchorman wannabe and aniston carried off her part as the frustrated girlfriend in her usual well played performance i for one don t consider her to be either ugly or untalented i think my favorite scene was when carrey opened up the file cabinet thinking it could never hold his life history see if you can spot the file in the cabinet that holds the events of his bathroom humor i was rolling over this one well written and even better played out this comedy will go down as one of this funnyman s best
so being a fairly deep fan of horror movies it s been a while since i ve seen one that really made me jump or fidget nervously definitely going to get this on dvd when it comes out a hell of a lot better than the ring the thing that i don t get is that so many people that we talkd with after the movie thought that it was horrible well if that s what you think then so be it i know what i liked and it takes a fair amount to get me to actually feel scared so i have to say that this one is worth watching now you might be disappointed in the story if you need everything in a neat and tidy line because the plot goes back an forth a little bit to help build the story i think that if it was shown in chronological order it would have ruined the whole thing i m actually glad that this movie had very little bloody messes in it maybe the rest of you studio writers and whathaveyous will realize that you don t have to splash the red stuff all over the set to make people afraid
what keeps us going or at least what i feel the writer wanted us to keep us glued at an early point is our desire to know whether martinaud has done the dirty deed without spoiling so much of course there is a red herring and a twist but then we discover that this is the story of martinaud s imperfections and his difficulty in coping when there is the revelation we begin to sympathize and pity him because as the story progresses we are made to think he is the sick perverted pedophiliac that we re predisposed to have in mind one of those things he has to cope with is the distant gap he and his wife have even though they live on the same roof these problems of course are given their denouement in the film s shocking finale this movie demands your patience and it has certainly tried those of restless teenagers sitting at the rear they were heckling obviously because they aren t partial to central location films although there is a bit of travelling when we get to the woods and the beach and we realize that gallien isn t as clever as we are made to think he is the inquisitor is
wow it s been years since i last saw this movie watching it in is certainly different than watching it in initially i didn t think i would make it through the movie hunt stevenson michael keaton was so obnoxious arrogant and disrespectful that i found it hard to watch him he embodied every negative stereotype of americans if that wasn t bad enough once the small american town s finest workers were shown the image only got worse on the opposite spectrum the japanese were presented as emotionless robotic workaholics the movie wasn t even all that funny i only hung in there because of the nostalgic value of it and i m glad i continued the watch just like boxing judges are swayed by how you finish the round this movie went from about a three up to the seven i rated it because of the ending the end was excellent you always want a harmonious ending and this was just that it was great that the town got to keep there jobs and keep the factory but what was most special was the marriage between the japanese customs and values and the american customs and values it was a mediocre movie that ended on a high note
okay i am a fan of the nightmare series and everyone says on here that this is the worst but it s not haven t s you seen freddy s revenge wtf that was the worst of all now this movie is pretty decent and it sticks to the freddy story and it s cool that he had a daughter etc etc and then i found out it was in d i was so excited i remember when i saw it on the dvd box set i instantly skipped to the d sequences quite a lot was in d though like lisa zanes hand dream demons freddy s claw more than once lezlie dean holding a knife lisa zane with a baseball bat doc s hand freddy s head exploding i truly loved this movie because it was in d but i wish the whole movie was in d not just the last minutes by the way it s minutes not ten
i have no idea how imdb sorts reviews but i do know that as happens often on amazon com there are a striking number of very negative reviews for this movie which repeat the same somewhat obscure talking points almost verbatim a campaign only imdb knows as for this movie it s fine it s a funny cute and very straightforward movie it s been over a decade since i worked in brooklyn lived in queens and visited relatives in the south bronx but i found nothing inauthentic or exploitative about these kids is the grandmother a bizarre character yup do the dialogue and plot acknowledge this yes thankfully they do are other movies set in the les and featuring dominican puerto rican kids possible you betcha does that make this movie a crime as some of the to my eyes astroturf comments would suggest hardly let a thousand plastic flowers bloom this is better than any episode of degrassi jr high or degrassi high scoff at the comparison but we ve never had that and i m touched to the core by this movie s humility of purpose and tender spirit that said i d love to know the backstory behind all this backbiting d
any way the wind blows is tom barmans who is also know as front man of the rock formation deus debut movie entirely shot in antwerp belgium the movie starts on a sunny friday morning and skips rather superficially between the events that fill the day of a dozen of main characters when the movie ends you have a lot of stuff to think about because most of the different story lines are left wide open the movie has a purely instrumental sound track that will rock your socks off in most scenes the music truly enhances the general atmosphere and feel really making the movie hallucinating to watch at certain points of time the main scene in the film the party is very well shot the director didn t hesitate to use video clip techniques having his main characters dancing on one of the best sound tracks i ve heard lately the screenplay is great stuff camera angles and colors are very well chosen the costumes are very hot and very seventies too and i loved most of the acting the thing i liked most about the movie are the subtle touches of absurd surreal very dry or even cynical humor that interleave without claiming to be a comedy this movie certainly is not a comedy but rather an alternative piece of art it still manages to have its audience giggling and even burst into laughter at some times this is one more directors debut that shouldn t be an ending i hope to see more tom barman movies in the future because i had a good time cheers
this motion picture has a steady haunting pace backed up with great acting one of chamberlain s best performances and a story that is revealed to us over time beyond that the music fully establishes the mood and assists in maintaining an uneasy cautious and somber tone weir s story is enhanced by using aboriginals their stories and their tensions with the dominant white population to deliver a fantasy tale that is ominous although they are unrelated in story as well as genre this maintained the same feeling within me as ursula le guin s lathe of heaven the last wave is a dramatic thriller with some shocking moments remember hacking and slicing doesn t make a film a horror movie it s the psychological element of fear and trepidation that rests within us all
a simple movie in the beginning a simple movie in the end it does have that un ending and pretending cliche but most tv movies have that any ways christopher reeve does a good job as being an ex con drifter the marriage between her and the woman he works for i feel is a bit queer but i believe for the time period it is set in that it is believable none the less now i saw the edited tv version even tho the movie was made and showed on tv i find that a bit queer as well but i feel if i saw the entirety of the piece i would give it more in likely the same rating j t walsh does a nice job not his best role but still a nice job
class reunion is a very underated comedy gem it s and the class of lizzie borden high return for there year reunion among them are the usual stereotypes the hunk babe the fat guy nerd etc but the former students are in for a bumpy night one of their classmates is walter baloer the class wimp who was subject to a comedy prank by the rest of the class on graduation night and since then has been in a mental home walter escapes and now plans to avenge his humiliation despite the dark premise this is really just an excuse for lots of very funny gags set pieces to say too much more would spoil the film but if you enjoyed the naked gun airplane movies you ll love this what other film offers a music cameo by chuck berry a great comedy which deserves a wider audience
across the country and especially in the political landscape people with any kind of political ambition should take time out to see this film the movie is called city hall and with little imagination its synopsis can take place anywhere in america it just so happens to open in new york here we have the story of a popular politician named mayor john pappas al pacino with enough savvy to run a major metropolitan city with very little effort his right hand man is none other than deputy mayor kevin calhoun john cusack an equally bright individual who s ambitions are tied to his mentor and both seemed destined for higher office everything points in that direction until a police shooting ignites an investigation spearheaded by marybeth cogan bridget fonda who believes the guilt points towards city hall and the mayor a six year old boy and a police officer s death are blamed on a career criminal who s questionable freedom leads to an apparent cover up by political pay offs and city corruption involving union leaders like danny aiello played by frank anselmo corrupt judicial officials like judge walter stern martin landau and mafia bosses like paul zapatti anthony franciosa who are deeply involved also implicated are party officials like larry schwartz richard schiff who works for the probation office of new york but it is the bond between the mayor and his deputy which is taken to task by the accidental shooting a great vehicle for cusack and a sure bet nominee to become a classic
to my surprise i quite enjoyed spacecamp i remember seeing it about years ago and recently i hired it again i was quite impressed obviously the special effects in todays space films such as armageddon and deep impact are far superior to those in spacecamp however this film had a story a very stereotypical eighties story where you could almost recite the next line of dialogue before hearing it but thats what i liked about it they don t make films like this anymore so it was a refreshing change it was interesting to see kelly preston leaf phoenix and lea thomson in early roles with tom skerrit and kate capshaw to add substance to the light fluffy plot absolutely loved the robot named jinx it was very cute but it unfortunately had more emotion than some of the main characters the film was almost inspirational in its own way and it was interesting to note that it was filmed at the nasa spacecamp in alabama i think
having seen charley boorman in long way round with ewan mcgregor i was very interested to see how charley would be in his own show i thought charley came across as a lovely guy who is very grounded and down to earth its nice to see that celebrities struggle with their weight and fitness it just show s their human too i don t know a lot about bikes but this show gripped me right from the start the preparation and organising for this event seems immense the event itself seems very dangerous and i m fascinated to see why charley and everyone else is doing it and how far he gets i love the pace of the show and the fast upbeat music i can t believe he broke his collar bone i really hope its not the end i cant wait to see the next episode
i feel this is one of the best movies i ve seen i m an older male and love most westerns i love movies based in part at least on facts if i am not mistaken this is such a movie i also like revenge type movies this qualifies there as well in my opinion some of my favorite parts of the movie were the opening scene with the whipping and the barn shooting scene i felt the corral beating scene was a little overkill but did not affect how i feel about the complete movie i saw what i think is a continuation of this movie in a gun smoke episode i also enjoyed that i recommend taking the time to watch this movie i will watch it again i also felt the romance parts of this movie were well played i thought it was so out of character for randy travis to play a villain type but i always enjoy his acting
i really enjoyed this drama from sidney lumet the best word i could come up to describe it with is insane it throws the viewer around for an hour and fifty minutes and doesn t let you breathe until the credits start to roll at the very end trust me this movie will keep you guessing the entire way through the story is very well crafted and almost brilliant it s almost like a more complicated tarantino type story the acting is all amazing from all of the leads and even the small parts excellent cast i also loved the cinematography it gave it the real feeling as if it were an independent film it was all great this movie is excited exhausting and heartbreaking it s almost hard to watch but you ll be glad that you did
it takes a serbian or at least a balkan familiarity to understand and enjoy many of the situations characters and jokes of zavet as well as of many other films of kusturica see for example the opening scenes with the remote village in the serbian mountains with the low tech devices that defend the integrity and way of life of the inhabitants the nostalgia for the good days of the communist rule and the awakening of the young brat watching his nude teacher at the sounds of the soviet hymn kusturica not only tries to depart from the tragic history of serbia described in his previous movies but creates a whole world of himself in the process this is not a political film or not an explicit political film in any case it s a fun film before all kusturica creates a set of characters that we care about music plays an active role in this film same as in all his other movies his style is direct and grotesque we now what he feels about his characters and we know that he wants us to feel the same the space he develops melds present history and magic and the colours seem to be of a douanier rousseau of modern cinema this is not a perfect film either the principal flaw is the length some editing and shortening would have been useful as at some point in time the director seems to have run out of ideas and repetitions show up it is yet one of the most catching amusing moving films that i have seen lately
i don t remember when i first heard about this movie but i rented it about six years ago and it still remains one of my favorite comedies i will admit you probably will despise this movie if you know nothing about rap music but if you are a rap fan even a casual one you will love the inside jokes and references one of the best lines in the movie is about the difference between a b and a h i still use this line today and get lots of laughs with it one of the best performances comes from larry scott who played nerd lamar in revenge of the nerds it is unfortunate that this movie will likely never get a dvd release
now i know french inmates are unlikely to have read lovecraft and that proves my point that his writings should be taught in school maybe as a separate subject but how did they think something that sounds like ftagn yog sototh could possibly lead to any good the movie takes place in a prison where four very unlikely cell mates stumble upon a magical book that may if read right get them out as prisons go the cell was totally unrealistic so that made it hard for me to get into the atmosphere of things it also moves rather slowly which may bore people but other than that this is top notch horror feeling mixing sartre s hell is other people with a lovecraft barker type of story and doing rather successfully bottom line take the time to watch this that means not doing it when you are about to go to work or to sleep or while doing something else this is a movie that works best if you are immersed into it lessons to be learned yog is bad almost as bad as french women
this movie is one of my very favorites it s hard to explain why maybe it s the innocence of corin nemec and his awkwardness paired with the boldness of cheryl pollak but it definitely has something to do with the soundtrack also some of the characters have little lines or movements or moments that are amusing in and of themselves finally the story is one that always tugs at my heartstrings and the last scene is so bittersweet all in all i love this movie it s perfect for a gooey sentimental girls night
yes this a b grade horror but at least the producers directors and cast does not pretend this flick is manna from heaven the plot is corny a psychotic serial killer on his way to execution is splashed with genetic acid turning him into a snow man the snowman a k a jack frost then goes on a murdering rampage to find the small town sheriff that finally arrested him with a limited budget the crew had to make do with limited special effects most of the money appears to spent on the snowman s costume particullary difficult shots are managed by cartoons or pan away shots shots where the camera moves away to disguise the details this is no kid s movie and should not be confused with disney movie of the same title if you do not let your children watch pg movies alone than parents should not let their kids watch this movie this movie has two claims to fame the beatiful shannon elizabeth american pie did her first major movie role the scene where jack frost attacks shannon elizabeth is worth watching a few times this movie has the worst snowman joke ever the joke is so bad that the directors credit the joke teller in the credit list
i first saw this movie about years ago and i was expecting something funny similar to cb i was blown away i was on the floor laughing my butt off this movie is so great way better than cb the characters the songs the plot everything top notch independent film that was given two thumbs up by siskel and egbert and if two old white guys can understand the humour in this flick you know it s good
im a huge m lillard fan that s why i ended up watching this movie honestly i doubt that if he wasn t in the movie i would of enjoyed it as much or even watched it but once i did watch it realize the story was pretty decent a bad ending i must say but i did see it coming it s a low budget movie and some of the actors weren t really good but all in all i rated this movie the suspense of wondering what lillard was actually up to was what really keeped me interested in this movie its a good rental
i can remember seeing this movie as a kid in or hbo would show it late at night back when they were they one and only movie pay channel in existence back then it was unrated and was the only movie of its kind ever shown on pay television especially back then i would love to see it now as an adult where i would be more apt to understand the adult theme of it it was probably the closest thing i had ever seen to pornography at the young age of or luckily i had stupid babysitters and party going parents on the weekends most of my memory of this movie was the completely erratic sexual behavior of these two guys breaking into houses to sniff underwear feeding on a stranger s breast milk on a public bus and fornicating in a cab at the request of one of their female subjects were just a few of the whacked escapades these guys were pulling off a very racy film for the early s until i checked imdb i had no idea this movie had such a following most people i talk to have never heard of it
a community pool in connecticut is the setting for this under the radar film which is charming funny entertaining and appealing although it won prizes in major film festivals the big bad swim was not released to hordes of theaters across america but was distributed in dvd form and shown in theaters selectively it is unfortunate that the big bad swim never had the marketing hype of a hollywood release considering how many sinkers hollywood has released this year such as i know who killed me the big bad swim a genuinely good independent film has had to swim upstream on its own nevertheless in the big bad swim actress paget brewster is endearing and believable as amy the wired to breaking point math teacher who not only is being dumped by her husband but also is about to lose her job and ends up taking a gamble on a new life tv soap actor jeff branson who is hot plays noah the earnest vulnerable swim teacher who goes the extra pool length to help his students overcome their fears and discovers he can learn from his students pretty sexy jess weixler did i just see her in a bank commercial deftly plays jordan the swimmer to be who works two jobs one as a pole dancer the other as a blackjack dealer her character provides the catalyst for change amongst the ensemble but is the least understandable of the characters because of a lack of a back story or motivation as to why she does what she does jordan is young enough to still live at home with a ubiquitous video camera toting younger brother who spies on her however her parents are not shown to be involved with her life in any way which seems odd there s no drunken mother or abusive father here to explain why a normal attractive girl from a connecticut suburb would choose to be a self medicating pole dancer who debases herself for loutish bachelor parties despite this quibble the big bad swim succeeds in large part because it is a happy feel good film as one might expect learning to swim is the metaphor for life ultimately it s better to jump in with both feet and get in the swim rather than sit on the deck because life happens to you anyway the big bad swim is a great date movie a great dorm movie a great what haven t i seen movie and men like it as well as women
one of the best low budget movies from germany is this is the dark side of new age if you believe in esoteric please don t watch this movie it blows all your positive fantasies away this movie shows that beyond the peaceful fa ade of spiritual soul searching lies a world of extreme transgressions and terror i hope there will be a mm copy soon andreas marschall s first film is just the beginning of a new area making movies with a few euros i m waiting for the second hit
in a lot of his films citizen kane confidential report touch of evil orson welles gave him the role of an exuberant men in the lady from shanghai it s the only time i see him holding the role of the victim the role of the culprit he gave it to rita hayworth i guess it s because he was in love with her therefore it s an interesting film but i find the story excellent too the direction is genius as usual with welles two scenes are particularly brilliant the one in the aquarium and the final one with the mirrors this film is brilliant
david and bathsheba is a lavish hollywood biblical picture produced out of th century fox by darryl f zanuck directed by henry king and starring gregory peck king david susan hayward bathsheba raymond massey nathan kieron moore uriah and jayne meadows michal the film is based around the second old testament book of samuel from the holy bible it follows king david who as a child had slain the giant goliath and now we find him in adulthood as the second king of israel a tough and assured king david however has affairs of the heart causing great problems for once he spies bathsheba taking a shower re bath it s the start of a journey encompassing adultery and betrayal a journey that will end in the judgement of god being called upon typically for the genre david bathsheba is a large grandiose production from its excellent set designs to it s positively gorgeous technicolor photography leon shamroy it has enough quality to warrant sitting along side the best the genre has to offer as regards production values untypically tho the film is sedately paced and relies on of its worth being driven purely by dialogue this is not one for action fans or anyone who needs some swash to go with their buckle this is a very humanist picture in fact lets not beat around the burning bush here it s a biblical love story flecked with sins of the heart but that is no bad thing at all because breaking it down we find it s very well acted peck has a stoic yet vulnerable thing going on real well hayward is pushing it to the max and it be a fine story directed with knowing skill by the often forgotten henry king and although some of the dialogue is admittedly cringe inducing the character flow is never interrupted as phillip dunne s the ghost and mrs muir oscar nominated screenplay holds the attention throughout sometimes a forgotten picture in terms of the biblical swords sandals genres most likely because it is a talky piece that has heart as its main selling point but really it s well worth the time of anyone interested in the most lavish of genres
everything i remember about it was excellent great cast with sam waterston george innes before he became more familiar to us audiences excellent scripts as only the english can do edwardian sherlock holmes lord peter wimsey albert campion type mysteries but with a jules verne twist sort of like macgyver would have been had it been in england years earlier right at the beginning of the scientific technological revolution of the th century i ve often wondered if the creators of macgyver saw these shows macgyver first aired about years later i still have episode on a much deteriorated tape
while this was a better movie than dalmations live action not animated version i think it still fell a little short of what disney could do it was well filmed the music was more suited to the action and the effects were better done compared to the acting was perhaps better but then the human characters were given far more appropriate roles in this sequel and glenn close is really not to be missed as in the first movie she makes it shine her poor lackey and the overzealous furrier sidekicks are wonderful characters to play off of and they add to the spectacle disney has given us this is a great family film with little or no objectionable material and yet it remains fun and interesting for adults and children alike it s bound to be a classic as so many disney films are here s to hoping the third will be even better still because you know they probably want to make one
cinematically this film stinks so does a lot of the acting but idon t care if there is a strong representation of what the s werelike for a lot of us in the innercity anyways and what hip hop zulunation and break dancing were really like great music greatdancing it almost seems like a documentary of a time now pastwhen hip hop was a way of life it s also interesting to see newyork looking like ground zero from a nuclear attack some viewersmay be too young to remember that it was a poor run down cityduring the s and s this is the best of all the hip hop breakdancing movies that came out around that period of course the s are considered a joke now with all the bad tv shows andmovies but those of us who lived through it will always rememberit fondly for a time when music dancing and graffiti were fresh yo
first let s get the hoopla out of the way hedy lamarr was regarded as one of the most beautiful of women and the movies were a perfect medium for the many to see her beauty on screen here we have hedy as a young fresh faced year old speaking in her native austrian i recently bought a uncensored version of this classic yes we see a brief close up of hedy bare from the waist up but although she filmed the swimming runaway horse scenes naked the director gustav machaty uses the cover of branches reflections in puddles medium and long shots to show her thus in this famous scene so don t go imagining there are any lascivious close ups or clinches her boyfriend pierre nay keeps his clothes on at all times yes fairly daring for its day but how innocous it looks now through eyes as other learned reviews have stated this film should be looked at for the imagary expressionism and allegorical statements it makes with pictures of drops of water forming a ripple on the surface of a pale of water farm machinery landscapes etc sweet sounding strings run for most of extase s length and the film has a feel of a transition between silent and sound in its direction and concept the script is highly minimalist and economical the story being mainly imparted through the medium of facial and bodily gestures with just a few words of german spoken by the actors with english subtitles beneath even these few words seem almost superflous in the general lyrical vein which runs through the film put very simply this is the story of a young girl who marries a much older man why we are never told and what did eva see in him anyway money who is then trapped in an unconsumated and loveless marriage she then returns to her father having left her husband and her father has to lie to his son in law after a ride on her horse eva decides to take a swim in the buff and loads up her clothes onto her horse s saddle however her horse gets romantic notions itself and gallops off to greet its stablemate hedy rushes out of the lake naked and tries to recover her mount but an engineer at work sees and retrieves the horse then looks around for its owner and so the romance is born her husband seeing that his rival must win eva later decides to shoot himself but i thought this was rather illogical and its main weakness bearing in mind his previous loveless relationship with eva despite being a reissue title on vhs the sound being years old is a bit soft and with background crackles in line with films of its age after a period of mourning our handsome boyfriend obviously is so in love with eva he imagines her as a mother with an infant so we have to assume they live happily ever after just let the imagary wash over you and disabuse your mind of the style of films even of late s vintage this is a lyrical piece that can be enyoyed for its own sake and not just for its eye catching title i gave it
let me be up front i like pulp however it is like one of these easier dives that you see at the olympics it has to be marked down a little because it is easier to give a cheap thrill than drag you inside the world of say a late medieval painter this is only a two hour ghost train ride and while often or more accurately most of the time ludicrous and unlikely it always goes forward and it always entertains if not always in the right way check out the memorable quotes section for a chuckle however quite why it has been given a worst film razzie is baffling i bet there was a thousand worse films made in but this film got the treatment because it was viewed as a fashionable victim head case and popular novelist catherine tramell sharon stone is now over in london writing a novel but death and destruction follow her around like flies follow a horse during a spot of hot weather god heavens she can t even visit the toilet without tripping over at least two corpses and i am sure if she opened the closet in her vast penthouse flat one would come tumbling out in grand hollywood style yes clearly a very dangerous lady to be circling around if you like your pulse to be above zero but is she personally responsible i mean why would anyone put two and two together and start thinking she might be a murderer equally her reaction to such accusations seems very casual however is this just a personality disorder some form of b s risk addiction or further evidence of her guilt for reasons i cannot fully understand or explain stone is assigned to psychiatrist michael glass david morrissey for evaluation rather than taken down the cells following another lover found dead in mysterious circumstances thankfully for stone he is far crazier than any of his patients and has a troubled home working life of his own in the blink of an eye the relationship changes from doctor to patient and then it is hard to tell because it all becomes something of a revolving blur in to this heady mix comes roy washburn a strange welsh sounding david thewlis who tells the love struck doctor in his capacity of policeman of many years standing that the lady in question may be dangerous i mean hold the front page however glass is now too glassy eyed to realise or care like a dizzy boxer in front of a prime time mike tyson he ripe for the big take down however not before finding that washburn might have a secret or two himself now comes millena gardosh charlotte rampling a fellow psychiatrist and a rare example in this film of someone who isn t barking mad or else a murder suspect presuming that she has actually watched the finished film she must look back with nostalgia when her underwear came off with the ease of stone s thankfully for us at least those days are long gone strangely she doesn t think stone is quite as dangerous as everyone else or else she doesn t think the script is good enough or her cheque large enough to do any proper acting after several laps of the track roughly outlined above it comes to a climax that mixes provincial rep with a cliff hanger twist that while as farcical as the rest of the movie gives us enough elbowroom for basic instinct highly unlikely this may be at this point in time
i have seen this film many times and i like all bad teachers want to give it ten out of ten but feel that it would be unfair to other good films however i do think that this is one of those rare gems a perfect comedy it is i would venture one of the greatest comic films of all times matthau and lemmon are perfectly matched and mismatched the script is so sharp that you need to staunch the bleeding the story is well known and has already been described in other comments the two leads give extraordinary performances the girls are superb and the situations are side splittingly funny not one swear word in sight mark that hollywood you don t have to swear to be funny you have to be witty and the move from stage to film is seamless they don t make em like this any more timeless
this film does not fail to engage and move even in to an audience only familiar with modern over produced sound and computer enhanced techniques the experience of the movie goer in who could only see this in a cinema with others on their big screen must have been truly profound and a thoroughly satisfying experience one has to ask could a film maker today make a two hour silent movie and make it interesting and achieve the same structure tempo and balance as this movie has silent film making was pure art it had to hold the attention through its structure direction and acting there was no padding out with more words or computer generated distractions a poorly made or uninteresting silent movie is unwatchable this film needs to be put into context for those who might be disconcerted with the mention of christian themes this is not a christiany film it is not selling anything these themes along with reference to current moral standards often appear in this era also church going on sundays was a national past time christianity was a given in most households thus the film is only depicting normal life as it was then the themes would have rung true and deep at the time it is most odd given the strong support to good christian thinking of this particular movie and it is not preaching religion to anyone only highlighting the difference between hypocrites and the honest that in a pastor in an open debate with a representative from the film industry with a large crowd denounced pickford as an example of immorality along with some other individuals he named ny times maybe they should have watched this movie that also came out in and learned some lessons the pastor complained that since the film industry had started church attendance had dropped the film representative in the debate however made the following observations that saloon attendance had also dropped that there were far more pastors in prison than actors fact and that selecting a few examples from among the many was not representative of the whole thus there was an ongoing battle between church and the film industry during the early days of film this is a wonderful film about being honest and true to family friends and to be willing to make sacrifices mary pickford naive honest feisty full of happiness and joy faithful humorous and silently sacrificing though poor and uneducated she represented the perfect character this however is not thrust down our throat but revealed bit by bit through the film this is reminiscent of some modern chinese films where characters are slowly languidly revealed over the course of a film and it is this tempo that creates a stronger connection with the character it has a smooth even tempo for the first half that builds all the elements for the last section the last minutes are great film making and it has to be appreciated it was achieved without the benefit of sound running dialog it was achieved through deft acting and great directing it is sometimes surprising to realize that at the end of the film you haven t hear a word spoken but it feels like you have heard everything the supporting cast put in great performances especially gloria hope jean hersholt and lloyd hughes the final few minutes are typical pickford understated humor as she goes outside under the pretext of sweeping the snow a near perfect balance and ending this is a special type of touching humor that should not be underestimated chaplin used this device often and copied some of from pickford another special observation to be made about silent films and especially pickford films is that the star often has to hold the camera for much of the movie without the audience becoming jaded or bored with the actors over exposure that pickford is usually thoroughly the center of attention through most of her movies but the people still couldn t get enough of her is a testament to her fine acting ability
best movie ever this movie broke my ribs just by the force of laughter but it was well worth it i don t intend to do a summary of this excellent movie just go see it if you have the chance i think you will either love it or hate it that s the qualities of a real cult movie
this is an excellent documentary packed with racing action beautiful pictures and a great story the imax cameras give you a very wide perspective as a dvd movie it is perfect your hear every speaker working almost all the time the film is not speeded up and just gives you the natural feel of mph of course there are some sound effects added but i think they are good they give a depth to the driving scenes
simon s carefully written dialogues are truly electrified by matthau and burns you can literally hear the script crackle there are few movies out there that can develop such a relationship between the actors and the script for example the famed reunion scene could have been a lot duller with less quality actors involved matthau seems to had been born to play willie clark of course oscar moreso in the odd couple and with all of the little idiosyncracies and mannerisms that matthau crams into the character the line where he is arguing that he is with it since he lives in the city whereas lewis lives in the country that lewis is out of touch is the quintessential example of this make this one of the best performances i ve ever seen of any actor in any role be it comedic or drama or whatever else period matthau and burns work excellently together the contrast they portray accentuates simon s superb knack at creating comedic conflict this movie is simply one of the ultimate must sees and does demand a rightful prestigious place in the pages of film history
ten out of ten stars it s hard to believe this was a made for television movie just the phrase made of tv makes me shudder the production values for made for tv movies are almost always remarkably lower than production values for professional movie studios that being said this version of the christmas carol should have been released in theaters because it is that good it s my personal favorite of all the christmas carol movies because every aspect of this production are of the highest quality yes there are some minor on screen glitches with two of the ghosts that visit scrooge but there isn t a movie in existence that doesn t have at least a couple of mistakes scott turns in a stellar performance as scrooge he s a pleasure to watch in fact i can t think of one performance in this film that shouldn t be applauded the costuming location shooting and winter backdrop are mesmerizing the musical score is endearing and heart warming add to that solid directing flawless cinematography and faithful scripting we have here what will one day be considered a holiday classic it really hasn t been around long enough to be a classic but mark my words one day soon it will be this film has turned into a yearly christmas tradition in my home because it embodies the true meaning behind christmas love selflessness and giving in as selfish greedy world my family and i can lose ourselves in the christmas carol starring george c scott
this is certainly one of my all time fav episodes of trek there is just so much going on in this one film that its crazy cool first the guys beam down to an alien planet thats about to explode they meet a freaky librarian type dude very well played then kirk manages to get himself transported back to what is very much like th century earth mccoy and spock try to follow but instead nearly freeze to death on the frozen version of the alien world years in the past kirk manages to get himself locked up and charged with witchcraft while spock enjoys some amok time with a sexy cavegirl who was vanquished to the this frozen awful world by some bad guy spock decides hes happy where hes at and gives mccoy a royal assestment whuppin when the doc suggests they need to look for a way out anyhow they all finally escape leaving the poor cavegirl behind it takes a ton of convincing before spock finally gives in and leaves you can literally taste the sadness at the end leaving the cavegirl all alone in her frozen wasteland just seems cruel and is really touching spock must have been out of his vulkin mind to leave behind his greatest hope for love and being human albeit in a not so nice neighborhood anyway you just get so much bang for your buck with this episode a love story the salem witch trials spock as a human the desperation of being left in total isolation abandoned and three entirely different settings on the alien planet its amazing they managed to jam all this into one fifty minute film this one is a classic don t miss it i want it on dvd fer shure vulcans
this second film is just as interesting as the previous one except that there is no suspense we know what he is going to do and what is going to happen before it is even hinted at on the screen then the pleasure comes only from the way the various tricks happen and the succession of them we know there will be dynamite in the car that he will lose a wheel that the car will have a crash just to speak of the car and that is what happens now the details and the particulars are for you to discover them in the film that he may be baited by some dumb woman is obvious and has to come but we know that he has already seen through her and that he knows he is being dragged into a trap now how is he going to get out of it that s what you must discover by yourself and don t worry he will get the main trafficker but how is another story a speed boat is no match to our busy beaver on the river we also know when he is going to be wounded they did not know what bullet proof jackets were in those days it s true recently it was discovered that some gis did not have that kind of equipment in iraq but what is the meaning of such a film this insistence on hunting the traffickers and this blindness that does not see that it is the prohibition that creates the problem but the film is a constant and perfect illustration that there is no value what so ever that can stand in the way of this moralistic crusade against the forces of evil why not simply legalize these goods so that they can be properly observed and under surveillance when something is not illegal or pushed out of the way it is all the less fun to use them to do them it is the forbidden or the restricted that is attractive dr jacques coulardeau university paris dauphine university paris pantheon sorbonne university versailles saint quentin en yvelines
i first saw this movie on some movie channel hbo some time ago i was a fan of public enemy nwa and other early rap and had seen cb in theaters anyway the promo for it caught my eye and i wanted to see what it was all about well right off the bat i knew it was going to be good warning and i was right the parody songs alone make this movie worth watching over and over my peanuts but the overall flow and delivery of the movie was great you ve got to love the satire of rap groups obviously nwa certain rappers eazy e flava flav ice cube and the humor of the three members of nwh who can forget tone deaf scratching with his ass it s too bad this movie didn t get the credit it deserved as it was overshadowed by cb during their releases but in my opinion is a much better film if you know and like s gangster rap you ll be watching and laughing with this movie for a long time if you aren t into or don t like rap you ll enjoy the jokes at the expense of the genre
since it has been some years since i reviewed this classic i have decided to go back and review it more in dept but first some insider notes from a movie critic this animated series is one of those that i grew up with it made my childhood joyful it made it awesome miss some of this stuff today that we clearly don t see as much as we did back in the days well on to the review talespin or luftens helte which it is called in denmark is a great animated series it is much like chip and dale ducktales and a lot of those old ones so it has that weird feeling surrounding it i cannot remember this series as much as i would like to remember it but in my opinion it was very great it came with some kind of message not that wild of a message however it is one of the old ones so that can be forgiven now i don t want to sound old or anything but i feel like time slipped out of my hands with these cartoons today we see something like ed edd and eddy or anything else weird like that we have all these new or nearly new shows like hannah montana or something like that yet i feel like that we don t have the same spirit in cartoons or real shows like we did in the early days now maybe i am wrong but i feel like time has changed to much to conclude i would be thrilled to see these series like talespin being released again to the tv screen instead of all the new ones give me back my childhood cartoons give them to the kids i have some day give them again
every scene was put together perfectly this movie had a wonderful cast and crew i mean how can you have a bad movie with robert downey jr in it none have and ever will exist he has the ability to brighten up any movie with his amazing talent this movie was perfect i saw this movie sitting all alone on a movie shelf in blockbuster and like it was calling out to me i couldn t resist picking it up and bringing it home with me you can call me a sappy romantic but this movie just touched my heart not to mention made me laugh with pleasure at the same time even though it made me cry i admit at the end the whole movie just brightened up my outlook on life thereafter i suggested to my horror action and pure humor movie buff of a brother who absolutely adored this movie this is a movie with a good sense of feeling it could make you laugh out loud touch your heart make you fall in love and enjoy your life every time you purposefully walk past this movie just be aware that you are consciously making the choice to live and feel this inspiring movie who knows what if it could really happen to you and keep your mind open to the mystical wonders of life
i love jack s jokes like the clich is or over the top clich guy black oily skin kinda spooky he is just hilarious daniel s starting to catch up on him to good thing jack s not on the team anymore in a way or else it would have been sarcasm mania i just love all the plots season a little less i have to admit the characters are great the actors are great i m starting to pick up facial expressions and more from jack daniel and teal c it just all theoretically possible and exciting oops their i go again sorry i m also starting to pick up traits from carter and all of this is driving my parents nutz well to conclude i think it s good for another three seasons or so especially if they keep on packing the episodes with all this humor drama action and so forth
i remember seeing promos for this show before it appeared back in i was at the time and now at the age of it feels weird to have seen this cult show start and end and to look back on it the s all of a sudden seem so far away what a great decade anyway i used to watch monstervision all the time as i am a huge fan of monster flicks and horror films it was like the s version of chiller theater if mst k can get dvd s why not joe bob s show at least monstervision was more interesting and informative a lot of joe bob s comments and info on the films were just hilarious most of the movies shown on the show were b or c grade but it showed a lot of a house films as well like the hammer films from england which are top notch as well as many with the stop motion majesty of ray harryhausen many were oddball flicks that you wouldn t see anywhere else like the the japanese sci fi movies besides of course godzilla which is familiar to almost everyone and independent movies like metal storm and motel hell with the new decade of film preservation and more independent minded directors i think monstervision would be a good show for ifc to pick up since they already have a hit with the ifc grind house show i m sure this show will be picked up again for nostalgia reasons some day i guess will have to wait and see until then thats great television
la maman et la putain is the beautifulest film of all time and what s most moving about it may be the relation between reality and art the movie deals with which is directly inspired by proust s a la recherche du temps perdu indeed la maman et la putain and in search of lost time apparently tell the same story the one of the failure of love which repeats itself endlessly the first woman s name is always gilberte and the second woman appears like a twisted and deformed double of gilberte veronika is like a whore gilberte beautiful like the night whereas gilberte was pure and beautiful like the day after the failure of the first love a second love begins but this one is like already doomed by the first one veronika takes the place of gilberte in alexandre s life and in the movie she progressively eclipses her first by time to time gilberte s still coming when alexandre waits for veronika then totally that shows it s the same sad story repeating itself the same unfaithful woman like alexandre says who appears endlessly and unfaithful is for proust the higher point in love which makes it exist but which also underlines its illusions art is what causes the passage between what s outside the illusion of love to what s inside which is the truth and is a learning of this truth for instance when veronika notices the strange way alexandre makes is bed he answers that he saw it in a movie and then that a movie it s made for that to learn how to live how to make a bed alexander wants to live like he was in a film he wants his life to be art this conception of art comes from proust with whom eustache shares the same rejection of political art and realism in art la maman et la putain fights against a conception of art principaly political see for example the ironical review of a political movie by alexandre like proust says art doesn t care for all this proclamations and only exists in silence first of all art is introspection and that also why realism or naturalism is rejected art needs to transform reality to exist proust writes i discover the illusion of realism which is a lie that s why la maman et la putain doesn t hide its artificiality underlines by the way the actors say their text the more you seem artificial the higher you go said eustache eustache and proust both share this idea that the artist is a translater of a inner truth but alexandre failed where eustache succeed la maman et la putain tells us the failure of a character to be what he truly is you can sens the tragedy arise when you go further in the movie which becomes saddest you can see it in the face of alexandre who looks more and more like a living dead you can see it by the fact that the scenes become longer and that after a while nothing happens outside at the end of the movie when you see alexandre writing and veronika asking if he s writing his life you can guess that he s not that even literature failed the end of the movie shows the symbolic death of alexander who is smashes by the heaviness of reality and in this tiny nurse s room alexandre looks more like albertine than marcel to explain this failure we can say that alexandre is a balzac s reader in forme et signification jean rousset explains that in proust s the readers of balzac who are swann and charlus are unable of any artistic creation because they re stuck in reality which they mistake with art they see reality in art and are not aware of the transformations that necessarily exist between the life of an artist and his work between reality and art and that s exactly alexandre he claims for instance that he loves a woman for parallel reasons because she played in a bresson s for example he s like swann who falls in love with odette because she looks like a botticelli s woman life is perhaps not my vocation this thought is indeed by eustache who committed suicide even if it s said by alexandre nevertheless there is a difference between alexandre and eustache if eustache is absolutely alexandre alexandre is like a double without art a horrible vision of the artist which crystallizes his fears by fallowing veronika at the end of the movie alexandre is condemned to illusions it s death that remind me the last frames of the movie in the face of jean pierre l aud as well as in the endless pucking of veronika or maybe it is already hell that describes the end like in sarte s huit clot and absolutely not like in the final liberation of le temps retrouv if eustache had read proust alexandre could never have finish the book always perturbed by life and veronika when he tries to read it at his apartment or in the caf s la maman et la putain is like a inverse double of in search of lost times which tells how alexander doesn t become an artist whereas a la recherche du temps perdu tells how marcel becomes a writer genette if like baudelaire says an artiste tells reality at the light of his dream it is his nightmare that eustache tells us in la maman et la putain
this movie is incredible if you have the chance watch it although a warning you ll cry your eyes out i do every time i see it and i own it and have watched it many times the performances are outstanding it deals with darkness and pain and loss but there is hope this movie made me look at the world differently vicarious experience according to my english teacher also if you ve seen it note the interesting use of shadows and light home room is a phenomenal movie and i rate it for real because of the excellent acting amazing plot and heart wrenching dialogue very tense very moving doesn t give all the answers but makes many good points about humankind
it s not a big film the acting is not amazing some sub charterers are even played badly the film is not beautiful in any sense nothing really inventive or new if you like big films this one is not for you yet it has a big really big plus on the story larry s story works because we know this story from our own lives the girl we didn t ask to a date the test we ve failed the friend we let down are all in our history this movie works because it touch it it s a great story because it s a small one it s the life we all have with regrets we all have and yet the message hits every life we could have lived would have had their downside the first time i watched it i was it was shown in a party at my school years later i keep reflecting on it every once in a while and every time i see it it puts a smile on my face watch it it will do you good you ll be happier with what you have
eddie murphy delirious is undoubtedly the funniest thing i have ever seen in my life when i saw it for the first time about years ago i was in stitches for weeks after it to date i have seen it a further times and i still laugh my ass off each time for those who dont know eddie murphy was a brilliant stand up comedian before he was a hollywood superstar there is not one dull spot in this piece of genius unlike eddie murphy raw which was released in which goes flat during the middle if you are not the sort of person who can t stand swearing then i wouldn t advise you to see it as you will probably hear swearing of some form every seconds i gave this a out of because it displays the greatest comic genius of them all at his best
this movie really is a mixed bag on the one hand the story and concept of the movie are really good tense and have some nice plot twists in it but than again on the other hand it all is told very slow without style and uninvolved still i regard just cause as an above average thriller simply because of the fine cast maybe sean connery was miscast in his role i mean he isn t really that believable as a the main hero and father of a young daughter played by a still very young scarlett johansson by the way and husband of kate capshaw i feel that he simply was too old for the role to be really credible in it however sean connerey is of course a great actor and that is the only reason why he is still able to carry the movie as good as he does but he of course is helped by a very solid supporting cast that consists out of actors like laurence fishburne blair underwood ned beatty hope lange lynne thigpen and ed harris all actors are really good but some of them are highly underused at the same time which is a real shame as well as a missed opportunity especially ed harris is just totally great in his role as a psychopathic serial killer he s truly chilling and acting superbly normally he doesn t play this ruthless chilling sort of roles in movies so he really surprises with his role in this one his performance alone is already more than enough reason to watch this movie however due to the fact that the story is told without much style and too formulaic none of the characters in the movie really work out well because it feels all too distant it really is the way of storytelling that kills all the movie its fine potential arne glimcher directs the movie with little style and keeps the pace too low at times because of this we as viewers never really get involved with the story or any of it s characters it really is too bad for just cause had more than enough potential a fine cast and a slick story with some unexpected twists and turns in it in which nothing is what it seems the cast and story are the only reason why this movie is still an above average thriller that will probably still please the fan of the genre it however is an eternal shame that the movie is lacking in its story telling and style or else this movie could had been a real classic in its genre
this movie was excellent for the following reasons it contained great backdrops and sets it showed the disparity of a war torn environment alongside a technological one john cusack s acting was terrific he portrayed angst very well it showed the vulnerabilities of everyone in a war torn situation it gave us a picture of what might happen in the future in many respects i was also impressed with the acting for the most part hilary s acting was i found the most stilted the morals and values of everyone in a war torn situation are up for grabs the liberal journalist and the conservative business man are capable of doing anything in any situation and are equally unpredictable great stuff psp
a clever undeniably entertaining romp starring peter ustinov as a career embezzler with his sights set on a us conglomerate in london he s abetted by foxy and deceptively sharp maggie smith and threatened with exposure by jealous company man bob newhart this is a heist film with a lot of brains ustinov is exceptional as is smith and newhart is quite funny the real surprise is karl malden as the pill popping executive vice president malden has seldom been so loose cesar romero and robert morley pop up in some funny cameos the excellent music score is by laurie johnson eric till s direction is brisk and the script by ustinov and ira wallach is first rate very smart a swinging good time
i really loved it although while reading the reviews it was quite disturbing to me but as an anime art fan i can totally understand this perfect art work even though some of it was against my cultures and believes but hey it s the world of art the beginning of the film is very strong strange and confusing it s hard to understand the contents which make me respect the one who made it only someone who is extremely opened can do such daring film it s absolutely not for kids even though the characters are cute and adorable but they go through some disturbing adventures that cannot be erased sorry if the spelling is wrong from ones memory
surely one of the mysteries of the modern world this film is not considered to be within the top films of all time if you watched this film and thought it was anything other than wonderful please let me know how al pacino s performance is as good as it gets
compelling and innovative at the beginning of this criminally underrated whoopi goldberg flick the writers draw a parallel between theodore rex and the orson welles classic citizen kane the writers are justified in drawing such a seemingly disparate parallel but the viewing public is too often hoodwinked into seeing overly hyped hollywood schlock to appreciate the subtle similarities between these two movies in citizen kane charles foster kane is feared and admired by his colleagues and his underlings much like whoopi goldberg in this movie this movie is about finding love in everybody s differences it is an epic examination of the fear of abandonment and the need for love and acceptance in a society that is dominated by greed and self absorption whoever paired whoopi goldberg and theodore rex formulated a dyad for the ages with the only justifiable comparisons being bogey and bacall hepburn and tracy and hall and oates if you would love to watch an uplifting celluloid philosophical examination of some of humanity s deepest drives bergman esqe but not as depressing theodore rex should be viewed immediately
i love the movies and own the comics the comics are different then the movie but still i d give it out of it was awesome if the movies got anymore awesome i would have her babies and i am female read the comics you won t regret it yes in this movie since brian p the artist for her died we don t get nearly as good artistic work i mean seriously don t get me wrong these people did great but different versions for different people different strokes for different folks as the saying goes any guy who doesn t go bonkers over her is insane or does not like women or you know just plan insane if i could count on my fingers how in love and how many times i have read the comics i would run out of fingers for sure but hey there is always toes
this movie surprised me in a good way from the box i got the impression that it was an action thriller but it was too funny to be a thriller even though it was somewhat exciting there s a lot of nice one liners and funny situations in this movie and james belushi was born to do bill manucci he does a great job the rest of the cast ain t half bad either and especially timothy dalton is a treat the story can get pretty confusing at times as new characters shows up during the film things get more complicated as nobody seldom tells the truth about things if you don t pay attention things might get a bit messy in the end but i really liked it louis morneau isn t all that well known but he has done a perfectly ok job with this one and i never really grew impatient while watching the movie made men is well worth checking out
spoilers this is only the second pay per view i ve given a perfect the first being the royal rumble it was full of exciting matches that weren t memorable just disposable fun and that s why i love it the opening match between razor and dibiase as well as ludvig borga vs marty jannetty were the only low points they were ok matches but dibiase deserved better in his final pay per view match these days a match like this would have run ins and a bigger climax for razor s first major babyface push and jannetty fresh off a intercontinental title run could have had a better match with borga but i don t think anyone really cared they just needed a borga push on pay per view television irs and the kid were great as were michaels and perfect i wish perfect could have won but michaels lies down for no one notice how right after this he left the wwf so he wouldn t have to job to razor bret hart had two great brawls with doink notice how everyone s best match is against the hit man and then lawler their rivalry was a classic that s why that year s feud of the year was a no brainer how often do you see two legends win feud of the year this late in their careers the steiners heavenly bodies match was one of the best of the year who knew the bodies could hold their own against one of the best teams ever many say that the undertaker giant gonzalez match was a waste of time but i loved it remember what made the old wwf as in pre wwe great was the mix of athleticism and freak show is there a soul out there who didn t like akeem the main event wasn t bad although nowhere near match of the year status they put lex luger over well but made a wise choice in having yokozuna keep the belt he was the first heel since superstar graham to hold the belt for more than two months nowadays heels are champions all the time but from the beginning of the wwwf through the wwf of the s if you blinked you missed a heel title reign as an old school wrestling fan this one and summerslam are my favorites
punctuating the opening credits sequence is a swarthy man having a strange all too real nightmare closing in on its dystopic paris the film begins to follow a woman into a grungy club where she and a slavic bartender convene outside on the deck they toss exclamations at each other to the effect that she owes him more money although she believes she s paid it all another woman obstructs the budding violence only to have a bitter fight with the woman herself the initial woman storms out and she is kidnapped christian volckman s renaissance appears to be another one in an assembly line of recent motion capture animated sci fi noir pictures but in spite of whether or not that is essentially true it tells a neatly arranged classically unraveling detective story that keeps us in the dark in its opening minutes even whilst introducing karas the hard boiled cop we recognize from the beginning as the man awakening from a terrible dream the rudiments of classic film noir are all hit upon without any anachronistic changes for all intents and purposes it is in the harshness of its monochrome that volckman s french thriller has followed no example for the film s animators unfettered by the challenges of physical lighting that would normally be faced have been able to begin with a totally black frame and to affix utter pitch white according to the action on screen as they scrupulously imitate the effects of real light sources throughout the frame the distinction of black and white here is full blown without even any of the slightest shades of gray to tone with the characters less starkly definite moral codes and the outcome is a harsh and judgmental vision of the direction in which commercial civilization is going sporadically caused to undergo the most blaring and ruthless of illumination it is the artistic study of film noir taken to their visual boundary of its philosophy and nothing before has ever shared quite the same execution of this visual concept all the characters in this decent cyberpunk film seem as if to have been walk off with purely from a gothic comic book in black ink but all together their physical responses their motions and the nuances of their facial expressions look ashore within a clear humanity normally films that try out new developments in animation allow their technical advances upstage all other facets of production sin city for example left substance and overall good screen adaptation from its source material to be desired it may not be mind blowing it may have its narrative conventions and its voice over cast may simply be adequate but renaissance made for million over six years not only feels like actual noir instead of a rashly penned appropriation but also is not secondary to all the visual innovation which is played as if to be incidental one leaves thinking not so much about how cool it is when karas is evading bullets shot through a crowded glass parisian street but more about its ponderance of life and death how life s tragedies such as death make life meaningful
the unflappable william powell he is a joy to watch on the screen as he makes his way through situations without a care in the world he always seems on top of his game and shows little care for anyone who doubts him the murders are projects barely human beings i have noticed this is a staple of the whodunnit other than an occasional weeping widow the victims fulfill the function of being the reason the movie exists nothing more there are enough twists and turns to keep things interesting along the way and powell is a master at this there is a lot of political incorrectness especially as it relates to the asian performers this is a little hard to take the cast is great and curtiz s direction is also a consistent asset
i have to admit that tsui hark is one of a kind you can t top a person with a strong style of movie presence a chinese fantasy picture may not be easy to present to an audience the director attempted to bring back the classic fantasy tales of zu mountain and this is what he displayed the new legend of zu has truly improved from the one in from this new millenium update we could see tsui hark s vision of the zu mountains spectacular visual designs amazing action fantasy epic made beautifully well kept me glued through the entire picture great cast with just fine acting it s truly a fun movie to watch but is it too weird now the down side is people will definitely get confused with it s broad story line shortened down into a minute movie plot may not have much relation among characters but by rewatching the movie you ll have a better sense of understanding the characters itself some can complain there isn t too much physical combat besides with characters that have supernatural powers to defeat foes spirits fighting by hand to hand wouldn t really make sense at all i appreciated this nice stylish picture it may have a thin story but hey look at tsui hark s time tide we got confused by the plot as well but it was truly something stylish and awesome tsui hark always attracts something different into h k cinema american audiences may have some difficulty to understand while watching this movie cause this ain t no crouching tiger hidden dragon this is a whole new genre although it may not be a masterpiece but it s special effects is truly better than storm riders this is really worth checking out
this is the first out of the guinea pig series and is one of the more infamous films out of the collection it took me a long time to finally man up and get my hands on a copy of this notorious group of films i bought the guinea pig box set and decided to watch the collection in order by release date so i popped this sucker in and sat down from what i had read on the internet and realizing the content involved in this film i was expecting to test my nerves in full force this ended up not being the case the film focuses on a group of men who kidnap a woman and begin torturing her with the hopes of discovering the human breaking point and how long a human can tolerate pain sounds like one sick flick right wrong the film fails to shock this may be because i have become desensitized over the years do to my obsession with horror but i think it is safe to say that any true gorehound could sit through this with ease on the other hand an individual who does not have a well knowledge of this type of film will most likely be overwhelmed and disgusted by the images they see on the screen though it failed to shock me the film contains some pretty mean spirited and graphic scenes of violence including the ripping out of fingernails intestines thrown at an unconscious woman and a needle through the eye overall i think for majority of the gorehounds on this board that you should just get your hands on a copy of this film for the novelty of it but i suggest that for any new comers to these type of films that you should work your way up to this one
bogmeister and others have pretty much nailed this shore leave is really tos first attempt at lightweight sci fi which they would later perfect with the classic trouble with tribbles it gave both the crew of the enterprise and its tv viewers a needed respite from the universe threatening consequences of for example the corbomite manouever looking for a place to chill out for a while the enterprise happens across a seemingly idyllic m class planet and sends an exploratory team down to take a closer look soon enough all kinds of absurdities begin to take place some seemingly perilous but it all seems a morass of human emotional extremities played out in a weird blend of fantastic mystery mccoy has gone through the looking glass psychological thriller kirk is stalked by an indefatigable bully from his past and romantic comedy no comment tos was the least serialized of all of the series in the trek franchise so it is easy to forget how many episodes in the first season focused on heavy handed potentially calamitous drama unlike later series franchise writers tos production team was not afraid to literally go where no tv series had gone before and shore leave despite its occasional problems is an example my only criticism of this episode is that the cast particularly shatner ironic given his legendary sense of humor didn t seem to know how to handle this new wrinkle on st s themes the last scene is possibly one of the worst scenes i can remember from the entire tos run both compositionally and in terms of acting nuff said my recommendation see it while watching the entire first season as it was meant to be seen it order
i fell in love with emily watson in breaking the waves then grew even more fascinated by her range and adeptness in hilary and jackie now comes this stunning portrayal of a rich girl who spurns breeding and convention in favor of mothering the tortured soul of the child of a man clearly in need of mothering her eyes are the mirror to his soul and what gentle and beautiful eyes they are those who take things literally will find marleen gorris poetic and allegorical direction quite frustrating romantics who are willing to go with the amazing kinetic energy is this filmed allegorical poem will be well rewarded
though this movie is cheesiness at its best it is pulled off perfectly this movie without a doubt has to be considered a modern classic there are basically two kinds of movies i like movies with depth chick flicks if you must i blame my wife for this and mindless comedies where i can sit back and relax this movie is a perfect example of the latter a friend of mine turned me on to this movie shortly after its release considering me to somewhat shallow he said to me you ve got to see this movie it s just your type of movie foregoing the insult i started watching i know they mentioned the ramones a million times but when you actually see them i said hey it is the ramones my friend replied i don t know they were a real band i had my moment of glory this movie though now somewhat dated is a must see for ramones fans or anyone else for that matter
well after long anticipation after seeing a few clips on bravo s the scariest movie moments i had long awaited to see this film the plot was simple beautiful model alison parker cristina raines moves into an apartment building that s a gateway to hell the sentinel is a down right creepy film even if it s a bit slow it s a mix of the omen and rosemary s baby the acting is fine and there are some truly disturbing bits such as the awkward orgy scene with the dead father and the chubby woman in the middle of the orgy eating cake and laughing the ending is a weird mix of deformed people and cannibals it s a very odd campy but in the end i truly believe a great film one of my favorites from the s even if it s nothing greatly original it s wacky and extremely creepy probably one of my all time favorites
markham says urbane gentleman crime solver philo vance william powell to the district attorney i m coming more and more to the belief that archer coe was killed in this room that poker this dagger sheath now these fragments it s all here but vance markham says do you mean to tell me a dead man walked upstairs i m not trying to tell you anything but the facts vance says this is the most remarkable case in my experience we re sympathetic wealthy arrogant archer coe disliked it seems by all who knew him had been found slumped in a chair in his bedroom pistol in his hand and a gunshot wound to his head but wait further examination shows coe had been hit hard by a blunt instrument that fractured his skull then there s the dagger wound in his back complicating matters is that coe s bedroom door and windows all had been locked from the inside coe was no suicide this was murder but how could the killer have escaped what was the specific motivation since there are so many suspects and why was coe s brother brisbane coe found dead in the main floor closet the kennel murder case now years old still provides a stylish look at the old locked room classic whodunit what makes it work as well as it does is first the mystery is complicated and clever but still is logical second is the amusing assured performance of william powell consider his work as philo vance as something as a rehearsal for his great performances as nick charles few things escape vance he uses his wits to piece things together he s also good company powell was a star in the twenties and moved steadily upward in status and popularity when the talkies took over his intelligence style and effortless sophistication have made him one of the most contemporary seeming of actors from the past also pleasant is seeing a few other great faces there s mary astor as hilda lake the young resentful and potentially rich ward of coe paul cavanaugh as a titled brit hovering around hilda helen vinson with her notably sultry and selfish manner watch her really do her stuff in vogues of etienne giraudot a small elderly man as the fussy dr doremus whose job as coroner and medical examiner keeps taking him away from his meals and ralph morgan as archer coe s private secretary this movie has a high percentage of middle aged men without an ounce of fat who can wear snug english cut tailored suits with ease most of all is eugene palette with his noble belly and gravel voice as detective sergeant heath sergeant heath and vance are long time acquaintances who actually seem to like each other
this low budget erotic thriller that has some good points but a lot more bad one the plot revolves around a female lawyer trying to clear her lover who is accused of murdering his wife being a soft core film that entails her going undercover at a strip club and having sex with possible suspects as plots go for this type of genre not to bad the script is okay and the story makes enough sense for someone up at am watching this not to notice too many plot holes but everything else in the film seems cheap the lead actors aren t that bad but pretty much all the supporting ones are unbelievably bad one girl seems like she is drunk and or high the cinematography is badly lit with everything looking grainy and ugly the sound is so terrible that you can barely hear what people are saying the worst thing in this movie is the reason you re watching it the sex the reason people watch these things is for hot sex scenes featuring really hot girls in red shoe diary situations the sex scenes aren t hot they re sleazy shot in that porno style where everything is just a master shot of two people going at it the woman also look like they are refuges from a porn shoot i m not trying to be rude or mean here but they all have that breast implants and a burned out weathered look even the title deviant obsession sounds like a hardcore flick not that i don t have anything against porn in fact i love it but i want my soft core and my hard core separate what ever happened to actresses like shannon tweed jacqueline lovell shannon whirry and kim dawson women that could act and who would totally arouse you and what happened to b erotic thrillers like body chemistry nighteyes and even stripped to kill sure none of these where masterpieces but at least they felt like movies plus they were pushing the envelope going beyond hollywood s relatively prude stance on sex sexual obsessions and perversions now they just make hard core films without the hard core sex
as a young teenager at the time airwolf was compulsory viewing for a generation who wanted their cowboys and indians to have amazing gadgets and whizz bang explosions in many ways the show was essentially knight rider in the skies similar comic book technology a central character who was essentially a loner and echoing the concept of one man making a difference but in other important ways it was thematically very different from knight rider street hawk the a team and other action shows of the time for one thing the premise of the series is built not on a desire to help those in need but by stringfellow hawke s possession of airwolf for essentially selfish reasons as leverage to try to find his mia brother st john and then there is the dark edge provided by basing the series firmly in an s cold war context complete with soviet espionage and central american dictators not to mention the enemy within sure the a team constantly referred back to vietnam and the team s status as fugitives but it was generally done with a light touch and was rarely central to the plot itself with airwolf the intrigue was key to the tone and direction of the show although this was ill advisedly diluted as the series went on with hindsight the cold war setting clearly dates the series many of the stories are creaky and contrived and much of what airwolf does is clearly implausible even with today s technology but that s really not the point airwolf was rip roaring fun it tried to tell interesting stories without relying solely on the big action sequences and it didn t sugar coat everything by miraculously ensuring nobody died sometimes it failed but often it succeeded admirably and on a tv budget to boot for uk readers dmax sky channel have just started jan daily re runs of airwolf set your sky box for this blast from the past we may even get the re tooled re cast and sadly vastly inferior fourth season which to my knowledge has never previously been shown in the uk
tarzan and his mate the second of mgm s tarzan pictures picks up a year after the events of tarzan the ape man tarzan and jane have been living happily in the jungle and harry holt one of the expeditioners in the first film returns this time accompanied by the less than honorable martin arlington in quest of the ivory from the elephants graveyard naturally a variety of perilous and exciting adventures take place along the way the first film romanticized everything the jungle adventure romance itself wild animals and even death the second film still has a great deal of romanticism and a lot of wonderful action sequences but a more serious tone underlies the action the characters dare to ask questions like what if something happened to tarzan what would jane do if she was stranded by herself in the middle of the jungle and she had to fend for herself while these are probably the questions real people would be asking in this situation it creates a certain amount of somberness that isn t always as much fun as the throw caution to the wind attitude of the original one of the most enjoyable aspects of this film is the growth we see in tarzan and jane s relationship tarzan still speaks very broken english but he has clearly learned a few new words from his mate additionally their love for each other has really blossomed and we feel like they really have spent a year together in the jungle most people consider tarzan and his mate superior to the original tarzan the ape man personally i liked the first film just a little bit better the main reason is that the relationship between the harry holt martin arlington team isn t nearly as likable as holt s relationship with james parker jane s father from the original the mr arlington character could have worked as a great movie villain but he plays the hero for far too much of the movie the movie can never decide whether we should like him or hate him also i don t want to give anything away but in one of the scenes where we should clearly hate him jane never finds out about those events so the ending isn t quite as satisfying as it could have been all of these detractors are relatively minor however and it s still a great movie like the first film tarzan and his mate has amazing action scenes wonderful wildlife footage and one of the screen s all time greatest romances if you liked the first film in the series this is definitely a sequel to see
a river runs through it is based on the true story of two fly fishing brothers norman and paul brad pitt and craig sheffer whose reverend father tom skerritt is a strict man whose two passions are his faith and fly fishing and for him and his sons there is a fine line between the two this story describes the slow progression of the brothers lives and how their lives separate on two different paths it is a touching movie narrated by the director robert redford playing the elderly norman and reflecting on times long gone and people long dead certain themes recur in the movie such as memory death eternity and dreams most of these themes revolve around the almost tragic hero of paul he is a capable charming and brave man but has his fatal flaws the closing lines sum up the point of the movie then in the arctic half light of the canyon all existence fades to a being with my soul and memories and the sounds of the big blackfoot river and a four count rhythm and the hope that a fish will rise eventually all things merge into one and a river runs through it the river was cut by the world s great flood and runs over rocks from the basement of time on some of those rocks are timeless raindrops under the rocks are the words and some of the words are theirs i am haunted by waters
rawhide was a wonderful tv western series focusing on a band of trail drovers lead by the trail boss gil favor most episodes especially from the first seasons were really character studies of favor and his men guest stars came and went but unlike wagon train they seldom dominated the episodes they appeared in rawhide was a true gritty western and gil favor stood out as a memorable character never to be forgotten thanks to eric fleming s performance the show became a massive hit of course he was ably supported by a wonderful cast of good actors clint eastwood sheb wooley paul brinegar steve raines james murdoch rocky shahan robert cabal all of these actors left their mark in a piece of television history rawhide captured the flavour of that time of the west that no other series has for me as yet anyhow managed to do so later seasons tended to split the leads and give them individual story lines for me some of the time this didn t work the cattle drive and the regulars provided the best stories however there were still some classic stories and rawhide remained top drawer affair the black and white photography added to a bleak realistic feel that other western series seldom managed to capture rustlers indians commancheroes beautiful damsels in distress serial killers they all showed up to give our heroes problems the end came for the series quietly when the final season was axed less than half way through the reason eric fleming had departed and rawhide was now a head without a body the gritty realism was gone gil favor commanded respect and exuded authority he was never infallible and this made him all the more interesting we shall not see his like again watch an episode whenever you can they seldom disappoint
this was a favorite christmas special that i wish that they would release on vhs or dvd since my rpm got lost and any cassettes i made are also long gone i am not even a big john denver fan but was very impressed with the music which was mostly traditional favorites with a muppet spin esp little st nick it also contained a few little known songs original even though it was done at the end of the s this show had a timeless feel to it hoping to find a copy soon
it appears that there s no middle ground on this movie most of it takes place in a dream and like most dreams it s often foolish and illogical it s also a gorgeous production with some great songs and fine performances especially by our angel jeanette s deadpan unknowing insults and various other faux pas at the dream reception are hilarious and her jitterbug with binnie barnes is a surprise and a delight at one point she gets to sing a snippet from carmen followed by the final trio of faust holding a lapdog for some strange reason then aloha oe on the beach it s a surreal comedy tremendously entertaining if you can get into the groove
as an anti football person i on the surface grudgingly took my younger brother to see this film although secretly i hoped it might be east is east ii the trailers looked fun so i thought i d give it a go it took about ten minutes but after that i was glued to the screen and that wasn t anything to do with the neck cramp caused by sitting too near the front due to a packed auditorium the acting was fresh and vibrant the characters engaging and the jokes genuinely funny the entire auditorium was laughing out loud every minute or so football fan or no football fan sport became irrelevant to the main principles of love friendship family independence and rivalry add a dash of sikh culture and you have the formula for the best british comedy i ve seen in a long time dare i say it better than east is east this film trots along nicely at a lovely pace never dwelling on anything longer than necessary nor leaving anything unfinished keeping the viewer entertained and mentally engaged though not a characteristically twisting and turning film there are some pleasant surprises on the way and things don t always happen as you would expect saying that there were elements of predictability but these were exploited satirically more than used as script fillers i suppose depending on your particular penchant for happy endings you could be either delighted let down by the ending personally if there was any other outcome i would have written a strongly worded letter to the script writers as for the actors i would have to say that juliet stevenson paula put in the finest performance i never knew that people like that existed but she her realism with sometimes bizarre concepts has convinced me that they possibly do prize for the most unconvincing of the main characters goes unfortunately to kiera knightley jules but don t get me wrong even she offered a great performance it s just that someone has to be last of the best and sorry kiera this time you re it tip don t leave before the credits once the lights came back up i realised to my horror that perhaps i shouldn t have watched this film after all my beloved but forgotten ice junkie had melted into a sugary blue juice oh what am i saying it was absolutely brill and i can t recommend it enough i will definitely buy it when it comes out and add it to my collection of videos i m a student i only splash out if it s really worth it
this tender beautifully crafted production delved deep down bitter sweet into my being the irreverent pupils the life embittered bus driver and the teachers personalities present a subliminal debate as the story unveils the adult characters all seem familiar my teachers my bus driver each one of their opinions so plausible and well known when a key incident happens on the bus we are sent on a circuit of viewpoints all the time the babble of teenage energy is only just kept under control by the organisers of the trip mr harvey is experiencing much pain throughout he reminds me of war damaged teachers i did not understand when i was an irreverent pupil rhidian brook and the producers deserve much acclaim for this well shaped british film the acting unblemished the scenes appropriate it should be widely available yet does not seem to have been given the right opportunity
years since this show was made and it is still is the best show ever made the writing was st class and the production second to none this show would never be made today and that this a shame i hope if you are thinking about finding this show to watch that you do ag came out the year i left high school at the time my fav tv show was the x files this gives you an idea of why i first got into this show ag was a far better program with better writing but only got one reason i know this is not the only program to only get one season another example that comes to mind would be the lone gunman x files spin off it had good writing and was funny but also only got one season it does not seem right we also have to remember that this show was around before shows like twilight made dark shows cool so i think this may have also let to the show going down hill watch this program and enjoy it out of for me

new york i love you just like its predecessor paris je t aime is a compound of various stories that reflects the different kinds and aspects of love but unlike it the rhythm is much faster and the stories much shorter the movie offers a unique view of the city of new york with its various and different landscapes new york i love you offers a first class cast featuring such great actors like shia labeouf natalie portman ian mckellen hayden christensen chistina rcci and orlando bloom ethan hawke james caan and robin wright penn among others and some excellent writers and directors like brett ratner and anthony mingella

citizen x tells the story of the butcher of rostov nickname for a heinous and perverse russian serial killer who claimed lives from the film focuses on the novice detective rea who doggedly pursued the killer against all odds in the face of an uncooperative bureaucracy in self serving and convenient denial an hbo product for t v the film offers a solid cast good performances spares the audience much of the grisly details but plays out like a docudrama sans the stylistics of similar hollywood fare an even and straight forward dramatization of a serious and comparatively little known story more interesting than jack the ripper b
this movie is really genuine and random it s really hard to find movies like it in bunches of movies now in hollywood i really enjoy watching this movie i bought its dvd tuesday this week and i ve watched it for times i love the spanglish accent of paz it s just really cute as she is and her acting and morgan s are so funny and natural my movie taste might be really different from others but i have to say i really love this movie the simple is the best i ve learned something more about life from this movie well or at least usa s life life is really random sometimes u meet someone they pass by your life and be your friends coincidently and u don t spend so much time with them maybe just a while but u enjoy that while with them and then u and them will never meet each other again but the time u are together is really unforgettable just keep those moments in your mind as grateful and nice memories this movie might be cheap in the making price but its meanings are totally not cheap i rarely can learn anything from movies but this is an exception
i for one have shamelessly enjoyed every episode of pushing daisies this season and hope that the writers strike won t brutally end the beginnings of a very good show ned is a pie maker who owns a restaurant in the middle of town and has a secret talent emmerson is a private investigator with his own unique quirks like his love of knitting charlotte chuck is the once dead but not anymore childhood friend and sunny spot of ned s life olive is the jealous but good hearted waitress oh and add the dog jim dale brings all the characters together with his wonderful narration of the show chuck ned and emmerson along with olive and occasionally the dog solve multiple murder mysteries with the assistance of ned s special gift of bringing dead people back to life the show is funny clean and romantic in a very cute and good hearted way and i d recommend it to anyone
fortunately for us real mccoy fans most likely all baby boomers who grew up in the late s and s three of the adult actors actress appeared when they did for the reunion show in tony martinez and richard crenna both died shortly thereafter as enjoyable as it was to see luke sugar babe and pepino together again it was equally mysterious about the complete absence of any mention of lydia reed and michael winkleman it is my understanding that little luke had passed away in but i m not sure how there is no information about hassie on the internet that i can find very curious why they were not even mentioned it was so conspicuous their absence from the reunion show that i suspect that the family of michael and lydia herself if still alive either requested to be left out of the discussion and therefore their desire was granted or tnn could not find any trace of either michael or lydia like the rest of us they seemed to have vanished therefore it would be the safest policy to leave them out of the conversation all together otherwise the retrospect on walter brennen was wonderfully done they made no bones about it it was grandpa who made the show such a success i remember as a child mimicking grandpa s gimp walk and my parents laughing as i m sure a million other children did back then one annoyance that did bother me a bit was the tendency for richard crenna to dominate the discussion at times interrupting tony and kathleen to make a point in fact although tony martinez seemed completely capable to contribute to the conversation he was not allowed to speak out and say too much during the reunion show unfortunate since i wanted to hear from all three equally all in all the reunion show was a real treat for me i ve watched it on dvd several times and have enjoyed it each time dodgerdude
i thought the movie was extremely funny and actually very interesting it was raw and honest and felt as if i was really watching the real people not actors it s great entertainment it also painted the people as human on our level not below us it is a very good film
this is one of the best movie i have ever seen my parents comes from rural india and to some extend i have seen the life of the villagers peoples are really poor and have financial and social problems the movie just reflects exactly the same full credit to the director and the actor they have done an excellent job i just wonder how can movies like lagaan and paheli can go for oscar and not doghi i don t understand the criteria on which the movies are selected is the money that makes the difference or having some big names in the movie makes the difference hope to see more movies like this in the future
i can t say too much about kalifornia as sadly i have yet to actually see the whole thing i ve only managed to see it in bits and pieces on fuse but what i have seen is absolutely awesome i am a fan of brad pitt but i admit not all his earlier movies are well good but this role i just his acting is great his character early seems so normal well okay creepy dark weird but you know normal for a hillbilly of that type i guess and juliette lewis s performance although i can see how some may be annoyed by it i think it s amazing sadly i have yet to see the end but from reading other reviews on here it sounds good but disappointing i have to admit that i wish david duchovany s sorry if the spelling on that is incorrect was a bit flat but for him it was okay his wife s character was better and i thought her performance while not the best in the movie was pretty good a portrait of the avant gard older sister type particularly the scene where early and brian go to play pool and adele and carrie are having their one on one time together i ve watched that scene at least twice now and i still think the acting in it is just wonderful one because of the emotion that adele portrays after talking about being raped by the three guys and how she feels about early and carrie s reaction to it everything about that i think is just so perfect i mean maybe it s because i can relate a bit i m not sure as for brad pitt who plays the serial killer that we actually get to see for once i thought he was great some movies with pitt that i ve seen were just average or not worth seeing i don t think i ve ever seen a terrible pitt movie or if i have it s not because of his acting it s other factors this movie was not one of them he turned out a great performance in kalifornia i swear i m not just some random i do like him for his acting not just because he s good looking i mean his character in this movie isn t exactly handsome or cute by any means pitt is dark brooding and downright scary at times yet he s also cheerful funny nice and even loving towards adele granted there are some spots that made me want to reach through the tv and strangle him but that s probably just me and the character pitt played in the movie but it also shows how good pitt s acting was in this movie it made me forget that he was playing a character that is what good acting is supposed to do at any rate i wish i could say more but that s all i can really say without having seen the ending i have seen most of the movie through what i ve caught on fuse and as i m writing this i m taping it on dvr so hopefully i can write a more complete review later i just wanted to share my thoughts on a movie that i thought was something really cool and something that seems to have gotten overlooked it shouldn t have
along with darkwing duck this is unfairly cancelled disney has been in decline since tarzan and we need a show like this to get disney back on track ed gilbert and jim cummings were perfect for the voices of louis and baloo sounds familiar the theme theme tune is also catchy out of all the villains which are all great on their own merits tony jay stands out as shere kahn louis and baloo actually sound very similar to the voice overs in the jungle book which isn t a bad thing at all as a matter of fact it s quite inspirational the animation was spot on and the script had plenty of wit that has been severely lacking in animations for years please bring this show back bethany cox
the performance by om puri smita patil and sadashiv amrapurkar and the whole chemistry comes off nicely along with the minimalist approach to story telling and direction by govind nihlani the dialogues by vijay tendulkar is also great i have not seen another movie like this it is one whole each piece so nicely fit in the plot you cannot not be impressed by this movie amrish puri comes off as the bossy husband and baap of om puri om puri is the young man caught between his sense of duty and his inability to fight the system sadhashiv as rama shetty gives just about the right touch to the movie with his smiling and soft speaking villain the first meeting of anand velankar with rama shetty s at sadhashiv s place is absoulely stunning smita patil does not play a main role but her part is also not distracting from the main plot and to add to this all kafi inamdar plays the role of a cop who has come to terms with the system and its workings saying right things in the right places and knowing how to keep himself away from trouble he is also the guru of om puri and helps him whenever he gets into trouble the movie not only brings to focus the difficulties faced by a police officer trying to do his duty but also the other side of brutalities in police custody om puri captures hopelessness and the burning desire to break free in this exceptional performance in ardh satya a treat to all avid fans of indian cinema
i recently purchased the complete american gothic series on dvd and it lived up to my memories of it i was very grateful to be able to view for the first time episodes that were never televised i loved ring of fire in particular of the stories i hadn t seen the first time around gary cole is fantastic as evil sexy lucas buck lucas black as caleb is also a superb player i thought brenda bakke as selena coombs was also superb in her portrayal in fact the whole cast was fantastically talented and had great chemistry with each other it s a shame the series was screwed by the network in collusion with a burgeoning group of censors because it was truly designed for adult viewing a mixture of comedy tragedy farce satire gothic romance and horror genres it offered brilliant characterizations supported by acting at the genius level i had the most tremendous lust for the devil for once in my life long live gary cole sheriff lucas buck the most luscious fallen angel ever
like many of you i am a great fan of the real thing the s noir films but red rock west was a real treat for all of us longing for the past the term neo noir has been so often used inappropriately in the last ten years that it has lost its meaning and its impact john dahl s film on the other hand truly deserved to be described as such the casting is perfect all around and would have felt right at home with tay garnett or jacques tourneur the plot is so tight that you are hooked within the first fifteen minutes james m cain would have appreciated it many contemporary films leave me wondering why they don t make them like they used to and i m not even that old movies such as red rock west give us hope for the future while paying tribute to the past
tsui hark s visual artistry is at its peek in this movie unfortunately the terrible acting by ekin cheng and especially cecilia cheung i felt the urge to strangle her while watching this it s that bad made it difficult to watch at times this movie is a real breakthrough in the visual department when i first saw this my jaw dropped repeatedly and i thought to myself that i ve never seen anything remotely like it but this is how it should be done in order to do full justice to the mythical world of chinese historical kung fu novels without a doubt this is one of the best looking chinese historical kung fu epic ever made but alas tsui hark hasn t improved much in the writing department and the story and dialog are rather juvenile his apparent obsession with the silly and overly long depiction of the evil guys didn t help either to make it worse this movie is very badly cast they decided to use the hot popular hong kong idols as lead characters but unfortunately both ekin cheng and especially cecilia cheung are totally unsuited for historical kung fu dramas because they lack the nobility and mystique that such characters are supposed to embody adam cheng siu chow and brigitte lin in the version are infinitely better i wish that someday zhang yi mou and tsui hark can join forces and produce a movie that has the visual artistry of tsui but with the maturity and story telling poetry of zhang
a female executioner played by the sexy jennifer thomas ii has the fun job of fulfilling all the fantasies of all the men on death row before they meet their maker and what a way to go lucky this film is not real or we would have a lot more people in this world on death row it starts out real slow low light and bad acting like most b films it gets better as it moves along and ends with a bang i would rate it very high on the low cost very sexy movies of the s it s a must see once the kids are away or in bed
this movie is best described or compare to big fish the movie by tim burton but it s a less glamorous and more in you face tale and of course here it s not the father but his grandfather who tells the stories the movie s narrative also moves back and forth so the story outline here at imdb might tell you more than you would like to read before watching the movie it s funny and engaging enough even though you get from one story to another and have some dramatic moments too it also surprises you here and there with things you wouldn t expect a nice little movie then that deserves your attention especially if you like movies like that o
this has by far been one of the most beautiful portraits of a person that i ve ever seen on screen andy goldsworthy is a kind of man that is upon extinction he views the earth and nature with such admiration and respect that it s primitive in a good sense his purity honesty and kindness breathes clearly as you watch him work in such simplistic yet full of life momentary pieces of art i was amazed how patiently he created his pieces and how patiently he accepted their end sometimes prematurely but his scottish sense of humor covers his disappointments brilliantly the film is shoot elegantly and contains the same flow that goldsworthy s art has it combines nature and art in a minimal way as it is in itself fred frith s score is organic enough that it blends everything together without interfering with it naturalistic sound this is overall a great piece of work in every aspect it has no boundaries as far as age goes
a thin story with many fine shots eyecatchers here are the three ladies from the d r e a m team and to a lesser extent the guy accompanying them traci lords convincingly acts out the female half of an evil business couple intending to poison the world with antrax original in this movie is the bra bomb put on a captured member of the d r e a m team of course she is rescued by a co member three seconds before explosion although clearly lent from james bond s goldfinger and you only live twice such a climax always works well all in all a nice watch james bond replaced here by three charlie s angels
the film largely focuses on a bullying robert taylor as a ruthless buffalo hunter and the people who have to put up with him set amidst a hunt for dwindling numbers of buffalo it portrays the end of a tragic era of senseless slaughter and is full of drama and remorse for both the buffalo and the native americans taylor is blinded by his hatred of indians and his naivete that the buffalo herds will never disappear in one scene he shoots animal after animal while in another he murders indians and then eats the food they had cooking on their fire under this ruthless exterior lies an insecure person who is reduced to begging his comrades stewart granger lloyd nolan and russ tamblyn not to leave him it s not the most pleasant of films and is weighed down by the drama it creates leading to a dismal and very fitting conclusion in a blizzard
as a producer of indie movies and a harsh critic of such i have to say i loved this movie it is funny and intelligent well directed and entertaining hats off to the producers and directors for making a good one i ll be watching for the next one i gave it a
i remember casper comic books but don t remember any cartoons maybe they weren t memorable i don t know but at my advanced age here i am watching this very early casper animated short yesterday afterward i was shocked to read the user comments here did people miss the ending i have to learn all over again that casper isn t like the other ghosts who like to go out each night and scare the c p out of everyone he sees no future in that according to the narrator here instead one night he goes out to the rural section of town inadvertently scares some animals and can t find any friends it brings him to tears until a little fox hears him bawling and befriends him the two become buddies but soon the fox is running for his life with a fox hunt in progress other reviews have all mentioned what happens so i ll touch on that too the fox is killed by hunting dogs not shown and casper is in tears for losing the only friend i ever had but nobody mentions the happy ending to this story ferdie the fox becomes a spirit figure like casper jumps on his lap licks his face and the narrator comments they lived happily ever after both characters look overjoyed what is so sad about that this is a nice story with a nice happy ending
bela made pics for monogram but it was only at this one the th that things started to come together all the rest in the series would use this one as the essential template for production writing and character development from here on better or worse the series would also deal with one essential theme a scientist usually bela makes experiments in the basement or the old house sometimes in the basement in the old house that causes things to go blooey this was also the first time that art director dave milton got a chance to spread his wings he came on board for black dragons the flick before but this one is where he gets to make his craft start to click lewis made great atmosphere for next to nothing and was around for all the rest of the monograms casting is key in these and it s a pretty good one b movie wise here you get barclay and harlen also from black dragons along with russell who would star in lewtons cat people movies and rosetto from spooks run wild a nice slice of poverty row talent if you have limited time and budget start with this one it sums up everything they had learned up to this point and gives you something to compare the rest to the plot bela steals gland juice to keep his nasty wife young they both like to sleep in coffins if you can read that and smile the rest will be easy
i loved this movie it s truly bizarre extremely funny morbid witty it makes no sense to tell about the contents of the movie because then i d be giving out the outcome you have to see it without knowing what is it about everything is connected and has its why because it starts subtly and then the things start rolling faster and faster until they culminate in the most insane outburst you can imagine it s even more fun to watch the movie the second time once you know all the tricks the actors are excellent especially ivan trojan whose final scenes are a real master piece i highly recommend this film it s one of the most original ones i ve ever seen
wow this movie was absolutely brilliant i really don t know why everyone says it has a slow pace i thought the pace was perfect the movie is about michael sullivan played by tom hanks with perfection who is a sort of hit man killer working for john rooney paul newman he disslikes this job but does it because rooney payed for his house and helps him financially he had nothing and mr rooney gave him everything but his children are unaware that this is his job and when one witnesses a cold blooded murder by him he is placed in an awkward position and when an atrocity occurs he leaves with his son and is bent on revenge they rob abanks and much more and build a bond they re the perfect team hanks does a great job as always as well as jude law who plays his creepy role to perfection this drama is highly recommended as it shows a beautiful story and greatly shows how the s were
i gotta say clive barker s undying is by far the best horror game to have ever been made i ve played resident evil silent hill and the evil dead and castlevania games but none of them have captured the pure glee with which this game tackles its horrific elements barker is good at what he does which is attach the horror to our world and it shows as his hand is clearly everywhere in this game heck even his voice is in the game as one of the main characters full of lush visuals and enough atmosphere to shake a stick at undying is the game to beat in my books as the best horror title i just wish that this had made it to a console system but alas poor pc sales nipped that one in the bud
after empire strikes back return of the jedi is my second favorite movie from the star wars series luke went to tattoine to save han solo from jabba at the same time the galactic empire is doing in secret the construction of a new space station like the previous death star if this station stays totally constructed it will be the end of the rebel alliance both vader and the emperor are impatient because of the delay of the new death star and they need to kill many of their commanders to have the project made in schedule r and c po are inside jabba s palace to send a message from luke to jabba where lukes pretends to negotiate han s life he gives r and c po as a gift to jabba as part of his plan jabba does not accept the negotiation since he is using han solo as a piece of his palace s decoration han still is frozen in carbonite lando is hidden as jabba s guard and chewbacca is also gave to jabba by a reward hunter when the same hunter tries to save han solo and makes him stay in human form again we see that is actually princess leia in a disguise the problem is that jabba discovers leia s plan and takes her as his slave while han is thrown away in chewbacca s cell luke comes as a jedi knight to rescue his friends at his first try to kill jabba he falls into jabba s monster cell bantha but easily kills it jabba stays angry and decides to thrown han chewbacca and luke to sarlacc a big creature from the desert who stays years digesting it s food luke han and chewie has success in scape again and even boba fett dies when han accidentally throws him in to sarlacc s mouth leia kills jabba and goes after han luke and chewie as well c po and r everybody s safe again luke decides to go to dagoba to complete his training as a jedi as well his promise to yoda the problem is that yoda is too old and sick since he already has years old and before he dies yoda says to luke that he does not need more training but to really be a jedi he must fight with vader again he confirms to luke that vader is luke s dad and that there is another skywalker besides luke in his last moments yoda asks to luke to remember his advices about the temptation of the dark side and to luke transmit his jedi knowledge to other people when yoda dies obi wan s spirit shows up to luke and tells him that luke s father killed his good side anakin to become darth vader and also that he is more machine than a man since he became a sith luke stays worried about killing his own dad and says that he feels that his father still has kindness obi wan tells luke that his twin sister is leia and says the reasons why luke and leia were separated since babies he gives his last advice to luke saying that if he refuses to kill vader the emperor will win the war at the same time the emperor says to vader that he must give luke to him when he shows up since luke is stronger than before and they both needs to combine their efforts to bring luke to the dark side now we are going to have one of the best battles from the star war series when the rebel alliance plans to attack the new space station the death star luke will confront vader and the emperor and leia han and chewie needs to turn off the death star power field with the help of the ewoks little creatures who looks little bears this is for sure one of the most exciting star wars of all

who doesn t have unresolved issues with parents and which parents don t have unresolved issues with each other i know that sounds heavy but this is played for laughs in the movie making both the comedy better and the drama better i ve always like paul reiser and peter falk and although i was a bit concerned that their star qualities might be too big for a small movie i was enchanted from the very first scene especially entertaining were the discoveries that the son makes about his father as a person and peter falk s monologue about being a hard working sacrificing father and husband was the perfect balancing point without that scene being acted so well the movie would have seemed far less nuanced and the character far less interesting nicely done paul and peter
ahh talespin what can i say that hasn t already been said about this great show nothing this is without a doubt one of the most well written shows i ve ever encountered live action or animation the newer stuff is way too dumbed down for my tastes and some of the mature stuff i have to shoo kids out of the room for but not talespin the stories are engaging and very plausible some of them could even be stretched out to an hour or two for a movie episodes like stormy weather and her chance to dream are very dramatic while still being enjoyable for kids and adults alike then there are the pure comedy episodes such as the bluest of the baloo bloods and stuck on you where the emphasis is on hilarity i can laugh myself to tears in a few choice ones the drama aspect is very lacking in most shows nowadays at least those which aren t specifically geared toward it especially in cartoons in the episode stormy weather for instance kit cloudkicker decides that he s going to join an air circus but baloo believes that it would be too dangerous in the biggest fight of the episode baloo yells at kit to stay away from daring dan to which kit screams no you can t tell me what to do your re not my dad and buries his face in his pillow the next day he leaves for the air circus this kind of drama is a rarity in a cartoon and would be most welcome in the ones created nowadays the characters have a lot of depth to them baloo is pretty much the way he is in the jungle book plus or minus a few degrees of laziness rebecca is a cunning business woman whose ideas on getting money while good in theory are seldom good in practice molly is a cute little girl but you can t let that deceive you she can be a real hellion sometimes kit cloudkicker is a darker character than the rest he doesn t trust adults much unless they appeal to him and he has a tendency to break off relationships watch his expression in plunder and lightning when he grabs the grappling hook he looks as though he s prepared to put it right through a pirate in the end it s the drama combined with the very real chemistry between the characters that makes this show in my book the relationship between baloo and kit is very real almost father and son this is demonstrated well in all s whale that ends whale when baloo takes kit s word for it that seymour is abusing the animals in his aquarium instead of siding with the other adults baloo and becky s relationship is also realistic due to baloo s motivation for working comes from wanting to buy back the ol sea duck not necessarily a desire to help rebecca but something tells me that if he did get the duck back he d still do jobs for rebecca the sea duck not to mention all the other planes in the series is pretty realistically designed the plane s functions don t change once throughout the series continuity like that is hard to come by also and unlike most other super planes of other cartoons it doesn t have one single weapon on board unless you count mangoes and relies instead on it s cunning pilot s great skill to get out of trouble it s hard to think of a hero vehicle that doesn t have some sort of gun turret laser cannon or even a handgun somewhere on board and the fact that they use their heads to get out of trouble is so hard to find in a cartoon nowadays plus it s just such a darn cool design this is definitely the best cartoon ever period definitely worth all ten stars
also known as water lilies this film tells the story of two girls as they struggle their way into the world of love and sex this story is told at a slow pace and that works very well it gives plenty of time and space to get to know the different characters and to grow somewhat attached to them using a small cast puts some extra pressure on the people playing as they all have some more screen time than normal but the people playing in this film handle that well everyone is completely believable visual setting is great especially the underwater shots in the swimming pool add a nice effect many films have been made about the same subject though and this one does not really stand out above any of them it pulls some standard pressure methods out of the high hat and works on them it isn t bad not at all but it surely isn t great either and i do feel it could have done better if it had taken some what less explored angles out of synchronous swimmers
as someone else commented this is a feel good movie it s got glorious scenery and the wonder filled voice of luciano i ve seen this movie many times and just saw it again this afternoon i d forgotten how much i miss pavarotti s singing of nessun dorma and i need to get out the cd it s a great movie to just while away the afternoon engrossed in fun and reverie eddie albert is grand as the agent and a bit over the top but all agents are just that anyway the italian countryside is gorgeous but nothing tops the balloon ride for the perfect view if you need acting of olivier proportion this movie isn t for you if you just want a flight of fancy and some wonderful music watch this film just enjoy
i found still crazy to be marvelously entertaining and not only to those of us who lived through that raucous era of late s early s rock my year old daughter watches it with me every time i drag out the dvd don t worry it s only been three times and she loves it too it is a truly loving poignant and hilarious nod to the era and every actor hits his her notes with perfection it was my first introduction to bill nighy and i am glad his somewhat similar turn in love actually brought him more attention bruce robinson was incredible as brian bringing real life to what could have been a caricature of the drug damaged rocker stereotype it was interesting to see that robinson has made quite a name for himself as a writer i live in sherman oaks california and after the first time i saw the movie i bumped into billy connolly at the local mall he lived here at the time and told him it was one of my five favorite films of all time he invited me to sit down at the food court with him and we discussed the movie for some time we even talked of the idea of an american oriented remake before wisely dismissing that why mess with the original my only problem with still crazy is that it wasn t hugely popular in theaters and too many people have missed out on a wonderful experience
a special day ettore scola italy canada every once in a while you come across a film that really touches a nerve this one offers a very simple premise almost flawlessly executed in every way and incredibly moving at the same time it s surprising ettore scola s una giornate particulare is relatively unheralded even hated by some critics time out calls it rubbish and leonard maltin somewhat milder pleasant but trifling i disagree not only because this film is deeply moving but within its simple story it shows us more insights about daily life in fascist italy than most films i ve seen the cinematography is distinctly unflashy even a bit bland and the storyline straightforward which might explain the film s relative unpopularity considering late s audiences weren t exactly spoiled with great italian films it s even stranger this one didn t really catch on with the critics the film begins with a ten minute collage of archive footage from hitler s visit to italy on may th set against this background we first meet antonietta loren a lonely love ridden housewife with six children in a roman apartment building one day when her beo escapes she meets her neighbour gabriele mastroianni who seems to be only one in the building not attending the ceremonies he is well mannered cultured and soon she is attracted to him during the whole film we hear the fascist rally from the radio of the concierge hollering through the courtyard scola playfully uses the camera to make us part of the proceedings after the opening scene the camera swanks across the courtyard of the modernist hypermodern at the time apartment block seemingly searching for our main characters whom we haven t met yet marcello mastrionani and sophia loren are unforgettable in the two leading roles all the more astonishing since they are cast completely against type canadian born john vernon plays loren s husband but he is only on screen in the first and last scene i figure his voice must have been dubbed since he s not of italian descent and never lived there to my knowledge so i cannot imagine he speaks italian if his voice has been dubbed i didn t notice at all on the contrary he s completely believable as an italian even more than the rest of the cast the story is simple but extremely effective the performances are outstanding the ending is just perfect and the framing doesn t come off as overly pretentious but works completely don t miss out on this one camera obscura
i never seem to write a review on imdb unless i am extremely surprised at how good or how bad a movie is this film falls into the first category every year i try to see all the nominees for best foreign film at the oscars even those that i know i won t like as it is in heaven seems to fit the bill the plot sounds sugary and sentimental and slow for my tastes which run more towards original dark and or daring foreign cinema michael haneke francois ozon a lot of modern japanese korean cinema as it is in heaven does not sound particularly interesting it didn t get released in the usa so i sat down to watch a vcd i found in singapore preparing to cross it off the list after a dull beginning as it is in heaven becomes that rare film where you really become inspired by what is happening on screen weak points the characters in the film are pure stock characters the wounded dreamer the town bully the battered wife the loose woman yearning for love the repressed minister thankfully they re largely a likable bunch as well as being well written and well acted ingela olsson as the minister s wife inger would have been nominated for an oscar had her performance been in english strong points the music is beautiful and the main song sung by gabriella is truly dramatic and memorable and keep an eye out for the feisty year old actress playing olga who is keeping up with the dancing steps as well as the younger ladies i won t discuss the ending but i will say that it makes sense they re are a lot of emotional things happening in the last hour of the film and you re not quite sure why they re happening although nothing is explained in words it all makes sense as the movies comes to a fitting crescendo out of probably the strongest swedish movie i ve ever seen
the reviewer who called this movie a bust has clearly missed the point it s obvious he hasn t been young or innocent in a very long time or he might have understood that the tragedy of it was that the well meaning young characters actually thought they could make a difference by putting up posters and holding a rave for peace if only it was that easy but the cynics sit and sneer at people who earnestly try their best to make things better as the situation gets worse and worse every single day well if you re not part of the solution you re part of the problem the central theme is that revenge begets more revenge which begets even more in an ever expanding bloodbath both sides will tell you tales of atrocities committed by the other side which they think justify their committing even more in retaliation where does it end and apparently he missed the significance of the bubble referred to in the name which was that people living in tel aviv are strangely cut off from the ugly realities of what is going on all around them which is partly why they seemed so naive he also seemed to think that ashraf could slip through the checkpoints without a problem which tells me he wasn t paying attention when ashraf related the delays and problems he had encountered i found it very brave of the director the screenplay writer and both star crossed lovers to update the romeo juliet story to a modern troubled land and to make both lovers male let s be honest here very few people would have a problem if one of them had been a female young love wins all hearts but when people s uneasiness with their sexuality is added to the fact that incredibly these same people would rather have them hate each other then the conclusion is inevitable
i actually quite enjoyed this show even as a youngster i was interested in all sports and that included horse racing it was always going to be difficult to make a series based on racing corruption and at the same time get permission from the race tracks to record filming about this controversial subject one episode i particularly remember centred around a horse expected to win a big race that looked a bit off colour a syringe was found on the stable floor and everyone thought it had been drugged but nothing showed up in the blood tests all too late they realised the horse hadnt been doped but had had its knee cartilage removed like running a car with no oil and the engine seizing up the horse broke down with tragic consequences
this is one fine movie i can watch it any time rauol julia gave an outstanding performance we lost him too soon richard dryfus is a great talent only thing it needed more of was dana delany what a babe
cashing in on the demons meets clergy trend of the late s early s that most prominently included the triptych of rosemary s baby the exorcist and the omen the sentinel is an addition that s just as good albeit the most overlooked of the lot in a way it combines the best elements of those films and tosses in a dash of polanski s the tenant which came out the same year for good measure a new york model unable to commit to her lawyer boyfriend takes up residence in a moss coated townhouse that initially seems like the perfect locale she meets a wily old coot of a neighbor the brilliant burgess meredith plus the other off center tenants kept awake by loud noises above her apartment she soon discovers that a mute priest and herself are the only residents in the otherwise deserted building from there director michael winner death wish kicks this supernatural thriller into gear and there is a devilish glee to the hallucinogenic tortures he inflicts on his heroine aided by a brilliant ensemble cast a subtle storyline and excellent makeup fx by dick smith the exorcist the sentinel is a genuinely creepy horror flick
the wooden horse is a very clever movie about a very clever and successful escape plan worked out by british pow s during world war ii it is superbly acted with a wry sense of humor especially the lines expressed by the acid tongues leo genn anthony steele and david tomlinson later george banks in mary poppins are marvelous as the two heroes the direction is taut and fast moving throughout highly recommended
this very peculiar setting of wagner s last opera definitely grew on me when i first saw it i was somewhat annoyed by many of the films surrealistic images and felt that far too much was superimposed upon the story however if you can put up with a fair amount of rather recherch gimmicks i think you will find that the film does manage to capture the very strange other worldly atmosphere of the opera and that there are moments which are particularly fine personally i never really understood the role of kundry until i saw how edith clever portrayed her her performance a lip synchronized mime of the singing voice of yvonne minton is nothing short of dazzling from end to end and alone justifies the hours it takes to absorb the film another reason to delight in this film is that it captures the spectacular interpretation of robert lloyd of the crucial role of gurnemanz one which lloyd has performed to a crisp at opera houses throughout the world i have been privileged to enjoy him in the role of gurnemanz on the stage of the metropolitan opera several times and the lusciousness of his voice and the warm fatherliness of his interpretation of this noble character really needed to be preserved as did his performance in the character s two major monologues the karfreitag scene and the recounting of the prophecy in act the version i have seen was a videotape made for america and so there were subtitles which alas could not be done away with this is especially unfortunate because the translation used is very inaccurate and forces an extremely christian interpretation on a film which is already forcing layers of interpretation on the opera this seemed to me to be quite contrary both to wagner s clear avoidance of christianity and his very deliberate attempt to generalize the christian elements of the story see footnote with spoiler at the end of this review i find it nearly impossible when viewing a film with subtitles to keep from absorbing them and strongly recommend that if in the dvd versions you have the ability to turn the subtitles off you do so and instead if the opera is unfamiliar to you that you read the libretto carefully beforehand the bottom line is that there is much in the film which i dislike and would just as soon have seen done differently but it has risen steadily in my estimation over the years since i first saw it and i find myself drawn to enjoy it again and again footnote containing a spoiler a good example would be kundry s famous line i saw him him and laughed this gets translated in the subtitles for reasons which escape me as i saw the savior s face it is especially irritating to me because throughout the libretto wagner very deliberately and carefully refers to this unseen character who need not be the biblical jesus as der heiland i e the german for the healer a reference to the wound of amfortas and to all wounds and maladies and the need for healing
i have seen this film on countless occasions and thoroughly enjoyed it each time this is mostly due to the lovely erika eleniak a great actress with incredible looks plus any film starring tom berenger and dennis hopper is bound to be entertaining
outside the household is a different world and the family struggle to tread the line between dads authority and their hopes and dreams the period is captured the bakelite light swithes the georgian floorpan the picture rails the wall paper the short skirts the cheeky lads the mini van shiny modern mangles the location is captured a wind lashed glacier hewn rocky landscape walls of local stone community freedom but there is much much more childhood happiness sensuality pride values freedom authority rebellion violence in the deepest sense love struggle puberty naivety morality trust faith deceit machismo manners maturity loss poverty sacrifice horror acceptence revelation comedy and parenthood are all there and in no particular order this film is a richly woven expression of family tensions that are as relevent today as ever the fact that some of these aren t tackled directly is testament in itself to the attitudes of the day but the fact that they are all here is a testament to the acting skill the story and the direction if there s anything bad about this film it s that all this deeply entrenched and wonderfully enacted tension is swept away a little too lightly towards the end maybe i missunderstand the doom and gloom felt by many teenagers really does disappear if they deal with it maybe the film is trying to send even that message too well worth doing what is the film trying to say kids parents were young too parents struggle too everyone makes mistakes everyone learns things change struggle can end happily parents don t try too hard try to remember that your support is the key to their well being it sounds simplistic doesn t it sometimes the film feels like that too but it s then that you notice how much is being being challenged and uncovered the film is a classic not the problems themsleves
i disagree strongly with anyone who might dismiss this film as just entertainment set right after the carefree roaring s during the early days of the great depression dance fools dance is at its heart an earnest cautionary tale with a clear message about how best to endure these hard times yet this fast paced and tightly plotted film is far from being a dreary morality tale in the s hollywood had a knack for churning out one entertaining and enlightening audience pleaser after another all without wasting a frame of film dance fools dance one of four films that harry beaumont directed in is barely minutes long yet its characters are well developed its story never seems rushed and despite its many twists in plot the audience is never left behind with the lone exception of lester vail as flaccid love interest bob townsend the supporting cast is uniformly strong worthy of note are william bakewell as crawford s brother cliff edwards best known as the voice of jiminy cricket as reporter bert scranton and clark gable in an early supporting role as gangster jake luva but this is joan crawford s film and she absolutely shines in it made when she was just this lesser known version of crawford will probably be unrecognizable to those more familiar with her later work however here is proof that long before she took home an oscar for mildred pierce crawford was a star in the true sense of the word a terrific actress with the charisma to carry a picture all by herself score eight out of ten
the movie only enter the cinema in indonesia this year two years after it s official release and after many illegal dvd s had found its way to the public apparently the popularity of the illegal dvd s lead to the release into the theaters with still public coming to watch the movie is a great epic bringing japanese culture into your house in an exiting way in a sometimes humorist way the story is told about a theater writer who writes a story for his theater since the regular kabuki theater plays is something he finds boring at first the audience might be a little bit confused about which story we are following but when the story unfolds we see that the love between a male human and a female demon leads to a great story for a new kabuki theater piece the audience is left in the dark if this is a story that is supposed to really have happened in japanese traditions and mythology but that doesn t matter the way the story is told with a love for theater expression vivid colors humor and tragedy makes this a great ride on the roller coaster of japanese cinema as well as theater let yourself go completely when you watch this movie try to see it in a cinema instead of on your television at home one critical point though the soundtrack is sometimes a little bit annoying though most of it is great music there are a few moments in the movie that i think they should have chosen some more dramatic music but maybe the fact that the story contains moments of humor made the director choose for lighter moments in music as well
some of the acknowledged altman masterpieces seem sadder to me now maybe it s me like the last reviewer i even like this lesser altman shown recently on fmc although i don t think he was aiming at a wide audience organization politics as a microcosm for public campaigns some of this satirical docudrama is now dated like dick cavett watching the tonight show but i found much of the dialog funny and insightful e g you are for real that means you re no threat to anyone the story isn t profound but i liked it and the performances are funny especially cavett as himself lauren bacall as an aging conservative figurehead glenda jackson who actually became a member of parliament as a left wing ideologue in the opening scene lecturing someone dressed as a carrot on the sanctity of politics and carol burnett as a basket case all in the inimitable altman style although maybe not quite as inimitable as usual but pretty inimitable
the best modesty blaise movie i have seen so far it s like a good pilot for a tv series i even think it s a little bit cult like with a lite touch of quentin tarantino s magic or something they have caught a great deal of modesty s character but i admit missing willy garwin a bit even if i have read many comics and book by peter o donnell i m not disappointed of this film quite the opposite positive surprised of this story about modesty and her childhood i did not put my expectations so high because of the bad movie from so i may have overrate this movie just a little but if you like the comics and other storys about modesty blaise you should definitely see this one can t wait for a follow up

this is a unique and bold film it s energetic with highly developed characters very good performances i love directors who are not afraid to ask the audience to think bret carr dares to look inward ask questions and dig underneath the surface by the nature of the film it practically demands that the viewer look inward as well it can take some courage to do this i can see how some close minded people might find this quite disturbing however i found it thought provoking much more than just entertainment bret carr is truly an original filmmaker with vision i am curious to see what he will do next watch him
this movie is great brad pitt will never be able to out act the performance he gave in this movie duchovny was top notch as was forbes and lewis the main characters embark on a scenic road tour of historic murder sites in one of the coolest cars ever made s model lincoln continental early grace is a simpleton with a taste for dry toothbrushes and carnage he likes his women to not curse or smoke and wear pwt dresses duchovny and forbes are a pair of artists from the city while early and lewis are trailer parkers from the rural outskirts even though the majority tone in the film is dark there are plenty of funny scenes to be had the writing directing and acting are brilliant if you like road movies murder humor and narration watch this film everyone delivers and you will want more when the credits roll one of my all time favorites hey shave that dog n teach it to hunt
i watched to movie today and it just blew my mind away it is a real masterpiece of art and i don t understand why most of the people think it s garbage the main idea of the movie take your ego away and then you will have true power this was the main battle at the end of the movie and guy ritchie has shown that in a magnificent way the greatest enemy will hide in the last place you will ever look do you remember this from the movie because our true enemy is in us it is our ego that voice that always tells us that we are important that gives us our pride that tells us not to give but only to take that creates our aggression that wants to be in control that creates all the negative feelings and thoughts gr expressed this idea in an astonishing way and has shown that the only way to gain true control is when you loose control and you just let go of your personal importance a superb movie
i recall seeing this film on tv some years ago and not paying full attention maybe even missing the first half so i came to the conclusion that it was dull and over rated i decided to revisit it last night to see if i had missed anything the first time i certainly did this is one of the most disturbing and amazing films of all time and it has clearly had much influence on films today and probably will forever i can t believe i thought this film was boring a young jon voight and burt reynolds give the performances of their careers and are supported by ned beatty and ronny cox this story will leave you with a sense of disgust and dread long after you watch it it is truly horrifying oh and did i mention that the theme song is great as well well it is and this movie should be seen by movie fans everywhere everyone should see this movie for the experience just don t expect a picnic
some spoilers if you are a big horror movie fan then you will know that halloween paved the way for many slasher films often imitated never duplicated this movie is a true horror classic and is definitely one of the scariest movies ever made if not the scariest i actually saw this movie after seeing the rest of the series don t ask me why i honestly saw the other movies before seeing this one that s just how it worked out but i would have to say this one blows all the others away it is genuinely frightening and seeing michael pop out from behind a bush or walk around in the dark sends a chill down your spine my favorite part of the movie was when michael stabs a guy and leans his head to one side it is one of the eeriest images in movie history later slashers such as the friday the th films were more fun and less intense than this movie i do like the f series better than the halloween series but this movie alone is better than all the f movies michael myers is such a scary villain because he is realistic you could imagine a crazed guy like him going around killing people i admit this movie gave me nightmares after watching it for a few nights what s great about this movie is that it doesn t rely on gore or humor to entertain the audience it is just pure terror it s too bad the later films of the series swayed from this one because this is as good of an example of a spectacular slasher movie as they come

six degrees is a wonderful show i watched the entire season online since i just found it and was terribly disappointed that there will not be a season and to top it all off abc has now taken it off line so it is unable to be viewed online anymore why would abc create such a wonderful show with a great story line and with great characters just to pull it off the air without ever completing the tale it seems it is left to our imagination to figure out what happens to all of our connected characters honestly though i feel that abc could at least place the show online for viewers who enjoied it while they continue to air overrated reality tv shows six degrees we will miss you
a weird witty and wonderful depiction of family life writer andrew marshall has written something that is funny foreboding and occasionally frightening yes don t be fooled by point children s cheerful tune and bubbly characters the show has a dark side and at times can be quite chilling and that s what s so good about the show it s not just a simplistic sitcom where every character is a d comic device the case with my family instead the characters are fully rounded individuals that show the full roller coaster of human emotions the occasionally dark moments such as bill being supposedly haunted by a curse and ben waking up in a bizarre village are two examples of the show taking a surreal dark turn that help add a little depth of course the show is also incredibly funny and is a guaranteed to make you smile it s a real shame eureka video have stopped releasing this comical gold on dvd veoh com is your last hope to get hold of episodes unavliable in the shops
one of the most important artistic movements in the history of cinema was without a doubt german expressionism the highly atmospheric style of film making developed during the s in berlin classic movies like das cabinet des dr caligari and nosferatu eine symphonie des grauens were the most famous direct results of this movement and while the movement didn t have a long life its enormous influence over cinema can still be felt today specially in the horror genre one of the key figures of this style would be director paul wegener director of s der golem wie er in die welt kam as in his debut as a filmmaker seven years before the making of that classic he was already making experiments with expressionism in film that early prototype of german expressionism was incidentally another horror film der student von prag der student von prag the student of prague is the story of balduin paul wegener a student with the reputation of being the best fencer in prague but who always find himself with financial troubles one day balduin rescues the beautiful countess margit grete berger from drowning in a lake after her horse drop her by accident balduin falls immediately in love with her and tries to see her again but soon he discovers that he ll have to compete with her rich cousin graf von schwarzenberg lothar k rner who also wants to marry her knowing that he can t offer her much balduin wishes to be wealthy and this is where a sorcerer named scapinelli john gottowt enters the scene scapinelli offers balduin infinite wealth in exchange of whatever he finds in his room balduin accepts the proposal only to discover in horror that what scapinelli wants is his reflection in the mirror loosely inspired by edgar allan poe s short story william wilson and the classic legend of faust the story of der student von prag was conceived by german writer hanns heinz ewers a master of horror literature and one of the first writers to consider scriptwriting as valid as any other form of literature written at a time where cinema in germany was still being developed as an art form der student von prag shows a real willingness to actually use cinema to tell a fully developed story beyond a camera trick or a series of scenes like most of the scriptwriters of his time ewers screenplay is still very influenced by theater although der student von prag begins to move away from that style while a bit poor on its character development specially on the supporting characters ewers manages to create an interesting and complex protagonist in the person of balduin while der student von prag was paul wegener s directorial debut and stellan rye s second film as a filmmaker it s very clear that these two pioneers had a very good idea of what cinema could do when done properly giving great use to guido seeber s cinematography the two young filmmakers create a powerful gothic atmosphere that forecasts what the german filmmakers of the following decade would do wegener would learn many of the techniques he would employ in his golem series from seeber and rye despite having very limited resources rye and wegener manage to create an amazing and very convincing for its time visual effect for the scenes with balduin s reflection played by wegener too already an experienced stage actor at the time of making this film wegener directs the cast with great talent and also attempts to move away from the stagy style of previous filmmakers as balduin paul wegener is very effective and probably the best in the movie it certainly helps that his character is the only one fully developed by the writer but one can t deny that wegener was very good in his role as the poor student who loses more than his mirror reflection in that contract john gottowt plays the sinister scapinelli with mysterious aura that suits the character like a glove few is said about scapinelli in the film but gottowt makes sure to let us know that he is a force to be feared the rest of the main cast is less lucky with grete berger being pretty much average as countess margit and lothar k rner making a poor graf von schwarzenberg however it must be said that lyda salmonova was pretty good in her expressive character and fritz weidemann made an excellent baron waldis schwarzenberg showing the dignity that l rner s character should have had considering the movies that were being done in those years in other countries and the fact that its remake made years after this film is superior in every possible way it s not difficult to understand why der student von prag hasn t stood the test of time as well as other early films the movie s main problem is definitely its extremely low budget as it resulted in the film being considerably shorter than what ewers story needed to be fully developed this makes the plot feel a bit too vague at times or even incomplete as if there was something missing in the narrative of course there s also the possibility that the existing print is really incomplete however der student von prag is a very interesting early attempt at a complex tale of horror and suspense in film that while inferior to what other filmmakers were doing at the time left a powerful impression in history as the direct predecessor of the german expressionist movement it s hard to deny the enormous importance that der student von prag has in the history of german cinema probably in the history of cinema in general it may look dated even for its time but considering the limited resources its director had it s truly better than most films from that era as the movie that started paul wegener s career and with that german expressionism der student von prag is a must see for everyone interested in this slice of film history
plenty has been written about mamet s the house of games most of it good i decided to revisit the flick to see how it held up after years and was surprised at how much i enjoyed viewing it again the film s success and durability probably has much to do with two principal ingredients which are always fun on film a good story and a good scam mamet manages to bring his signature moodiness and obvious histrionics to the film while scamming us the audience and the mark simultaneously then he explains the art of conning only to do it again etc all the while building the story the house of games now a freebie on cable is worth a look for first timers and an okay rerun for mamet fans b
my left foot is a pretty impressive film that tells the story of christy brown an artist who was crippled with cerebral palsy and learned to paint with his left foot the only limb in his body he had control over daniel day lewis won his first oscar as best actor for this film which i m not absolutely certain was deserved but is still noteworthy day lewis give brown a realistic and occasionally almost humorous touch brenda fricker as brown s devoted mother also won an oscar for a believable and touching role my problem with this film is that it is a bit too real at times when brown is in desperation and must help someone and do it all with his left foot the film can be difficult to watch this gives it an often depressing feel that may turn off some viewers for a time however if you look beyond that you will see a sense of hope and inspiration for those who have handicaps and other difficulties to overcome those of us who are not crippled and still consider ourselves to have problems are inspired by this film because if somewhat with a much worse condition than us can overcome their difficulties we can certainly do the same thing well made occasionally enjoyable but difficult to watch may not be for everyone but not bad at all out of
kalifornia is a good hollywoodish odyssey of suspense and terror which tells of two couples who drive cross country to california to share the cost of gas a pair of losers lewis pitt and two wannabee artists a photographer and a writer duchovny forbes pitt nails his character which is the focus of this somewhat predictable thriller a good watch for those into psycho killer flix
if you ve seen this movie you ve been to puerto rico i ve lived in puerto rico all my life and have to shamefully admit that we pr are living a real chaos right now drugs being the main reason for the shootings and killings we have almost every day these people will shoot anyone anytime and anywhere and many innocent lives have been lost because of this we don t feel safe anymore and in addition to this our so called justice is no longer moved by truth and rightness but by money influence and power ladrones y mentirosos is based on real deplorable facts and truly portrays puerto rico s three main problems the drug related killings money and power manipulating our courtrooms and innocent people and children being corrupted and even dying because of this ricardo and his wife poli with their true to life plot and their award winning direction were brave enough to present all this as bad as it is puerto rico is a beautiful and friendly country living a nightmare that doesn t seem to end they recently won the copper wing award for best director in the world cinema competition at the phoenix film festival
with iphigenia mikhali cacoyannis is perhaps the first film director to have successfully brought the feel of ancient greek theatre to the screen his own screenplay an adaptation of euripides tragedy was far from easy compared to that of the other two films of the trilogy he directed the story has been very carefully deconstructed from euripides version and placed in a logical strictly chronological framework better conforming to the modern methods of cinematic story telling cacoyannis also added some characters to his film that do not appear in euripides tragedy odysseus calchas and the army this was done in order to make some of euripides points regarding war the church and government clearer finally cacoyannis iphigenia ending is somewhat ambiguous when compared to euripides the film was shot on location at aulis the director of photography giorgos arvanitis shows us a rugged but beautiful greece where since the homeric days time seems to have stood still he takes advantage of the bodies the arid land the ruins the intense light and the darkness the harshness of the landscape is particularly fitting to the souls of the characters the camera uses the whole gamut of available shots from the very long reinforcing the vastness and desolation of the landscape as well as the human scale involved to the extreme close ups dissecting and probing deep into the soul of the tormented characters in particular the film s opening with a bold accelerating tracking shot along a line of beached boats followed by an aerial view of the many thousands of soldiers lying listlessly on the beach is a very effective means of communicating agamemnon s awesome political and military responsibility no word but sublime can describe the stunning performances of costa kazakos agamemnon irene papas clytemnestra and tatiana papamoschou iphigenia kazakos and papas embody the sublimity of the classical greece tragedy kazakos character is extremely down to earth and his powerful look into the camera more than his words reveals the unbelievable torment tearing his soul irene papas is the modern quintessence of classic greek plays in iphigenia she is terrible in her anguish and even more so for what we know will be her vengeance tatiana papamoskou in her first role on the screen is outstanding in her portray of the innocent iphigenia which contrasts with kazakos austere depiction of her father agamemnon cacoyannis is faithful to euripides in his representation of the other characters odysseus is a sly scheming politician achilles a vain narcissistic warrior menalaus is self centered obsessed with his honor eager to be avenged and to have his wife and property restored the costumes and sets are realistic no hollywood there agamemnon s quarters resembles a barn he dresses as do the others in utilitarian hand woven simple garb clytemnestra s royal caravan is made up of rough hewn wooden carts the music is by the prolific contemporary music composer mikis theodorakis theodorakis score intensifies the dramatic and cinematographic unfolding reflects on the psychological aspect of the tragedy and accentuates its dimensions and actuality this film and the story it narrates offer considerable insight into the lost world of ancient greek thought that was the crucible for so much of our modern civilization it teaches us much about ourselves as individuals and as social and political creatures euripides questions the value of war and patriotism when measured against the simple virtues of family and love and reflects on woman s vulnerable position in a world of manly violence in his adaptation of euripides tragedy cacoyannis revisits all of these themes in a modern clear and dramatic fashion the relationships governing the political machinations are clearly demonstrated war corrupts and destroys the human soul to such an extent that neither the individual nor the group can function normally any longer with the possible exception of menelaus whose honor has been tarnished by his own wife s elopement with her lover everyone else has his own private motivation for going to war with troy which has nothing to do with helen the thirst for power agamemnon greed the army odysseus or glory achilles and so in a real sense helen became the wmd of the trojan war the war stripped of all homeric glamor and religious sanctioning was just an imperialist venture spurred primarily by the desire for material gain all else being a convenient pretext another conflict raised in the film is that between the church and the state calchas who represents the church feeling the challenge to his priestly authority and wishing to destroy agamemnon for the insult to the goddess he serves tells him to sacrifice his daughter in consenting to the sacrifice the king comes closer to his moral undoing but in refusing loses his power over the masses his army who are brainwashed by religion of course for agamemnon it s a game the king must go along with the charade whether he honestly believes in the gods or not until he realizes too late that he has ensnared himself into committing a despicable filicide is it a sacrifice or a murder and how can we tell the difference between the two by focusing on the violent and primitive horror of a human sacrifice and worst of all the sacrifice of one s own child euripides cacoyannis creates a drama that is at once deeply political and agonizingly personal it touches on a most complex and delicate ethical problem facing any society the dire conflict between the needs of the individual versus those of the society in the case of iphigenia however as in the biblical tale of abraham and isaac the father is asked to kill his own child by his own hand what sort of god would insist on such payment can it be just or moral even if divinely inspired finally does the daughter s sacrificial death differ from the deaths of all the sons and daughters who are being sent to war these are many deep questions raised by a two hour film
i saw this movie last night after waiting ages and ages for it to be released here in canada still only in limited release it was worth the wait and then some i am a very avid reader of margaret laurence and was excited to see that this novel was being turned into a film i actually ended up liking the movie better than the novel i liked that the character of bram shipley was a bit less harsh and that there seemed to be more of a love story between hagar and bram which made the scenes at the end of bram s life that much more moving the loss seemed stronger hagar was not any more likable on film than in the book but ellen burstyn was a genius in this role she was hagar through and through christine horne was brilliant and has many more great things ahead i am sure her scenes with cole hauser were electrifying i could go on and on overall a out of fantastic and can t wait for it to come out on dvd a must own for my collection
okay like many other such films spawned out of a snl skit but tim meadows does a fairly fantastic job of making a minute one dimensional character into a moderately viable comedic movie character he drops amusingly consistently threated one liners with fair frequency billy dee williams is in it though his lando days are long gone and the entire thing is shot pretty well true it s not great art but if you went into wayne s world looking for the gone with the wind you did something wrong enjoyable for what it is
here s a rare gem for those of you that haven t seen or most likely not even heard of this during the s dennis quaid was a hot commodity but in the early s dennis quaid disappeared from the scene in he burst back onto the big screen with three movies all of which unfortunately bombed two of those films i liked very much and let me elaborate on one of them wilder napalm is a crazy flick about two brothers wallace quaid and wilder arliss howard whom are fire starters yes they have the power of pyrokinetics wilder has decided not to use his power anymore for anything not useful anyway after a fatal incident during his youth where he and his brother blew up an abandoned house which killed a man who was inside unbeknownest to them nowadays wilder is a firefighter and is married to the wacky vida debra winger who is under house arrest for guess what arson see the movie to understand this better wilder also hasn t spoken to wallace in years because wallace set his hair on fire during his bachelor party wallace loves his pyro power and uses it for amusement he also runs a carnival and is the head clown when the carnival comes to wilder s town wallace decides to reunite with his brother and also to see vida whom which wallace has been in love with vida s house arrest sees its end but wilder is preoccupied so wallace steps in and the fun begins brother vs brother fighting fire with fire some great fireball throwing in this flick eat your heart out drew barrymore the film also has some really weird yet funny elements like wilder s fire unit sings songs acapella during firefights and after wards jim varney globally known as ernest pops in as wallace s redneck carnival buddy wilder napalm is brilliantly shot and cleverly put together very off the wall and avant guard give this one a look
modern original romantic story very good acting of both nicole kidman and ben chaplin miss kidman does a nice job in imitating a russian accent ben chaplin is also good as the shy dull clerk for the men and some women miss kidman looks fantastic and is very sympathetic i forgot what a gorgeous woman she is it s not hard to imagine that john falls in love with her some unexpected turns in the story are good for the suspense although i hoped for a happy ending the last part of the movie was quite a surprise for me conclusion good movie les pays bas huit points
as a child i preferred the first care bear movie since this one seemed so dark i always sat down and watched the first one as i got older i learned to prefer this one what i do think is that this film is too dark for infants but as you get older you learn to treasure it since you understand it more it doesn t seem as dark as it was back when you were a child this movie in my opinion is better than the first one everything is so much deeper it may contradict the first movie but you must ignore the first movie to watch this one the cubs are just too adorable i rewind that flying my colors scene i tend to annoy everyone by singing it the sound track is great a big hand to carol and dean parks i love every song in this movie i have downloaded them all and is all i am listening to i m listening to our beginning also known as recalling at the moment i have always preferred this sound track to the first one although i just totally love carol kings song in the first movie care a lot i think the animation is great the animation in both movies are fantastic i was surprised when i sat down and watched it about years later and saw that the animation for the time was excellent it was really surprising there is not a lot of back up from other people to say that this movie is great but it is i do not think it is weird strange i think it is a wonderful movie basically this movie is about how the care bears came about and to defeat the demon dark heart the end is surprising and again beats any pokemon movie with the care bears moral issues it leaves an effect on you again this movie can teach everyone at all ages about morality
henry fool surprised me i didn t expect it to entertain and amuse as well or as strongly as it did fay grim continues to surprise in that it provides solid continuation to a story that seems not to need it once the viewer watches the first minutes of the movie however it becomes blindingly aware that this is one of the best sequels to brilliant indie film at least as good as ginger snaps back if not better i am a little disappointed that jeff goldblum s part is so small but i m happy he is a part of this short run he is convincing and delightful as agent fulbright also a delight is liam aiken who quite aptly portrays ned grim the son of fay and henry this movie is a pleasure for so many reasons i am pleased for example to discover that henry isn t really the loser he seems by the end of fool and to further discover that he is in fact a genius well that really is a lovely stroke of the pen i am hoping they do a third like the end of the trilogy it seems to be missing they should entitle it ned fool grim and it should be liam looking for his father to validate the awesome change in his mother and the sense of near genius he himself feels welling inside him assuming of course that fay continues withholding many of the most important facts from her son concerning his father it feels like it needs to be done i d buy it even with more action this is still not an action flick it is more drama and intrigue a mystery of sorts i ll watch it often it rates an from the fiend
one of the greatest film i have seen this year last maybe before sun rise which is also seen late at night alone in the lab i like the idea of the film which suggest free will of man and our weakness against fate with time past by james and kathryn are destined to fail and an indescribable sorrow comes i do like the end but a big question also comes the virus shall not be released again should it in the last scene in the airport jose is sent back to meet james again by future scientists when he tell him that scientists had already got his message and know someone else would spread the virus and they two together meet kathryn when kathryn tell james the true man is dr goines assistant so it is clearly jose also get the true information about the virus james keep an eye on him at the time remember and he has teeth so why everything is still happen why future scientists don t do anything after the truth is revealed my biggest question after the film
okay this movie fine like i said but you surely need to watch it as its worth a watch it s about two boys mac and sam who are great friends and work as fashion photographers and the laughing time starts when mac akshay kumar starts dating with air hostesses at the same time leaving his wife suspicious sam attains fortune and almost forgets his friend but not completely but mac thinks so and so he starts dating with air hostesses there s garam masala at every step of the movie songs rock but somethings lacking the comedy s not up to the mark and deserves an award its nice but not all that excellent some people laughed till their stomaches ached but it didn t deserve that many laughs but of course everyone s opinion is different so if you wanna watch the movie you re welcome to do so
this movie is very underrated it s highly imaginative creative and clever it s just plain fun and in my opinion this film tops the first one but the film was forgotten when it first came out and became even more overlooked as the years passed bill ted s bogus journey also bombed at the box office whereas the first one was a pretty good hit and very popular i think the problem may be that this film was just released a couple years too late in bill and ted already seemed so s even though the s were only a couple years ago back at that time the landscape of the music and style for kids had changed so radically with gangsta rap hip hop pearl jam nirvana grunge and the seattle sound bill and ted with their ozzy osbourne van halen and guns n roses music along with their s style seemed so out of place and very outdated in and i think that s one big reason the film bombed at the box office nobody but surfers were still saying stuff like excellent and bogus in gremlins which also came out in the early s suffered a similar fate of being a good film that bombed at the box office because it was too associated with the s the transition from the s to the s was a much faster change then now with the s and s was nothing like or whereas right now and last year still looks looked like or if only excellent adventure which was made in was released that year instead of and bogus journey was made quickly and released in then it too would have probably been just as wildly received as the first
a cry in the dark is a masterful piece of cinema haunting and incredibly though provoking the true story of lindy chamberland who in witnessed a horrific sight seeing her month old baby being brutally taken from their family s tent while camping on the austrailian outback azaria the baby was never seen again and the result of her horrendous disappearance caused a true life frenzy all around the world meryl streep does immaculate justice to the role of lindy as she always does but the one thing that helps a cry in the dark never fall flat is the brilliant direction a truly inspired and accurate outlook on this baffeling case tears are brought to the eyes the concept is nothing less then terrifying and afterwards you are left haunted but also inspired
this movie is very great the acting is fine with excellent casting of corbin bernsen as the perfectionistic dentist who freaks out and tortures his patients in the beginning he sees his wife with the poolman and then he goes crazy he also takes revenge on his wife and the poolman beside the patients he tortures the most special effects are also beautiful although some are really fake like a drilled out tongue that has laid for night outside and is still red in the morning but the torture scenes are absolutely well done though this movie has the weak point that it is very slow between the heavy parts are sometimes just extremiously boring parts but for the real horror thriller fan this is a must watch
my wife kate and i absolutely loved the series and can t wait for the next one hopefully there is a sequel i would love to know what the catchy song is called and who wrote it maybe because i am old and grey and still interested in life if anyone has the full lyrics please send them of course one big reason why my wife and i liked this series so much was that we are years old and retired but still very active intellectually it s great to see a show that highlights the contribution to society that can still be made by older people with special skills and experience the human interest aspect showing the interactions of the characters and the younger people around them is an important part of the show this series is highly entertaining and very sophisticated on a par with some of our other favourites spooks and hustle
ho ho homicidal maniac this spirited tour de force adaptation of a great ec comics horror tale is undoubtedly one of the best episodes of the cable tv series ever made director robert back to the future zemeckis makes the most out of a witty script by fred night of the creeps the monster squad dekker which centers on a ruthless two timing housewife well played by mary ellen trainor who was married to zemeckis when she starred in this episode who kills her jilted jerk of a husband a nice cameo by marshall bell on christmas eve by whacking him upside the head with a fire poker complications ensue when a deranged murderous madman dressed up as jolly kris kringle escapes from a nearby asylum and decides to pay trainor a decidedly unfriendly visit alan silvestri s spooky stirring score and dean cundey s typically polished cinematography further enhance the macabre fun and larry drake the sweet gentle giant benny on l a law with his creepy hiccuping guffaw a demented twinkle in his bright green eyes and a leering truly wicked grin makes for a sensational sanguinary saint nick
i must confess that i was completely shocked by this film for one i went to see it on a whim expecting something mediocre but given this the most shocking thing was that this was in a populist american cinema at all this is british comedy at its finest dark quirky and funny in ways that american films just never are i must stop short however of recommending this wholeheartedly to anyone i went to see it with several people some english some european and some american and while some of us loved it mainly from the first two groups some hated it and found it worthless if you think you re into this kind of thing then go if not don t
steven spielberg wanted to win an oscar so bad that he figured that he wouldn t win by directing special effects epics he was nominated for three of them close encounters of the third kind raiders of the lost ark and e t the extra terrestrial so he decided to get very serious by directing the color purple a period film with no special effects spielberg s first serious drama is a remarkable movie but the academy voters who voted back in still didn t give spielberg any respect the color purple received oscar nominations including best picture but spielberg was unfairly snubbed when he wasn t nominated for best director it got worse on oscar night when this film didn t win a single oscar it got completely shut out that wasn t right the color purple should have won a couple of oscars including one for whoopi goldberg s spectacular film debut as celie a woman who suffers at the hands of an abusive husband frightfully placed by danny glover then gets stronger throughout the film thanks to some special friends oprah winfrey also made her film debut here and gives a great performance as sofia one of those friends of celie since i m from chicago i had already known winfrey from her talk show which at the time of this films release hadn t gone nationwide like goldberg what a film debut margaret avery is terrific as shug avery another friend who also happens to be the mistress of celie s rotten husband all three actresses received well deserved oscar nominations for their work here goldberg for best actress winfrey and avery for best supporting actress set in the south during the first half of the th century the color purple is a film so strong that it made me cry at the end it also made me laugh at times too why academy voters were so hard on not nominating spielberg for best director is a mystery that still puzzles me today but spielberg would eventully go on to win two oscars years later for schindler s list and saving private ryan making him one of the best movie directors of all time but he should have gotten nominated for this movie the job that he did going from special effects blockbusters like e t to a serious drama like the color purple was remarkable out of four
the critics are dumb this movie is funny and smart i loved this movie a lot why does everyone hate this movie so much i wish people would love this movie more than they don t ben stiller and jack black are true comedians and they put through a lot of work to make this movie i don t see you people out there making movies like them so people should just watch it and not comment it i like this movie it is ok through it all there are parts were it get s dumb but at least they made it jerry stiller would love this because this movie has the acting just like the show king of queens but this is better than that i can t believe this was rated so low
considering a star is born had been made twice already by the time the film came into production the latest remake has a freshness about it that can be attributed to the fantastic chemistry between the entire acting ensemble a viewer could be forgiven for believing that kris kristofferson barbara streisand were a couple off screen as well as on with their incredible displays of pure affection towards one another the film has been described in the past as a barbara streisand concert on film set to a soap opera storyline however for anyone that enjoys watching a film that takes you beyond the living room into a world where the characters seem truly alive a star is born is well worth the hiring price with its incredible soundtrack flawless acting and touching reality in regards to human emotions and the true frailty of life a star is born is a film that draws you into the world of esther hoffman the love of her life john norman howard a film for anyone that sees the beauty in real love the kind that keeps you devoted to a person even as they break your heart
a number of factors make it easy for me to state that i still think this is the most important science fiction film ever made despite some of the acting outdated dialogue etc first there is the scale of imagination in describing the krell a humanoid race native to the planet now all dead who were million years more advanced than earth humans us and their technology particularly the cubic mile machine second there is the music and sound effects which are inseparable from each other it creates an eerie unearthly feeling unlike which had traditional classical music third its monster is not only the most powerful and deadly ever envisioned it s also based on real science and doesn t break the laws of physics and biology finally and most importantly forbidden planet is the only movie ever made that attempts and more incredibly succeeds in making an honest intelligent and mercilessly logical statement on the limits or ceiling of human or any other biological entity s development no matter how long we survive as a species in other words it predicts our inevitable destiny

overall i agree wholly with ebert s review in a sense i feel that i should not even be commenting since it is so much a vet s movie and i am not a vet i was a resister the flaw is that martha is badly underdeveloped and does not act consistently my guess is that stephen metcalfe is a vet himself and spent too little planning time on her character
i originally reviewed this film on amazon about or years ago and blasted it i believe i called it wretched and a turkey okay well by most standards it s still a turkey it s got almost no production values what little plot there is makes almost no sense and the acting is on the level of a third grade play that said this has really grown on me over the years as a sort of camp classic in fact all of director todd sheets films have had this effect they re almost like ed wood in that regard watch them over and over and pick out the flubbed lines continuity errors same zombie two different locations and other flaws i ll say this sheets is a very nice guy and while this one of his first productions isn t that great he has gotten better and i must add that the only really decent actor actress in the film is kasey rousch though i may be biased as i attended school with her
what we have here is a compelling piece of low budget horror with a relatively original premise a cast that is filled with familiar faces and one of the most convincing filming locations in the history of horror films so could anyone please tell me why this movie is so utterly underrated prison is the finnish director harlin s american debut which still counts as his best effort even though he went on making blockbuster hits like die hard cliffhanger and deep blue sea the story entirely takes place in an ancient and ramshackle wyoming prison re opened for the cause of over population in other more modern state penitentiaries inside the former execution dungeons the restless spirit of the electric chair s last victim still dwells around the now promoted warden eaton sharpe lane smith was there already years ago when this innocent man was put to death and the spirit still remembers his vile role in the unfair trial it seems that the time for vengeance has finally arrived viggo mortensen plays the good car thief who has to prevent an even larger body count and chelsea field is the humane social worker who slowly unravels the secrets from the past prison contains over half a dozen memorable gore sequences but it s the unbearably tense atmosphere that ll stick to you for certain unlike any other horror picture from that decade prison features an amazing sense of realism by this i refer to the authentic scenery and the mood inside the prison walls of course and not towards the supernatural murders that are being committed even though these are genuinely unsettling as well the film s best parts are images of realistic and tough prison drama sequences combined with visual mayhem and shocking horror the absolute best terror moment providing me with nightmares ever since i saw it at rather young age focuses on a grizzly death struggle involving barbed wire haunting the screenplay only suffers one flaw but that s a common one almost inevitable i guess clich s the story introduces nearly every possible stereotype there is in a prison surrounding we ve got the ugly fat pervert with his cute boy toy the cowardly and racist guard avoids confrontation at all costs and naturally the old n wise black con who serves a lifetime did i hear anybody yell the name morgan freeman don t stare yourself blind on these clich s is my advise as there are so many other elements to admire the photography is dark and moist the mystery is upheld long and successfully and the supportive inmate roles of class b actors are excellent the fans will recognize tom everett tom tiny lister and even immortal horror icon kane hodder forget about wes craven s god awful attempt shocker or the downright pathetic cheese flick the chair this is the only prison chiller worth tracking down especially considering viggo mortensen peaking popularity nowadays i heard he starred in a successful franchise involving elves hobbits and other fairy creatures this true s horror gem oughts to get an urgent dvd release

a bug s life is a very good animated feature this movie is for younger children but it is also a great movie for people my age the story is about an ant named flik he brought havoc onto his colony when he destroyed the food that were for the superior grasshoppers he gets banished and he must find bigger bugs to fix the mess this movie is a classic because it is a good movie and it is a pixar movie the animation is brilliant especially for the late s the story is good but a little more detail would be suffice the voice acting is good as with most animation movies the music is nice to listen to nothing special but it earned an nomination for one of the music categories overall this movie struck me as awestruck this is a good movie for all families i rate this movie

one of the things that makes this ealing comedy so outrageously funny is the clever editing shots that would be considered absolutely essential to most modern comedies are deliberately left out this is what was known as british understatement three instances a comic fight is edited like this alec guiness has invented a new cloth that will ruin the industry half a dozen businessmen invite him to their office to try to get him to sign a contract relinquishing his control of the cloth so that production can be suppressed when he catches on to this guiness stands up and turns to walk to the door two men block his way excuse me he says quietly taking a step forward the two men move between guiness and the camera cut a secretary is sitting outside at her desk there is silence until the buzzer begins signaling her frantically she takes up her notebook and opens the door to the inner office where a full fledged noisy donnybrook is in progress and the room is half wrecked guiness dashes out the open door the following example would be unthinkable today during the research phase of his invention guiness sets up an elaborate chemical apparatus but instead of converting the experimental liquid into the new cloth the device explodes again and again it explodes the laboratory is cleared of all other work the blasts continue ceilings fall down windows are blown out the director of research is seated at his desk in a tiny office cluttered with debris a bandage on his head when the door behind him opens he jumps a foot in the air sit down he tells his visitor there s another one due at any moment it is excruciatingly amusing and there is not a single shot of any explosions this would be unimaginable now without a fireball and maybe a building collapsing in slow motion last example consisting of a series of quick relentless cuts put together precisely guiness is being pursued and is cornered in the lobby of an office building by people who want him to sign the contract faced with two men about to grapple with him guiness backs up with a determined expression he bumps against a pedestal with an iron bust on it the bust topples backward and bumps against the wall there is a shot lasting about one second of the bust hitting the wall another brief shot of a metal shield hung above the bust being jarred loose and falling down quick cut to guiness s head rising into the frame cut to the two men staring into the camera while horrible brass banging and thudding sounds are heard off screen cut to guiness flat on his back nobody today would have the cojones to not show guiness being crowned by that shield i won t go on with this it s a comedy alright but a pretty bitter one underneath all the hilarity in solving one set of problems guiness has created dozens of others he is opposed both by management and labor neither of which is shown to much advantage and of course the economic implications have to do with more than cloth what about that car that runs on water with a pinch of something or other in it one of the workers asks vested interests comments another worker as thorstein veblen nods in his grave what would happen if our problems with energy were solved overnight if i owned shares of exxon and i think i do i d shudder at the thought where would the oil industry be if there were no more need for oil for that matter where would the police force and the fbi be if crime were to suddenly disappear this is a thoughtful and very amusing movie superbly directed and edited the roster of performers is peerless joanne greenwood with that husky voice the blithering cecil parker the wheezing mummified ernest thesiger a first rate job all around
the best cheech chong movie so far of all the cheech and chong this is most certain the best so far i think i ve seen them all about twelve times at least and i love them all but this is most definitely the best compared with the others this one covers a lot of themes and gives you a lot of good laughs part of the texts are still part of our language today after years i hope that one day they can make another one because they still are great comedians i heard they are writing a new script so who knows i guess these guys are the only ones who succeeded in making decent movies in this genre i wonder if john ashcroft ever watched one of them
one of the great mysteries of life suffered from daily is why nice girls so often are more interested in the jerks and heels than in the nice guys worse when the nice guys even want to marry those girls the girls still prefer the jerks and heels even after the jerks and heels have shown their contempt have shown they re just interested in using the girls stu erwin is the nice guy who continues to be nice after being lied to and cheated and even after losing the girl completely clark gable is the jerk and he is perfect in the role rather a sad note to his fans jean harlow comes across as a more slender mae west even sounding like la west in some of her cynical throwaway lines somewhat puzzling is that so many of the other characters intended to be bad guys i mean heck they re locked up so they must be are so obviously nice people in fact there are lots of nice people here people who in a lesser film or story would be snarling and back stabbing but here go out of their way to help someone else so maybe the story is rather clich d at least by modern standards but ultimately the viewer will be glad to have watched the biggest complaint i have is that so many really good actors are not given credit once again we can say a fervent thank you to imdb com
i ve watched this movie twice and i plan to see it again it is the movie that puts you in the director s place regarding his romantic relations and the political situation in israel it also makes me cry because of remembering the wonderful time it was and the horrible murder described there it is really worth watching
what a delightful movie the characters were not only lively but alive mirroring real every day life and strife within a family each character brought a unique personality to the story that the audience could easily associate with someone they know within their own family or circle of close friends the story has a true to life flow that the viewer can assimilate into and be part of the drama the laughter and tears as the plot of the movie develops the script does a good job of capturing the common emotions actions and reactions of the characters to conflict opinion and resolve not an epic but it is a very nice movie to watch with loved ones plenty of knowing head nods and ahhh moments to share and enjoy
this movie was one of the funniest movie i ve seen in years and the laughs from the audience members support me not since my big fat greek wedding has the laughter been as spontaneous and intense easily has intricate as last year s mr and mrs smith in its use of parody espionage in mr and mrs smith and sex in my super ex girlfriend director s ivan reitman balance between comedy and drama between crazy and downright ludicrous is great never does the shock and dramatic serious crack the rule of comedy at the same time this predictable romantic comedy never loses its touching emotional elements even if the ending is broadcast in advance in some ways it s so evident that it s great to see how it plays out just like in real life sometimes the truth is so evident that one can t really see it easily eight out of ten stars ranking up there with tootsie possibly a nine depends on how it appears on a second viewing
trick or treat quickie review this zany romp of a film revolves around the s culture of heavy metal and horror movies two things which i love dearly so as you can imagine this movie appealed to me pretty easily plus for no apparent reason ozzy osbourne plays a preacher this film is about an unpopular high school youth who like all us losers ended up drenched in a world of evil heavy metal his favorite metaldude dies and of course is miraculously resurrected by playing his latest unreleased album backwards this allows the corpsified singer to go around killing people with demons and sh t helping out okay it s pretty cheesy at times but you know what it s got a surprising number of good qualities decent acting including gene simmons as a radio dj pretty good special effects very brief nudity decent atmosphere all in all it s actually a decent horror film but what really sucks is the music ironic huh well this uber evil metal guy is one of the most obnoxious high pitched wailing motley crue rejects on the planet and the metal is little more than putrid s pop hair metal he hits all the clich s here from prancing around like a gay fairy to looking mean to screaming rock and roll in a pitch high enough to make king diamond retch aside from that atrocious musical representation it s actually pretty good www residenthazard com
i can t believe john died while filming an episode he collapsed on set read this out of his biography online john ritter was born in burbank calafornia on september th he landed his last television role in simple rules for dating my teenage daughter based on the popular book on this sitcom he played paul hennessey a loving yet rational dad who laid down the ground rules for his three children the show was a ratings winner in its first season and won a peoples choice award for best new comedy and also won for favorite comedy series by the family awards while working simple rules he also starred in his second to last film manhood that same year while john was rehearsing for the th rd series episode of simple rules now shortened he fell ill henry winkler described it as john looked like he had food poisoning then he collapsed on the set he was quickly rushed to a nearby hospital the same burbank hospital where he was born he was diagnosed with an aorta dissection an unrecognized heart flaw he underwent surgery but did not make it john ritter died at age just week away from his th birthday leaving his wife amy yasbeck and children
i recently saw this movie in my international business class i was not expecting anything other then another boring documentary not to say i don t love documentary i ve just hard bad luck with movies in that class imagine my surprise when this movie that s actually a movie came up this film is a tell all of cultural differences in the work place and how they need to cooperate to get anywhere the culture clash shows just how different the world is and just how differently we perceive ourselves until someone comes along and gives us a wake up call i would highly recommend this film to anyone in business or who just wants a laugh because yes it is funny well that s about it cheers
my take on this at our local festival where people would see me so often they thought me a better source than i may actually have been began with a head shake well i can t summarize the plot but it s a really superb character study of an extremely scary man then slight embarrassment i ran into someone who actually knew what had gone down that is from whom trebor unwittingly gets his new heart it d been my last film in a long long day halfway through the festival maybe i d dozed the better a film is the more likely it triggers daydreams that send me really dreaming don t know did know there was an o henry twist achingly just beyond my ken as things finished and knew it had to do with the heart hence the quietly hilarious talent search my plot loss remark had more to do with intricacies of trebor s connections in france his relation to the dog woman and so on stuff i d been wide awake for denis barely glances at details that might have anchored another director s treatment but i write these things too often from memory especially festival films films whose dvd i don t have at hand le lait de la tendresse humaine is one of many examples and plot kinks fade much more quickly than broader impressions still or already l inrus in my memory is beyond all else a character study of a sort of dark side superman a super fiend not ensconced in genre or historical trappings but active and plausible relatively soft spoken driven but patient right among us the scar once he attains it makes him just visually i mean in image a sort of hybrid frankenstein monster mad doctor and creation all in one the actual doctors are his tools if he doesn t extract and install the heart himself it s only because it s not possible he s the force always the parasite consuming everyone he touches and finally himself what else is he to suggest that he s us the first world versus the third seems too simple since he feeds no less on his fellow first worlders on all of us denis s camera s eye when it looks at things i know goes usually where mine would so i tend to trust her when she looks at things i don t know snow trekking too fast bicycling and forest darkness i ve known in small ways but the south seas not at all so i made better entry into l intrus both france and the crystalline isles of its finish than into beau travail l intrus is for me a very comfortable discomforting film it s a sequence of places portrayed familiarly with a intimacy that allows us to know them whether we ve seen the reality or not a single image trebor cycling his massive weight on the thin racing frame the sounds of violated air and shrieking tires the asphalt ribbon the dark in bright sun evergreens cued me that the film would be linear a road trip a single will driven thrust despite trebor s personal power he s a human failure no matter who he s with he s alone though apparently he hasn t always been his body aborts life twice first to need the new heart then despite it l intrus is tragedy trebor is hubris i m navigating perilously the thread of what i remember let s leave it at that
the mother is that extraordinary piece of film making it gets you thinking it pulls no punches and ultimately it leaves you thinking very much open ended as to the lead character s fate anne reid which i only knew briefly from her appearances in some victoria wood led projects and thought a fine comedienne is truly superb here not the stereotypical widowed housewife that was perfect in marriage and motherhood at all and not all that free spirited and adventurous at first she plays her character just with the right note that rings true well it did to me powerful cast great script renaissance of european cinema indeed
another entertaining travolta dance flick great music mood and scenes debra winger is beautiful like saturday night fever this macho film features extremely improbable scenes of beautiful women falling for travolta and almost begging him to have sex with them
von trier once explained how he created such strong involvement from the viewer with his movies by placing his movie world in about the middle of the real world and the imagined world so as viewers we think we watch a true story while in fact we are thoroughly manipulated often to the point that the movie works disturbing dancer in the dark or painful the idiots idioterne of course the dogme films acted only as a vehicle for this theory besides creating some welcome spotlight on von trier the story is typical for von trier our hero is idealistic seems to balance his relations with everybody else but soon becomes the victim of the problems others have created in the past for themselves the idealist inevitably has to reject society in order to stay idealistic and becomes the terrorist mankind is spoiled and purity only leads to self destruction these elements were also very omnipresent in breaking the waves and dancer in the dark the movie is also full of cynical even humorous undertones about the role of the germans and americans in post war germany as a technical achievement the movie is wonderfully designed shifting and fading washed out colors screen overlays action on different overlays with the shooting of the soon to be mayor as the most interesting in this movie we can see how good von trier s handles film as a technical medium in his later works he seems to step down from this as if he is not longer interested in technical achievements because they become so easily available
after gorging myself on a variety of seemingly immature movies purchased on ex rental dvds i figured that the time was right for a little serious drama and who better to provide it than sam mendes for a number of reasons american beauty doesn t appeal to me as much as this film which is easily the darkest thing that tom hanks has ever done and probably one of the most underrated films of the last decade for this is not a simple gangster tale lifted from its graphic novel origins and is simply wonderful to watch because of it and despite my usual allergy to any film with tom hanks name on it still can t watch big without wanting a cat to kick i m glad i gave this a try because this is one of those movies that you ll kick yourself for if you miss it normally squeaky clean hanks plays michael sullivan a devoted family man and father of two sons growing up during prohibition in the early s he is also a professional hit man to mob boss john rooney paul newman but has managed to keep his job a secret from his sons but after his eldest tyler hoechlin witnesses his dad involved in a mob killing the pair are forced to go on the run as john seeks to tidy the matter up soon father and son are pursued to chicago where a fellow hit man a menacing jude law is waiting for them on the face of it it reads like a pretty standard gangster film but as i ve said this isn t really about gangsters at all it s about the relationship between a father and son thrown together in the most tragic of circumstances hanks is grits teeth superb as the tortured man who finds out that everything has its price and little hoechlin is also good as sullivan s son in all honesty there is not a single performance that i could single out as weaker than the others the cast is pretty much faultless as is the cinematography and costumes and it s not often i praise costumes which recreates the s with stunning effect there has been so much effort to get everything right and it pays off in spades this could easily have looked rubbish they admit that the early s look was difficult to put down but it doesn t and that deserves every bit of credit chicago especially looks fantastic lined with hundreds of rickety cars from the era and filled with people in monochrome suits and hats true time travel even if a little cgi is needed the story is also a winner offering a human face to what is often seen as a stereotypical genre of movie villain law is surprisingly menacing as the almost mechanical killer maguire and proves that you don t have to be cagney or de niro or brando to play a gangster the film is decidedly noir ish driving rain and ill lit warehouses predominate but at least violence and killing are finally seen to have an emotional and psychological impact on those who perpetrate and those who merely witness such acts the whole thing is evocative of a previous age and previous movies but it sweeps away the old and refreshes with a modern tale of redemption amid the tommy gun shootouts and extortion rackets it can feel a little slow in places especially if you re used to masses of gun play in movies like most modern audiences like yours truly but sometimes words can speak louder than actions mendes has delivered a fine follow up to his oscar winning debut a film which is as intelligent as it is beautiful to watch road to perdition may not be to everyone s tastes but this is one dvd i shall not be exchanging anytime soon
according to the book the last of the cowboy heroes which is about joel mccrea audie murphy and randolph scott the author says that albuquerque was the only film he personally did not review because he claimed it was lost hadn t been seen in years good thing for western fans somebody was doing some spring cleaning at paramount because a print was apparently found and now it s out on the open market albuquerque is a pretty good western too with scott involved in a family feud with uncle george cleveland george cleveland sends for his nephew randolph scott with the intention of making him part of his freighting business headquartered in the fast growing settlement of albuquerque cleveland is more than just a business owner he s the town boss which he runs from a wheelchair he even has the sheriff in his pocket randolph scott is not a cowboy hero for nothing that includes not backing relatives up when they re villains he goes to work for a rival outfit headed by brother and sister russell hayden and catherine craig cleveland is full of all kinds of tricks and he even sends for a western mata hari in the person of barbara britton to worm her way into the confidence of his rivals barbara s great as the homespun vixen who develops her own agenda randolph scott s original home studio was paramount it was where his first studio contract was with albuquerque marked the last film he ever did for paramount and they gave him a good one note also lon chaney jr who is george cleveland s chief henchman a rather loathsome bully of a man and gabby hayes who is just gabby hayes albuquerque must have been loved by republicans across the nation in with its chief villain as a town boss who rules from a wheelchair a certain democrat from a wheelchair had made hash of them for four straight presidential elections and he was gone they had high hopes of winning the white house that year too but things went awry and they had to settle for an ersatz boss getting his comeuppance in albuquerque i m not sure why cleveland was in a wheelchair since nothing was really made of it in the plot my guess is he was injured and played the part that way because he had to still albuquerque must have had great appeal to the gop market
just saw the movie and the scary thing was the people talking during the movie sounded just like the actors the movie had its moments but also lagged and was rather sick it was all meant to be a farce but once you see the pathetic lives of the people in the movie you think to yourself people like this are all around us all attempts at getting the audience s sympathy are dashed as the actors do one stupid thing after another on the plus side there are some great and funny insults i think i would wait for video but it was a good laugh warning jerry takes his shirt off during the movie not a pretty sight
a year after losing gorgeous jane parker maureen o sullivan to love rival tarzan hunter harry holt neil hamilton returns to the jungle to have another bash at winning the brunette babe s heart mixing business with pleasure he also plans to grab himself some ivory from the elephant graveyard that lies beyond the mutia escarpment tarzan s stomping ground accompanied by his slimy womanising pal martin arlington and a group of expendable bearers harry finally arrives at his destination having narrowly avoided death at the hands of savage natives and rock hurling apes only to find that jane is still infatuated with her musclebound yodeller and worse still that tarzan is refusing to let the hunters take any ivory from the graveyard nasty arlington decides to resolve matters by ambushing and shooting the ape man and then telling jane and holt that tarzan was attacked and eaten by a crocodile of course tarzan isn t dead only wounded after being nursed back to health by cheetah he swings back into action just in time to rescue jane from a tribe of vicious lion eating savages who have attacked holt s expedition tarzan and his mate the second movie to star weismuller as the jungle man of few words is often cited by fans as the best of the series although i slightly prefer the original i can definitely understand the film s popularity it s damn sexy and there are some great action sequences the undeniable chemistry between weismuller and o sullivan is fabulous and leads to some pretty steamy scenes and with both stars wearing eensy weensy outfits throughout there s eye candy aplenty for viewers of both sexes to enjoy despite o sullivan s much touted underwater nude scene actually being performed by a body double the lovely lass still shows plenty of skin even threatening to do a sharon stone at one point as her loin cloth flaps to one side the film s most exciting moments come in the form of a wonderful underwater fight between tarzan and a crocodile and the spectacular final where jane is attacked by lions and natives but is rescued by her beau his monkey pals and a load of elephants in full on lion crushing mode once again the violence is surprisingly nasty at times although as far as i am concerned there is nothing quite as shocking as the vicious pygmies and their gorilla pit from the first film cheetah also has his fair share of excitement dodging rhinos crocs and big cats riding on tarzan s back as he crosses a river and even hopping onto an ostrich for a ride like it s predecessor tarzan and his mate does suffer slightly from some bad effects and unconvincing props dodgy back projection a few laughable monkey suits more indian elephants masquerading as their african cousins and poorly disguised trapeze swings but these shouldn t spoil your enjoyment of this very entertaining film if anything they make it even more fun out of rounded up to for imdb
this is a good movie a good family movie to watch if you have nothing else to do if you are expecting this movie to be word to word from the book you will be very very disappointed i was somewhat disappointed because i read the book a few times when i was in elementary school this is about a new kid in town named billy he makes a bet with the school bully and the bet is not like most bets billy has to eat worms in one day or the bully wins the acting is ok probably the worst part of the movie the kid actors over exaggerate on many things they think it s apocalypse if billy does not eat the worms hallie eisenberg did a magnificent job though the plot line is good as a movie but it sucks as a book adaptation i was able to watch this movie without looking at the time sometimes overall this was a good family movie with some weak points i rate this movie
the film cross eyed by adam jones propels the viewer on a ride of redemption as the main character takes back control of the wheel and sets his life in order adam jones has found an imaginative and refreshing way to empower his character and actualize what matters most these truths become apparent to both the characters and viewers as you laugh and gag to the credits with them the simple yet attractive settingscostumes keep you guessing about what you will see next you can t help but smile and laugh at the antics that take place in this movie i can t wait for his sophomore effort it is only a matter of time before jones strikes again bravo
my roommate had bought this documentary and invited me to watch it with her she s from china and only heard so much about and wanted to know the cold hard truth and she wanted me to tell her more after the documentary i felt awful watching this documentary it was like reliving the nightmare and it still brings tears to my eyes but i m extremely grateful that i watched this documentary because on the day of september th i m sure we all remember where we were and what we were doing when we heard all of us could only think certain questions why how what s going on oh my god almost all the americans were grateful for the brave firemen and policemen that risked their lives to save others but i don t think we thought about what they were really going though this wasn t actually supposed to be a documentary about the cameraman was just filming a typical day on the job and they just happened to be a couple blocks away from the world trade centers and got everything outside and in on tape on sep th i thought to myself it s ok the policemen and firemen will get the people out that survived to be honest i thought it was an accident i was in my junior year of high school and getting changed from gym and getting ready to go to my science class someone came into the locker room shouting some building just got bombed in new york we all got dressed quickly and ran to our classrooms as we watched the first tower burning on tv not only seconds later live on tv does the second plane crash into the other world trade center and we knew this was no accident a few minutes later we heard about the pentagon and that there was a plane headed for chicago but was shot down so many thoughts ran through our heads and i kept on thinking what are the firemen and policemen going to do but it s procedure to them i thought they ll know what to do the first tower collapsed we knew it so many lives are now gone the second tower crashed things would never be the same those firemen in this documentary showed courage confusion and strength the real raw human emotions they didn t know what to do they were just as scarred as those other people who were in the towers they heard the bodies collapsing on the ground from people jumping out the windows and here i was in a classroom just crying seeing all that was going on on tv i was amazed with this film and just wanted to go to new york and tell them how grateful all the americans were for their help i know they feel like they were just doing their job but they did more they were hero s every day after sep th for weeks they kept on digging knowing that there were no survivors but they kept on hoping and praying may god bless their kind and brave hearts as for my roommate she was crying and admitted this was her first time crying at these attacks she got to see the truth of what had happened that tragic day she asked why i didn t know what to say it breaks my heart that people can be that evil it sounds clique but it was a normal day for everyone one of the firemen said in the documentary no one expected this to happen not like that those people in the world trade centers or the pentagon or the planes that were hijacked they were just doing their job happen to be there or even just was there for a second passing by they were not just murdered they were slaughtered and those hijackers did it with a song in their heart then seeing in the middle east all the people celebrating why do people do this they celebrated death and the lose of mothers fathers sisters brothers friends grandparents aunts uncles cousins etc why so thanks to those people for making this documentary you truly think about the firemen policemen and the troops in iraq and it keeps your hope up that there are good people in this world thank you to all those people you are our heroes

angels in the outfield was originally a movie from the ted turner library disney remade it in this time using the california angels now the los angeles angels as the team disney used to own this and the anaheim mighty ducks hockey team also good use of the words huh this movie was about a couple of orphaned children who wanted a family a man promised the boys a family only if the angels won the pennant so he called upon god one night about this the boy who prayed could see the help coming on the way and only that boy for instance when the first angel had come down a player hit a ball so hard not only did the bat break so did the ball for much of the post all star season of the angels were at the top of the al west of which my home team the rangers is one and it still is however they lost a game because the boy was at court instead of the white sox angels game there was no central division in baseball back then hence chicago being in the west and no angels were there to help thus a new rule was created no angels can help in championship games but wait in the final championship game the angels won it was a miracle indeed what i liked about this film this is a good movie i mean i prayed every night for the last few years asking for help with school and stuff look at me now my work was good so for one this shows that if you believe god can send his angels down to help you with any troubles that you may have in life and second this is a family baseball movie which is always exciting this is an old disney movie too i ve seen this just recently on the new disney channel blech angels in the outfield will change your life forever once you ve seen it
this is a deliriously colossal vulgar silly all star extravaganza revue of all the early talkie stars that warner bros could afford and like most other rarely seen films actually made during the late s an unforgettable opportunity to see and hear the genuine roaring twenties exuberance and youthfulness put to song and dance the show of shows is pretty gigantic vaudeville act after soliloquy after tap dance after acrobat after comedian after fan dance after ukulele lunacy after rin tin tin who introduces an oriental number and on and on it lumbers grinning and squeaking away in fabulous gramophone quality vitaphone sound it is far too long but among it s delirious delights are the awesome singin in the bathtub number created on a scale of which the qe architects would be proud beatrice lillie lounging by a grand piano with some happiness boys amusingly warbling a witty ditty nick lucas and the never ending grand finale in two color color which is all set to the song lady luck so keen are the tubby chorus line and leaping teenagers to en ter tain us that they almost kick themselves repeatedly in their own faces with glee and effort row after row of doll characters hop past and some even emerge from the floor i kid you not there are even girls strapped to the crystal chandeliers mummified with shiny gauze and chained up with pearl ropes unable to move for days i imagine during production whilst this katzenjammer of toy box athleticism twitch and spasm below to the ukulele orchestra of course i loved it and had to watch this color finale over and over and then invite friends and family to the screen for weeks on end just to horrify and terrify them each separately and to roll about on the lounge in shrieking in delight at each and every exclamation of their startled reactions and so should you and rejoice that there was an era when this was created simply to entertain and thrill it is all so demented
liam neeson portrays the scottish legend robert roy macgregor from the early th century he is a true actor he captivates the audience with his charisma as he does in all his roles jessica lange is excellent as his wife mary mary is such a beautiful woman it s her love that makes rob roy the legend but it s his passion that makes her love undying they need each other tim roth as the evil cunningham is perfect in one way or another upon watching the movie you will find cunningham disgusting the scotland scenery is beautiful the environment and conditions of the times are depicted quite well if you like history romance passion and love you ll enjoy rob roy there is violence and blood but it s unavoidable in telling this story as it should be told no gratuitous violence and you do have to listen carefully if you re not used to a scottish accent one important point that makes this movie so good is that no one actor or actress is glamorized they get dirty and actually look unattractive in various scenes it s their skill as actors that attracts you they don t rely on marquee names popularity or sex symbol appeal this is something special
good show the basic background is that humanity is at a crossroads there is a set of moral dilemmas that are being faced mankind has made a number of technological breakthroughs but is mankind mature enough to deal with the its new toys there is moral decadence in a virtual world there are religious fanatics who are willing to kill to get attention i predict based on the bsg background that there will be an issue with cylons and slavery in addition to this there are all the other problems that we humans bring upon ourselves this show is not bsg at least not as far as mankind being on the run from a ruthless problem that was ultimately of their own making there are not a lot of shoot em up or space based special effects either at least not in the first few episodes i have seen so far what it does have are very good stories characters and themes it also has good performances from the actors they can make a culture which is similar to modern day society but alien at the same time be completely believable like bsg this show is about humanity our strengths weaknesses potential and flaws it may seem a little odd that a human society on a different set of worlds has neckties antique cars and chicken but those things are really more to create a semi familiar background than anything else anyone who gets stuck on those details is really missing the point whether you are from a mafia style culture or an affluent and high tech culture humans and human nature aren t that different years ago in a high tech past than what we see in the world today wonder if the writers are trying to tell us something

we all have friends some of us have more than others but there really are only one or two people that you feel really close with people that you can say are like your brother or sister alice danes and darlene beckinsale are like that you can see that from the beginning they graduated together they go to parties together and they decide to go to bangkok together when they were supposed to be going to hawaii they also get busted for attempting to smuggle drugs into a third world country and that spells disaster the rest of the film is about survival and not giving up hope it also has a strong message about the power of friendship and what it can mean to someone brokedown palace is a very good film it is not excellent and that is due to a few issues that i want to talk about but first i want to say what is good about the film and for starters the acting is top notch and you can look no further than the two leads danes and beckinsale are perfect in the roles that they have alice is always fiery and seems a little rough around the edges but she seems more fun than darlene but sometimes that fun can get her into trouble darlene is always a little on the conservative side and although that can get irritating sometimes it would have served the two girls better if her way was adhered to instead of alice s bill pullman is adequate as the american lawyer living in thailand the film is photographed very well also the inside of the prison while not the same as shawshank or natural born killers or return to paradice but it does show the necessary but underdone hopelessness of the situation that they are in johnathin kaplan s direction is quite good as well we see the two girls struggling to make it through each day but you can see their spirit is being put out a little more each day brokedown palace is excellent when it talks about friendship and it shows how they have to rely on each other to survive the other thing that i had to comment on is the soundtrack for the film it heightens and compliments the mood of the film to perfection the song that you hear in the trailer is also played in the film and when it plays you feel the plight of the women in this prison you can feel how alone they must feel and how desperate they are to get out and get back to the simple things in life and it also makes you look at yourself and realize how lucky we are to live in the society that we do we have it easy compared to some country s and believe it or not the music is a perfect catalyst for reflection on this subject some of the music is done by a group called delirium i think but it is sara mclaughlin wrong spelling but how do you spell her last name that does the lyrics and her voice is beautiful and haunting and it adds so much to the film what i didn t enjoy about the film was some of the stupidity that the girls exhibit i won t say what it is that they do but when you see it for yourself you ll know what i am talking about also i didn t really feel that the prison they were in was all that bad it looked more like a minimum security prison and that may be because when there are similar circumstances in other films that invlove men doing time in a foreign country the prison scenes are always brutal and sadistic but i didn t get that here overall this is a great film and it really does make you ask the question how far would you go for a friend that is a tough question and maybe one that none of us could honestly answer until put into the same situation let s just hope that it never comes down to that
once you pick your jaw up from off the floor from the realization that they somehow managed to put this thing together so fast that it was released the same year the case ended you ll find that it s not half bad the plot is engaging and interesting and the pacing is fast with this covering many situations and thus often jumping swiftly on to the next one after a line or two has been spoken where this really stands out is the acting the performances are excellent neill and streep are both impeccable it s also cool to hear so much australian spoken in a hollywood film and even those who don t come naturally to it at least attempt an accent the cinematography and editing are nice enough but they don t really go beyond the standard stuff this movie s story is compelling and the fact that it is authentic just makes it all the more chilling while i have not read the novel or heard of what happened outside of this picture i understand that it is quite close to the truth there is some moderate to strong language and disturbing content in this it is at times a downright great courtroom drama i recommend this to any fellow fan of such
as a forty something urban explorer photography and longtime fan of the original kolchak night stalker series since my early childhood one aspect that hasn t really been mentioned is the amount of urban exploration carl s character undertook during the series he always managed to get himself in to one great abandonment sewer or tunnel after another armed with only his trusty penlight okay so he had some flares in the primal ape episode tunnel and his camera he never carried any other gear to either protect himself or make the exploration easier like many here i recently purchased the dvd box set of the two pilot movies and subsequent tv episodes and have been slowly revisiting all the shows and although i remember watching them back in the early s when they first aired its been over years passed so many of them seem new all over again campy dated and cheesy but charming and highly entertaining they just don t make stuff like this these days now its all regurgitated spin offs with predictable characters and plots thankfully my yr old daughter has been sitting down to watch the episodes with me and has developed an appreciation for them she enjoys the genre it gives me hope and faith the series will carry on to new generations of fans for years to come
this was a fine example of how an interesting film can be made without using big stars and big effects just tell a true story about the struggles of two african american women over a turbulent century this movie challenges us all to look at our own personal prejudices and see that people are people not white black etc good movie with a good message
although lang s version is more famous borzage s work is not devoid of interest far from it its celestial sequences are even better the metaphor of the train perhaps borrowed from the ending of abel gance s la roue is eventually more convincing than the up above heavenly world borzage s tenderness for his characters shows in marie s character and love beyond the grave is one of his favorite subjects the ending of three comrades the amusement park seems to be everywhere we see it even when we are in marie s poor house i do not think that the sets are that much cheesy they are stylized to a fault the fair from a distance almost gives a sci fi feel to the movie borzage never forgets his social concerns in the heavenly train going up the rich cannot stand to be mixed up with the riffraff but as chief magistrate tells here there s no more difference not a major work for borzage neither is lang s version but to seek out if you are interested in the great director s career
sure years have passed since thalberg s last production was filmed but fellow imdb members come on this movie is surely one of the masterpieces of the s it is a this was the first movie i saw at new york s museum of modern art around i was a teenager expensive looking yet with scenes of such poverty masterfully photographed often thrilling and always engaging to me it was mgm movie making at its best what did audiences feel when they glimpsed a locust attack the person by person destruction of a mansion the horrific poverty and then the splendor of wealth last week those watching the academy awards had a glimpse of the senior oscar winner in attendance luise rainer how grand to see an actress who arguably delivered one of the most masterful haunting performances in history electing to return for a celebration ok so she should not have won the year before great ziegfeld but don t blame luise talkies were only a decade old when this was released and her dialogue limited but as olan her use of visual and vocal is memorable large scale and touching what more could a movie lover want
this is my favorite jackie chan movie and in an interview jackie said it was his favorite as well it contains some unbelievable stunts and jaw dropping fight sequences as well as some very funny scenes as well this movie was a favorite of brandon lee who used parts in rapid fire and was also lifted in tango and cash which used some of the opening scenes jackie plays a policeman in hong kong the story immediately jumps into a fantastic chase through a shanty town and continues as jackie slides down a hill and jumps onto a moving bus to catch the evil ku who is one of the greatest villains in any jackie chan movie you can expect some very funny scenes as jackie tries to balance his duty as a policeman with his girl friend played by maggie chung his job is to protect ku s secretary who has enough information to take him down but even that poses many problems jackie is at his absolute best here the last fight scene at the mall is my favorite fight scene by anyone period it was the most intense fight i have ever seen jackie do and climaxes in a slide down a pole amidst exploding lights all in all one of his greatest stunts he ever did and left him with skin pealed off his hands he was fortunate he was not electrocuted as the person in charge of the stunt used high voltage instead of a lower voltage all in all another chan classic and definitely one of his greatest movies by the end of this movie you can tell he held absolutely nothing back and neither did his stuntmen so many of his stuntmen were injured during this movie that nobody would insure them anymore jackie had to take responsibility himself there are no gimmicks wires or stand ins it is all true life action that is a treat to watch it is this type of action that made him the phenomenon that he is and it is a movie that will amaze people years from now if you have not seen this movie and are a fan of jackie chan or action in general give yourself a treat and watch this movie it is truly sensational
james stewart plays an fbi agent who began working with the agency before it was called the fbi and the story involves dealing with the ku klux klan the prohibition era gangsters world war ii german and japanese spies etc a continuously interesting picture covering years of history far superior to any films being made these days of special interest to older viewers familiar with washington dc in a scene about minutes into the movie where james stewart finds out from vera miles that she s expecting their first child the scene was filmed in herzog s seafood restaurant on the former washington waterfront the only movie in which this historic location appears shortly after taking office president kennedy decided that southwest washington a black neighborhood was an eyesore and ought to be torn down by decree befitting his position of undisputed royalty the entire area including the popular waterfront restaurant district but excluding historic churches was reduced to rubble black residents evicted from their homes relocated as best they could and without federal assistance likewise businesses were simply put out of business few re locating restaurant row was converted into a sidewalk and washington had no waterfront restaurants seafood stands boats etc for about years as a lifetime resident the herzog restaurant scene was our reason to see this fine movie again
as of this writing john carpenter s halloween is nearing it s th anniversary it has since spawned sequels a remake a whole mess of imitations and every year around halloween when they do those top scariest movies lists it s always on there that s quite amazing for a film that was made on a budget of around and featured a then almost completely unknown cast of up and coming young talent i could go on and on but the big question here is how does the film hold up today and all i can say to that is fantastically pros a simple but spooky opening credits sequence that really sets the mood an unforgettable and goosebump inducing score by director co writer john carpenter and alan howarth great cinematography stellar direction by carpenter who keeps the suspense high gets some great shots and is careful not to show too much of his villain good performances from the then mostly unknown cast a good sense of humor michael myers is one scary evil guy a lot of eerie moments that ll stay with you the pace is slow but steady and never drags unlike most other slasher films this one is more about suspense and terror than blood and a big body count cons probably not nearly as scary now as it was then many of the goofs really stand out final thoughts i want to start out this section by saying this is not my favorite film in the series i know that s not a popular opinion but it s really how i feel despite that it truly is an important film that keeps reaching new generations of film buffs and just because it s been remade for a new generation doesn t mean it ll be forgotten no way no how my rating

a journey of discovery this film follows the lives of one family living in a sleepy island town in british columbia languorous and dreamy the inhabitants are satisfied to allow life to go on around them until a young fresh faced teacher with new ideas arrives and brings with her life from the mainland slowly their indolent state is awakened the father and principal of the local school looks for excitement the mother for stability the oldest daughter for love and the youngest for power while not an incredible or ground breaking piece of cinema the movie is quietly enjoyable and good for a tired night when the wind is blowing unfortunately i doubt anyone outside of canada will find it easily accessible
allen and julie move into a cabin in the mountains after their daughter is murdered one night no one knows who killed the little girl but it s why they moved to the mountains so the couple moves into this cabin and it s haunted by people who killed themselves there and no one in the nearby town wants to talk about it this movie has a lot of creepiness to it and it has a lot of parts that made me jump some of the parts are predictable but once in a while there is a part i didn t expect it was a pretty good movie that wasn t the scariest movie in the world but it was still scary enough to make it pretty good i also liked the ending because it left the viewer to decide how it ends it is also kind of a sad movie as well but a well done horror movie
i ve read a lot of comments about the film and how it s so hard for people to believe that it is a sequel to henry fool and even though it technically is i think that fay grim needs to be looked at as an entirely different film just because it is the sequel doesn t mean that it has to be a direct continuation of the first and i enjoyed that so much about it the whole point of the film was to change direction from the first which makes sense because the movie isn t called henry fool it s fay grim all that aside the film i thought was so well made and thought out that it actually surprised me i was expecting to rent another nearly released straight to video film and have to endure hours of bad editing and an almost hard to follow story line aka parker s last direct to video feature the oh in ohio but this was so surprisingly well focused that it almost doesn t seem so which i absolutely loved there are so many nuances in the film making and writing that i crave to see in films but never do the cinematography was brilliant due to it s simplicity and truly making the film seem grim throughout in terms of setting the writing was so well put together as well whoever said this movie isn t as witty as henry fool needs to watch again and actually listen i almost can t even begin to explain how actually hilarious it was and pertinent and well parker posey who could complain the scene in which fool and jalal were talking in the dark was so captivating and emotional and i thought the spy ness throughout the film was just so hilarious and spot on in hindsight because i do agree that at times during you kind of felt lost the main thing that struck me so powerfully about the film and i believe the point of the film was parker s love and naivety about fool which was so endearing and turned yes very quickly from denial to outright passion the last five minutes of the film were perfect obviously there were things that weren t excellent but nothing is perfect some of the acting was poor and at times i did think that some of the new back story and dialogue about terrorism got a little hard to follow and out of hand but in the end you got it and didn t even mind that at the time it may have slipped from your comprehension this may also have to do with goldblum s tendency to talk extremely fast on the whole i would say that it was probably one of the best films i ve seen this year stylistically pleasing clever and witty writing performances that were so impressive i now have gained new respect for some of the actors and a truly touching film and don t forget a complete departure from fool which was the point
love it love it love it this is another absolutely superb performance from the divine miss m from the beginning to the end this is one big treat don t rent it buy it now
although this film is somewhat sanitized because it was made at a time when people just didn t talk about sex it is an extremely helpful short film to show prepubescent girls so they know what to expect during menstruation not surprisingly it was paid for by the kotex company though what may surprise many is that disney made this film as they made a lot of educational films during the s s however well made the film is though i think the film maker s missed a real opportunity instead of the nice female narrator s voice and the relatively bland visuals it would have been great if they d used minnie mouse and the rest of the disney gang i know this would have given old walt a heart attack but wow that would have been a great film by the way although the notion of sex is barely hinted at in the film it does adequately explain menstruation in general however it does lack some details especially about intercourse that i assume were included in the accompanying booklet now if only i can figure out why i watched a cartoon about menstruation
paul grace hartman are my husbands grandparents they were both deceased when we met so watching old movies is a good way to see them and their work i have always enjoyed old movies and was very happy to discover that this was also a very good one
bread very sharply skewers the conventions of horror movies in general and night of the living dead in specific and is constantly inventive the production values are a little rough at times it s a student film after all but it never loses sight of its goal to entertain hey george romero liked it enough to include it on the remastered dead video tape laserdisc and dvd that should tell you something
secret of the lens is perhaps a pretty campy all time favorite of mine the best and funniest from kajawari yoshiaki who is known for splatter anime and sleazy hentai ecchi anime i wish he did more campiness like this my favorite scenes are the psychedelic cg sequence the parts where lord helumis blows up his failing henchmen the party riots that bill causes one of the funniest scenes and whenever my favorite character worsle appears check this out warning this is not for serious sophisticated anime fans
i saw this with few expectations and absolutely loved it bend it like beckham is a fairly typical coming of age movie about a fairly atypical girl this is parminder nagra er s breakout role playing jess a teenager in england who is caught between her traditional indian family and her love of football that s soccer to us north americans and even though she s actually much older than her character she plays the role pitch perfect this is a movie about friendship specifically jess s friendship with jules keira knightley her teammate who is also going through family issues especially with her mom who wears purple nail polish and little bows on her shoes and who wants jules to be more feminine wear lacy underwear and flirt with boys and is terrified that playing sports means her daughter is a lesbian jules and jess both love playing the game and have issues trying to convince their families to let them go after their dreams they also unfortunately both love the same man joe their coach played by jonathan rhys meyers the love triangle causes some strain in their friendship in some spots bend it like beckham falls into clich s in others scenes drag on far too long and this movie probably could have benefited from overall tighter editing but this was a refreshingly fun film about growing up culture clash and the love of football it s about female empowerment chasing your dreams and supporting your friends funny charming and fun bend it like beckham is the little film that could and did excellent
wes craven has been created a most successful killer thriller movies of all time after watching he s movies you will find your new fears people don t know which wes craven s thriller movie is the best because they all different in this movie lisa is terrorize by fellow traveler he coercible her to kill and if she don t do this jack will kill her father lisa is in the huge mess because whatever she choose she will kill acting was unreal rachel mcadams and cillian murphy acted unbelievable good the emotions was in right choose idea and script of this movie is great too sometimes it reminds a scream but he definitely better than both screams sequels together and what can i say this is the best killer thriller movie in s century yet
i had read an article about dan jansen s olympic and personal journey before seeing this movie i m always intrigued by a story of hope and overcoming life altering events and this was no exception the background of the characters that is provided gives you a sense of the family s closeness and how they positively affected each others lives i can t speak to the accuracy of specific details in this movie it is customary to take some creative license when organizing a script however the spirit of dan and his family is what matters here its a worthwhile movie of a story that should be told i felt empathy for the characters and cheered at the end
now many would think to stay away from this movie just because of the title if you do not have the stomach for gory movies then what are you doing reading this review anyhow i borrowed the video from a friend of mine and fell in love with this movie immediately this movie is chock full of wonderful gore plus the usual other ingredients that make up a b movie add up to one hell of a viewing experience if you re a lover of good quality experiences then by all means watch this great flick
when i was a kid it was lex barker s time as tarzan i often heard from older people that johnny weissmuller was tarzan and i wouldn t understand why since i saw a couple of weismuller s last films in the character and i thought he was sort of out of shape it wasn t after many years that i came across tarzan and his mate and then i understood weismuller is in shape in this picture and has the presence and rugged looks the character demands not matched yet by other tarzans such as barker gordon scott jock mahoney denny miller miles o keefe and cristopher lambert as for this film i was also surprised by the sensual presence of beautiful maureen o sullivan a strong self minded active and no inhibitions woman as jane way ahead of the times in which the film was made tarzan pushes her into a pond naked as she is amused one of the explorers kisses her by surprise and though she doesn t kiss him back she sort of let him do for a bit and makes no big deal out of it such behaviors were unthinkable with the janes to come such as brenda joyce vanessa brown virginia huston or dorothy hart all playing sort of too perfect sweet vulnerable women making it hard to believe they could survive in a hostile place like the african jungle o sullivan character s sparkling personality steals the show out of tarzan himself except of course when it comes to action and weismuller takes the lead easily the combination is perfect another highlight in the movie is cheeta s secondary role and not as the main lead like in later tarzan pictures where she often saves the day tarzan and his mate stands as a fine product in its genre tarzan films and perhaps as the best though i have to admit that i also enjoyed tarzan s greatest adventure made with a higher budget and a strong supporting cast and in spite of the just acceptable gordon scott in the leading role with his too perfect all gymnasium physical looks that doesn t fit for a rustic ape man good for jane and her mate
dont read any plot summaries because in words the plot might seem trivial brain dead and pointless the film is excellent the acting by both denzel and dakota she will go sky high trust me on that are just fabulous and the plot is mind blowing actually fabulous is a small word to use for such talented actors the film is just based on actual facts and some characters are not fictional a fact that adds up to the shock that i was having during and after the film if you are fond of both actors and of somewhat deranged films you still haven t watched your favorite one yet trust me in the end you will have a weird and inexplicable feeling the film is awesome see it rent it buy it or whatever just don t miss it
this is a very good under rated action drama and slightly historical movie the basic story concerns rob roy s borrowing of pounds its theft and the problems it causes for his family and indirectly his clansmen cunningham tim roth is an amazing villain and character in this story brutally cold and if you watch his face he seems to be able to turn his eyes off and look completely evil rob roy liam neeson is excellent too but i think the writers used the word honour too many times the rest of the cast is strong and the whole movie is very well acted and filmed the action is exciting and the sword play very realistic but not too gory the story is good and you really want rob to win all in all just shy of a classic
gene kelly came up with some really grand ideas for musicals while with mgm here he s at the top of his creative powers working with the arthur freed musical unit hard to believe when you watch an american in paris that the players never left the back lot at mgm the magic of an american in paris is due to the creative editing under the direction of vincent minnelli and the sets that mgm designed blended with some background establishing shots the idea of the film originated with kelly who wanted simply to do a film with a lengthy ballet sequence involving george gershwin s tone poem an american in paris it sounded good to arthur freed who approached ira gershwin who said fine with him as long as they used other gershwin material gershwin got the kind of deal for gershwin music that irving berlin normally got not one note of non gershwin music is heard in an american in paris listen to some of the background music and you will hear things like embraceable you and but not for me which are not real musical numbers another guy who was a fair hand at writing lyrics alan jay lerner wrote the story which admittedly is a thin one all about an ex gi played by gene kelly who after world war ii never left france just settled into an apartment on the left bank and proceeded to become a starving artist he lives with eccentric composer oscar levant and does that ever sound like a redundancy two women are interested in him another expatriate american played by nina foch who wants to sponsor him as a painter if he ll reciprocate in other matters but kelly falls for a shop girl played by leslie caron in her film debut caron also has musical comedy star georges guetary interested in here of course the plot is just an excuse to sing and dance to the music of george gershwin an american in paris happens to be the first film i ever saw as an in flight movie on the first airplane trip i ever took i still remember flying back from phoenix arizona to kennedy airport seeing gene kelly doing i ve got rhythm my favorite number in the film however is tra la la which kelly sings and dances all over the apartment with oscar levant playing the piano at one point kelly dances on top of the baby grand piano in a book about arthur freed i read a quote where he said in the american in paris ballet sequence was to be done with the background of the french impressionists which he felt the public would take to rather than a realistic setting on the streets or back lot so it happened that way kelly had done lengthy ballet sequences in words and music the pirate and on the town but this one topped them all still does in my opinion and that includes some of gene kelly s later films in a surprise upset at the oscars an american in paris was chosen best picture for beating out the heavily favored a streetcar named desire i guess fantasy trumped realism that year big budgets also have an upper hand in these things as well still an american in paris is one of the best movie musicals ever done and since the studios no longer have all that creative talent under one roof something less likely to be repeated
caution may contain spoilers i ve seen this movie times i ve liked it every time upon seeing it again i m always reminded of how good it is an hbo tv movie very well done like most of their movies are this would ve gotten oscars for it s performances had it been released for general distribution instead of made for tv as i m sure anyone knows from reading other reviews here this is the story of serial murderer andrei chikatilo he murdered people over years in the former soviet union victims were buried couldn t be found so he was only convicted of out of of his murders the story actually focuses more on the forensic analyst victor burakov played to perfection by stephen rea a man that becomes tortured and obsessed with finding this killer despite the additional obstacles placed by party hacks his part is essential to be sure there is a very touching scene towards the end of the movie that mentions how in america investigators are routinely taken off serial killer cases after months whether they want to or not due to the mental strain frustration according to this acct burakov worked for over years before getting his first break from it he followed the case to its conclusion years later in this scene his superior general fetisov played by donald sutherland actually tells him he admires his dedication and apologizes for not knowing he should ve given him a break sooner rea s performance is so well done he doesn t overact chew up the scenery or do anything that distracts from his portrayal of a man who is hell bent on finding his killer he is a man with passion but doesn t show it in the same manner as is so usually portrayed in detective movies he only occasionally gives outbursts after quietly putting up with more than most could stand under such circumstances rea does so much with his face his eyes he doesn t need to overact he just is his character so frustrated after so long at one point driven to frustration he actually says he d rather find at one time than none in a year of course what he means is not that he wants more people to die he just wants some clues to catch this man rea makes us feel for this man he makes us understand but a glimpse of what it is to live with such horror and futility a mutant to be sure chikatilo s childhood was one which produces such monsters the character of chikatilo is very well done by jeffrey demunn he somehow impossible though it may seem elicits some modicum of sympathy for himself perhaps he is the worst of us gone terribly wrong either way his performance is very well done donald sutherland as colonel fetisov later promoted to general also does a great job he starts out seeming to be a cynical worldly official that doesn t seem much more interested in helping the investigation than anyone else blocking burakov but he eventually becomes more than just an assistant he actually actively participates in helping burakov there is also a very nice turn by max von sydow as the psychiatrist brought in to help profile and figure out what kind of deviant they are looking for although this movie deals with a morbid grotesque and violent story it really is more about what it takes to catch a killer than the killer himself all around a very well done movie with fine performances and a great screenplay the screenplay manages to do what the best of this type of movie does give factual events place them meaningfully inside a dramatic framework that makes you feel like you know the people behind the facts out of stars
this is not only one of the greatest jackie chan films but also one of the greatest kung fu movies of all time we ve come to expect crazy stunts and fast creative action in chan s movies and this one set the benchmark for others to follow it s two hours of pure entertainment that impresses all the way through as well as the superb action we have a viable storyline and believable characters with chan taking what appears to be a more western approach to the writing mixing eastern resolution methods ie kicking ass overall it s funny serious entertaining and groundbreaking a must for any kung fu fan whilst at the same time remaining accessible to the wider reaches of the film community
trawling through the sci fi weeklies section of the local video rentals store i was losing hope of finding any good movies i hadn t yet seen renting cypher was like a punt on a possibly very lame horse my son is so jaded with current b science fiction that he hasn t bothered seeing this yet it must be noted i didn t see anything about cypher when it was released in australia it must have been very quiet or i just missed it well this was a really pleasant surprise this is also no b movie it s not a blockbuster of the epic variety and doesn t try to be more a quiet movie that needs to be seen several times for it s plot to be fully savoured the special effects are powerfully presented when they are used my only complaint is the super helo is a leetle obviously cgi at first view but they get it right at it s nd appearance that aside everything else is top notch in any case the affects are secondary i won t give anything away about the plot the plot structure has a russian doll aspect a little reminiscent of basic instinct though with very different content just i will say that choosing jeremy northam for the lead was a master stroke the actor was born in cambridge england and his accent for this film hits the ear as a sort of extremely forced new england dialect it s a tad off key see the final twist of the plot and you ll see why that is such a brilliant choice and lucy liu is also just right with her will she kiss me will she shoot me edge i rarely watch movies several times within days this is one of them
i m surprised how many people give this move less than stars but they just don t understand the movie the story is about growing up in a difficult situation there is a crazy grandmother who really wants the best for your grandchildren and there s good reason why so many critics like this movie and the reason is because they understand the movie i feel sorry for the low scores given by some people i wish i could just write a brief summary of a movie but imdb requires you to write lines i frankly don t have anything else to say

spoilers the film sniper is undoubtedly based on the exploits of legendary us marine sniper carlos gunny hathcock the unassuming soft spoken mister rogers look alike who ran up a score of as much as confirmed and unconfirmed vietcong and north vietnamese military kills during his two tours in nam which shows just how deadly and effective a trained military sniper really is tom berenger is cool clam and deadly as sgt thomas beckett who s at the end of his career as a top us marine sniper but who later in the movie realizes that a life as a civilian will be pointless since there s nothing outside for him to do with his skills that he learned in the us marines unless he decides to become a mob hit man backett reluctantly accepts his fate as a lifetime professional killer for his country the story of the film sniper is focused on sgt beckett with the assistance of former sharp shooting silver medalist and us government agent richard miller billy zane being sent deep inside the panamanian jungle the two snipers are to take out rebel general miguel alveraze frederick miraglittoa and colombian drug king pin raul ochoa carlos alveraze who s supporting him in a planned a military take over of the country we see earlier in the movie sgt beckett scope and take out a rebel leader which i feel was the best scene in sniper for it shows step by step how sgt beckett with the help of his spotter cpt papich aden young does his job there s also a sub plot that was later aborted in the movie about a rebel sniper desilva eward wiley who was stalking beckett and who later killed papich as they were both waiting to be lifted out of the jungle by a military helicopter you would have thought that a deadly cat and mouse was being played out between the two that would culminate when the movie ended but sgt beckett had no trouble at all in dispatching desilva early in the film by using an unsuspecting miller as bait what hurt the movie the most was ironically the last fifteen or so minutes when the story went from a one shot one kill sniper movie to a rambo like ending with sgt beckett and agent miller fighting off an entire battalion of rebels with bullets flying as thick as a london fog sniper is still well worth watching for the fact that it tells the story about a person who until now has not really been glamorized in war movies a solitary killer who kills with the precision and skill of a master diamond cutter or accomplished neurosurgeon and who does it in total secrecy
i felt a great joy after seeing this film not because it is a master piece but because it convinced me of that the portuguese cinema became really very good we can see here the best portuguese actores in this field
if you re a fan of gothic horror then you re definitely absolutely guaranteed to love this wondrous italian s film castle of blood we re really talking about creepily creaking doors eerie portraits that appear to be moving spontaneously dying candles although there s no wind and smoke coming from underneath heavy wooden chamber doors speaking in terms of atmosphere and style this masterful piece of gothic film making is one of the best out there just one tiny league below landmarks such as black sunday the three faces of fear and curse of the crying woman the prominent directors duo sergio corbucci the great silence django and antonio margheriti cannibal apocalypse killer fish are successful in all areas including a powerful plot one that is genuinely nightmare inducing ultra sinister scenery and filming locations stylish black and white photography spine chilling music and a brilliant gathering of talented performers barbara steele starlet of the aforementioned black sunday and italian goth muse number one shines brightly again as a spiritually tormented character and she s literally surrounded by excellent co players one of them silvano tranquilli even gives away a fairly credential depiction of author edgar allan poe the story involves him and another wealthy visitor of a countryside tavern challenging a brutal young journalist to accept a morbid wager if he alan foster would survive spending one night in the infamous blackwood castle he receives the astonishing reward of and a newspaper interview with poe needless to say the ordeal is much more dangerous than it sounds even for somebody like alan foster who s a firm non believer in ghosts and vampires the night starts out great for him as he even meets up with the stunningly beautiful woman of his dreams but gradually he learns that blackwood castle is a hellish place where the ghosts of the previously deceased visitors are trapped for all eternity i don t know about you but this is seriously one of my favorite horror movie premises of all time co director antonio margheriti clearly was proud of this film as well because he remade it himself a couple of years later as web of the spider that movie had a handful of trumps like for example the casting of no less than klaus kinski in the role of edgar allan poe but in general this original is vastly superior castle of blood literally oozes with atmosphere and maintains a thoroughly unsettling ambiance throughout this truly is one of the rare films that can make the hair on your arms and back of the neck rise with fear if you watch it in the right circumstances watch it late at night preferably alone and in a candle lit room and you ll get an idea about the true definition of horror
i think charlotte gainsbourg is one of the best performers in the world i can t understand why some people say she s not boring maybe the one who said she s boring is because he she is boring she s a great actress and the movie was excellent it has lots of wonderful ideas and very good performers the direction was great i imaging myself in the french environment with all the sophistication and perfume flowers churches problems etc when she goes to the sister s shop is simply amazing everything s great we have a very good actress wonderful for long time alain chabat and bernadette lafont are perfect i like him more than in his next movie la science des r ves and eric lartigau did a very good work ana
ok ok don t get bent out of round i was kidding bustin out is actually a better and truer title anyhoo racism and crime dramas get the satiric treat meant from our x rated animator friend ralphie boy and he does one of his better jobs here on the crime front it shows the truth they build it defend it then boredom and stronger rivals cause them to maybe lose it see for yourself to see what goes down racist i don t know with scatman rip and the love walrus also rip being black and the main point of view i saw it as an attack on racism mostly the fact that richard pryor liked it says as much as well and the younger pre miami vice phil mike thomas in there was a nice surprise it s an animated blacksploitation film that s a good thing done well and well done it will make some squirm like the lynching scene but unfortunately that s based on fact but ralphie really should have re thought that title
i came to nancy drew expecting the worst because of everyone else s bad reviews i thought even though i don t read the books that doesn t look anything like the nancy drew i ve heard of but i was wrong sure it wasn t a carbon copy of the books but when you make a movie out of something you have to modify it to become big screen entertainment the plot was enjoyable and thrilling with a lot of actual scares and i thought that emma roberts was really believable in her own way of portraying this classic character there were several funny moments and on the contrary of many statements at no point in this film does nancy come off as a ditz she was intelligent conservative polite and genuine one thing this movie also did well was balance the whole thing out with a mix of comedy romance suspense and heartfelt moments i loved this movie what a flick what a flick and if you are wise and decide to trust me and go see this be prepared for some scary as heck moments because i was like freaking out go see it or be a bum bum and just let other people decide what you think of this movie for you a mistake i almost made i love it i wanna own this movie i love emma roberts now too she s like a mini bree van de kamp from dh love it love it
i had watched several days film shooting of this movie that summer the end result was just two scenes in the movie the location was sylvan lake in the black hills bring the wagon stop the wagon etc so this dakota youth looked forward to seeing the movie and was not disappointed the local buffalo herd was being culled so the shooting scenes were for real yes doris animals were hurt during filming i think the ending was copied by jack nicholson in the shining a great western social comment from the s this should be in the same class as high noon for real western drama or used as a social statement like blackboard jungle or rebel without a cause was for s youth
i don t think most people give this movie as much credit as it deserves i love low budget horror movies and this takes the cake especially for originality yes the scarecrow is a kung fu fighting frightner but why not no one else is willing to go that far i really haven t had this much fun watching a movie since candyman so the town picks on this one kid calling him scarecrow even his mom doesn t care about him then he gets killed and the spirit is infused with in the scarecrow who then goes on a killing spree his demise is relatively easy to assume once the movie gets going the dedications at the end go straight to a bunch of horror directors but with most dedication towards dario argento really struck me as cool these folks who wanna make movies of a newer genre over the movie has a lot of arnold rip offs with one liners you ll definitely laugh at like stick around and he kills the sheriff with a stick i would say grab a pizza some friends an laugh your a off with this movie i love it for its originality most fun
cat soup has two hello kitty type kittens embarking on a bizarre trip through the afterlife where anything can happen and does this mind tripping asian short uses no dialog substituting word balloons instead there is no way of describing this demented cartoon except to tell you to see it for yourself and make sure no one under is in the room dismemberment and cannibalism and cruelty and savagery and sudden death and callous disregard for others are common themes honest perhaps the most memorable image is that of an elephant composed of water that the kitties swim through and in and also ride but like practically everything else in this film that silly picaresque interlude soon comes to a horrible end
i love bed knobs and broomsticks so much that it makes me cry a thousand tears of joy every time i have the magnificent pleasure of seeing it i would also like to reiterate the simple fact that i love it so much too much some have said i have copies on video and i love them all equally i also love anyone else who loves it i love you my favourite scene is the dance scene at portobello road i have learned the dance moves and practice it everyday i have some audio recordings of myself singing the song if anyone can play the drums or guitar i am thinking of forming a bed knobs and broomsticks band i hope to call it the knobs love me liz
ship ahoy was probably made in order to showcase mgm talent the film is a fun trip on an ocean liner on its way to san juan puerto rico at the time in which the country was involved in wwii this was typical fare for the studios which gave the movie going public light weight entertainment as a distraction during those difficult times the country was living the beautiful eleanor powell is seen at her best in some musical numbers where she clearly shows us she was a dancer to be reckoned with red skelton is also seen in a straight part with not too much clowning as he pursues the beautiful ms powell on the ship that is bringing them to puerto rico the irresistible bert lahr has good opportunities in the film to show he was a funny man also virginia grey is seen as a fun girl who is not fooled by anyone there are good musical numbers featuring tommy dorsey and his orchestra in which one sees among others the amazing buddy rich who has a few solos with mr dorsey and ms powell a young frank sinatra appears also as the lead singer of the band backed by the pied pipers this is a nostalgic trip that should be savored by fans of this genre which mgm totally controlled
you think you ve had it tough you should check out this film carl brashear is the epitome of courage and determination what this man had to go through to become a navy diver should be an inspiration to us all and significantly after seeing this film i learned that what is shown is not even the half of it cuba gooding jr does some of his best work to date as brashear de niro as usual is good as the southern redneck who trains him george tillman in only his second major feature after soul food has made a quantum leap as a filmmaker if you want to be moved and inspired you definitely need to check out this one
we have high expectations with this one because its zombi the official sequel to zombi and directed by lucio fulci however its co directed by bruno mattei from night of the zombies and not written by dardino sachetti but by claudio fagrasso night of the zombies and its shot in the phillimines like night of the zombies and resembles night of the zombies hell of the living dead a lot as a result its more like a companion to hell of the living dead than zombi fabrazio deangelis who produced zombi and its editor tomassi and efx gianetto de rossi gave zombi its magic zombi is not magical its like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich without the peanut butter but over the years i ve grown to accept zombi i could swear i saw a version where a soldier was bitten on the arm and went to the hotel room there was a senseless fulci cut and the mattei fulci cut is the one on dvd
such a long journey is a well crafted film a good shoot and a showcase for some good performances however the story is such a jumble of subplots and peculiar characters that it becomes a sort of jack of all plots and master of none also western audiences will likely find the esoterics of the rather obscure parsee culture a little much to get their arms around in hours recommended for those with an interest in india
i don t know how anyone could hate this movie it is so funny it took a unique mind to come up with this storyline it s not your typical alien movie these aliens are so stupid and confused you need to rent it at least once
i am very sorry that this charming and whimsical film which i first saw soon after it was first released in the early fifties has had such a poor reception more recently in my opinion it has been greatly underrated but perhaps it appeals more to the european sense of humour than to for example the american maybe we in europe can understand and appreciate its subtleties and situations more since we are closer to some of them in real life particular mention should be made of the limited but good music especially the catchy and memorable song it s a fine fine night which was issued separately on an hmv rpm record inch plum label i think in the fifties i would urge anyone interested to give it a try if you get the chance you may have a pleasant surprise
at last a decent british comedy that isn t centred around some mockney bank robbers or spun off from a tv series john ivay s film is a psychoactive tale of discovery dressed in biker gear the three protagonists are gentle fools with a penchant for failure and each at a turning point in their lives giving a sensitive emotional trio of sub plots to sew the riotous comedy together the chemistry between the three amigos is palpable and makes for a touching companionship with hilarious dialogue and some classic comedic moments it feels part withnail and i part american werewolf in london and part quadraphenia but only because of the bike gangs and phil daniels in fact phil daniels lovable rogue reminds you of danny the dealer in withnail and i with his scholarly approach and scientific commitment to drugs this is a great film particularly for those who ve dabbled in psychoactive substances in the past who will relate to many moments in the film a personal favourite is the brilliant scene in the welsh corner shop buying munchies while tripping on shrooms this gentle comedy will warm the cockles of your heart and have you laughing out loud and you don t have to ride bikes or even like them to enjoy it but it ll add to it if you do brilliant
this is one a most famous movies of the french sexual empowerment of the seventies starring gerard depardieu and patrick dewaere in extremely sarcastic roles it is also one of the many dark psychological dramas of the seventies eighties such as serie noire buffet froid beau pere all realized by blier however i would like to correct the previous comment that was posted on the movie the translated title in english is very far from the french version it is true that both protagonists are going places but the title in french could be literally translated by the waltz dancers which is a metaphor for the movement of the testicles
sisters in law is made by the same directors of the rather curiously fascinating divorce iranian style which was as exactly as it stated as we got a glimpse of divorce court in iran now they ve turned their attention to the court system in cameroon africa what s great about this court is that of the magistrates are women which is unusual for such a country like this anyways they deal with plenty of men used to getting their way around the women but this film is remarkable in the fact that it appears that women has made great strides in society with divorce legal and women s rights being recognized so the judges often chastise the men for behaving in a primitive way in these times not to say that the women who appear at the court get the softer treatment one of the prime focuses of the film is a case of child abuse done by an aunt the judges waste no time in lashing out at the woman with fury and who said that justice isn t served anymore with these behind the bench they often carry out maximum penalties ya you go girl
i really liked tom barman s awtwb you just have to let it come over you and enjoy it while it lasts and don t expect anything it s like sitting on a caf terrace with a beer in the summer sun and watching the people go by it definitely won t keep you pondering afterwards that s true but that s not a prerequisite for a good film it s just the experience during the movie that s great i felt there were a few strands that could have been worked out a little more but being a lynch fan i don t care that much anymore and i loved the style or flair of this movie it s slick but fresh and the soundtrack is a beauty any music lover will get his kicks out of awtwb i can assure you i ll give it out music wise out of
what if marylin monroe albert einstein joe dimaggio and senator mccarthy were to come together in a mind bending evening of relativity this delightful roman clef never uses the actual names of the characters it so thinly veils and scathingly exposes not only for the individuals they must have been but also for what they came to represent over time if you are confused by allegory or if you like your movies served up predigested and mushy you won t like this film it is a demanding opus that rewards on many levels the viewer with the intelligence to appreciate it dropping for the time being the rigorous avoidance of using the real names of the characters we see einstein about to deliver a pacifist speech to a united nations hell bent for nukes being visited by marylin monroe after filming the notorious seven year itch scene that some say led to the end of her marriage with joe dimaggio they have a lovely interplay in which einstein stumbles with suitable professorial clumsiness around the innocence of perhaps the greatest sex symbol of modern times enter senator mccarthy who thinks einstein is a red he is determined to extract einstein s assurance that he will support the activities of the house unamerican activities committee while delivering the ultimate weapon in the name of peace add joe a surprisingly fragile and vulnerable person perhaps not perfectly cast as gary busey who hates marylin s exhibitionism and believes einstein has become her lover even though marylin only wants to show einstein that she understands the special theory of relativity but there s more just like each of us these characters have their deepest fears which they reveal one by one in haunting flashbacks it is these weaknesses ultimately that lend humanity to figures we cannot help but see almost exclusively in the abstract today finally we see the shocking terror of einstein s vision and the statement of the movie becomes clear it is a powerful and memorable moment insignificance is one of my top five movies of all time it is utterly amazing
i first saw this film about years ago when my former college accounting professor recommended it to me i was amazed that a movie from could so coherently and hilariously portray computer crime maggie smith is delightful and ustinov plays the retro hacker perfectly o nolo mio
this movie scared me so bad i am easily scared though so its no big thing but this movie was scary and whoever wasnt scared by this movie im surprised because everyone i know said it was scary i hope everyone sees it but dont see it with the lights off like i did

i m one of those people who d crawl a mile through broken glass to see a hal hartley film from trust and iris to henry fool and my hartley favorite no such thing hal s unique brand of movies are an acquired taste infusing equal parts mystery espionage with wispy comedy seems to be his forte the comedy isn t in your face necessarily and often runs throughout an entire scene before coming to fruition and that s the case with fay grim the sequel to henry fool parker posey stars as fay grim abandoned wife of henry fool and mother to henry s only son ned fay lives a quiet life until she comes home one day to find a cia agent in her kitchen his name is fulbright jeff goldblum man of the year and he wants henry s notebooks there are many henry fool notebooks and they were all previously believed to contain nothing but mad wanderings apparently there s much more to them secrets weapons research or paths to terrorists who knows but henry agent fulbright tells fay that her husband is dead but this is quickly surmised as a ruse to get fay out of her home and searching for henry and it works but not the way they think fay battles multiple spy rings to gather henry s notebooks and to seek him out she also makes a deal with the cia to get her brother simon james urbaniak out of prison he d helped henry escape the country in the original henry fool film multiple overlapping events occur in rapid succession spy rings shoot each other to death henry is discovered being held in safety by a jihadist fay frees her brother but unknowingly risks her son s life and the cia gets its comeuppance for putting fay in danger hal hartley obviously loves to play with themes and he does so to the extreme here even character names grim fool fulbright fogg have implicit meanings of their own that are quite funny the over the top espionage films of ol are given plenty of screen time too as guns blaze in stop motion sequences never striking our heroine even though she s right in the line of fire now that i ve heaped praise on this creation i will say that parker posey s excessive portrayal of fay grim isn t the best part of the film which is a shame considering how much time she s on screen i realize this was probably what mr hartley wanted an uncurbed woman with hand gestures to the italian extreme but it was still painful to watch at times even so fans will probably devour fay grim and beg for more though this wasn t my favorite hal hartley film i know i m ready
since this is black history month and i m reviewing the achievements of many african americans on film in chronological order i got this movie on vhs from the library because duke ellington and his orchestra were in it their jazz version of franz liszt s rhapsody was the highlight of this mostly overlong murder mystery musical comedy mixture many other numbers i liked were kitty carlisle s especially sweet marijuana carl brisson s cocktails for two as well as his duet with carlisle on that earlier and the ones by gertrude michael who s great as the woman you love to hate jack oakie and victor mclaglen probably go a little too long with their love hate banter as the producer and detective but they grow on you and toby wing is a sexy dumb tease as nancy who keeps trying to say something to oakie but gets a not now from him every time while many of the characters have a motive for the murders that happen i wasn t surprised by the revelation of who done it and get a load of how naked the women here are though of course their breasts are covered either by their hands or some flimsy top this was very obviously pre code worth a look for any film buff interested in this sort of thing p s as a long time louisiana resident i like noting when someone was born here as carlisle was a new orleans native
i thoroughly enjoyed this film overall but four things really stand out sam raimi s perfect comic timing and performance as the camp handy man alan arkin s wonderful characterisation of the camp owner and best of all the cinematography the beautiful golden tones of the exterior scenes draws me into the film like a sunset at the lakeshore draws me into my own summer memories the dialog and mood feel very natural and believable some reviewers criticise the lack of a more profound script to me it is exactly that lack that makes this film work the characters and their problems seem real and because of that i care about what happens to them the bottom line is that all the parts come together to create a whole that feels right
featuring a fascinating performance by will smith and a story that tugs at your heartstrings harder than a rock guitarist mid solo seven pounds races past the director s previous collaboration with the actor the pursuit of happiness a flick which i also loved remember gabriele muccino s name because some of his movies may skip by unnoticed if the actor attached to the project isn t quite so high profile too bad i figured out will smith s scheme early on i put two and two together when he calls in his own suicide in the first scene and the scene when rosario dawson s character is introduced as having an incurable heart disease however i still think the writer director made the right choice putting the bookends bookends are the first and the last scene in that way it s the source of urgency and tension in the movie finding out gradually how exactly a man can be driven to that ultimate sacrifice and it was heartbreaking to see the relationship between smith s and dawson s character flourish and develop knowing in the back of the mind always what was in store for these unlucky two one of my friends with whom i saw the movie thought smith s character could have a divine gift and i understand why his performance is almost angelic when in the presence of his seven elected ones yet at other times he could be harsh and scary and when he s alone the full weight of his situation got too much for him and he breaks down completely it s quite a versatile performance lastly i can t forget to mention the crash scene re enactment which was really quite stunningly done in terms of cinematography paired with music put this on your list
this could be difficult to for some people to get into being used to hollywood production styles the directing is uninspired apparently simply a filming of the stage set up and the audio quality is bad here and there the rustling of people s clothes occasionally competes with their voices etc my friends and i started watching without knowing what to expect and the first scene almost put us off it seemed very stagy and cheesy then we picked up on the tone of the content and really started to enjoy ourselves it is very funny despite some corniness definitely give it a chance if you appreciate great dialog also helena bonham carter is adorable of course
well easily my favourite tv series ever call me a walking mail clich but include violence mafia sex gambling drugs etc on a show and you re already winning points on in my book combine all that with acting that superceeds anything you ve ever seen on the small screen add directing that fits cinema of the vintage type and most of all writing that blows the mind and a few brains a long the way and you got yourself a show thats gonna be pretty tough to compete with above all stand two actors james gandolfini as tony soprano and edie falco as his wife carmela as for gandolfini he fits his roll in a way that words cannot express if you haven t seen him as tony yet see it now i can go on and on and on about every character in the show the psychological brilliance the gripping scenes etc but you wouldn t be able to stop me so all i can say is that this is about the only show along with seinfeld that i am able to watch over and over again from start to finish and end up enjoying it even more
before dogma when lars used movies as art not just a story a beautiful painting about love and death this is one of my favorite movies of all time the color the music just perfect
an imagination is a terrible thing to waste especially when you have talented actors writer director jones wastes no time in siding the viewer with his protagonist anyone who has shared an apartment with a slob will be crying with laughter anyone who has arrived while a meter maid places a ticket on your windshield will just plain cry we ve all wanted to rip a terrible toupee off a man s head these are only snippets of what s in store when watching cross eyed a heartfelt film that should be a stepping stone for jones and his wry sense of humor both in front and behind the camera
canadian director vincenzo natali took the art house circuit by storm with the intriguing and astonishingly intelligent cube which is my personal favourite sf film of the s it framed the basic conceit of a group of strangers trapped in a maze shaped like a giant cube shot entirely on one set and took this idea in fascinating directions i ve been eagerly awaiting natali s follow up and although its taken five years for him to mount another project i m delighted to say it was worth the wait cypher is a fascinating exploration of one man s place in the world and how through a completely logical chain of events finds himself in a situation beyond his control i don t want to reveal too much about the plot because one of the joys of cypher is the different avenues it takes us down it is so refreshing in this day and age to see a sf film that has more than one idea in it s head cypher is such a film morgan sullivan jeremy northam one of the blandest people to ever walk the planet is hired by the company digicorp they send him to different parts of america to record different seminars to his bewilderment they are unbelievably boring covering topics as mundane as shaving cream and cheese while morgan is waiting for one seminar he runs into rita foster an impeccably cast lucy liu the definition of an ice maiden she gives him the brush off but there is something to her he finds irresistible that s not too surprising considering the dry marriage he is in when rita turns up at another one of morgan s seminars she tells him his life is not what it appears and i m not saying anything more about the plot to do so would cheapen the impact the rest of the film has on us as well as the tortuous path that s so much fun to follow as with cube natali shows quite a talent for encompassing seemingly ordinary people taking them out of the familiar and basically seeing what will happen when they re thrust into the unknown and cypher follows similar patterns but it s not a carbon copy of cube it has it s own inspiration cypher is a film that has more in common with conspiracy thrillers and paranoia stories one of the great things about cypher is the way these themes creep into the story without your knowledge when morgan realises his false identity is a piece of a much larger puzzle it s as much of a shock to us as it is to him one thing that distinguishes cypher from cube is how much more polished it is where cube was confined to a minimalist setting and a shoestring budget with a cast of unknowns cypher is also on a low budget but natali economises it as much as he can allowing him to broaden the horizon and launching morgan on an amazing journey through the labyrinth of his own identity natali s direction is exceptional with a deft hand on the reins there are some amazing camera angles from above such as the enormity of the digicorp building as a vast robust office block in conjunction to the insignificant speck that is morgan standing outside all the colour appears to have been bled out of the picture which compliments the tone of the film perfectly as a modern day film noir the acting is uniformly excellent throughout jeremy northam is a sympathetic figure from his loveless marriage to questioning his own identity his performance is excellent because it s so modulated he literally seems to transform right before our very eyes from a clinical spineless wimp to a confident man who will do anything to preserve his new identity david hewlett puts in a welcome appearance who made such an impact in cube he resides in a secret silo that looks like it was borrowed from men in black his scene is one of the best because it s an exercise in carefully calculated suspense and paranoia he is a supposed expert in identifying double agents and it s a fantastic piece of writing brilliantly acted by hewlett all he has to do is look at morgan and we re drawn into his complex mind game but it s lucy liu who s the scene stealer here too often she is cast in films where her potential is not utilised to full effect but in cypher she is finally given a character that fits her like a glove rita is an aloof guarded femme fatale that liu inhabits with relish i perked up every time she appeared because she is always in control and can reduce a room to silence by the power of her icy stare alone things come to a very gratifying end that doesn t conclude on an ambiguous note the way cube did but morgan deserves his happy ending after he s been put through the ringer like this i cheered for him in the final scene it s a perfect final moment because it comes as a ray of sunshine after a gloomy minutes cypher succeeds on all counts engaging shocking always entertaining it s everything that total recall wanted to be but wasn t and it comes as a refreshing antidote to the overwhelming and inexplicable matrix a fine follow up from natali and now i m a committed fan of the man superb stuff
a nice shirely temple short child actors screaming their lines seemed to be the norm for that day and time perhaps being seen and not heard needed to be made up for aside from that this is fun given the films era there are certain aspects of the thing from a social viewpoint that strike me as both very progressive and liberal i won t go into those here i d rather not spoil it for you but let you watch it for yourself and see if you spot those elements as early on as it was its easy to see from this short the fascination that was already developing for temple that makes it worth watching if you re a temple fan for others its a cool way to kill ten minutes while you re waiting for your good night glass of milk to warm up on the stove
casting jack cassidy as ken frankin was sheer brilliance cassidy personified arrogance confidence charm and wit all with a condescending evil little smirk on his face in my opinion jack cassidy is by far the best murderer having appeared three times in the columbo series this particular and first performance is my favorite columbo episode ever hands down a fresh faced steven spielberg did amazing camera work yes there were a couple of camera shadows on the actors at times capturing the nuances and banter at different and intriguing angles between columbo and franklin also the panoramic and tight in shots at big bear lake ca franklin s cabin home were very impressive if you have not yet seen this episode then you owe it to yourself to do so it s a true masterpiece jack cassidy was a very talented actor and singer his charismatic personality was highly infectious his death in at age was very sad and indeed very tragic he surely had his best years ahead of him rest in peace jack you will live on for eternity through your great work
at times this overtakes the thing as my favourite horror film while carpenter s film is the more efficient and more entertaining flick kubrick s is more artistic more thought provoking and probably scarier it s one of the few films where i can look past its flaws and truly and wholly love it i try not to compare it to the book which i ve only read once a number of years ago and which scared me to death because the two don t have a lot in common besides the story and characters obviously it s almost as if kubrick was banking on people s love of the novel in order to make his film more frightening and it that way it s certainly one of the most interesting book adaptations ever made as well as one of the greatest horror films what makes the film so terrifying is not the jump scares not the blood and gore not the various ghosts that pop up from time to time it s the destruction of jack torrence some people have complained about the casting of nicholson in this role saying that it s too obvious that he s going to go crazy in the film given his past roles and his appearance i disagree we know he s going to go crazy since most of us have read the book and jack s appearance only furthers this notion but it s the way he acts at the beginning that makes us truly scared he s calm quiet patient he engages in inane small talk with the hotel managers and even with his own family and with a wife and son as irritating as his it s a small wonder that he manages to do so but once he gets to the overlook he changes he becomes irritable angry on edge the scene that always shocks me is when wendy interrupts him typing and he utterly loses it telling her to leave him the f alone this is the first f bomb dropped in the film and it s a shock to the system from then on all bets are off another thing i love is the multiple interpretations present in the film we re never really sure if what we re seeing is actually happening many critics have noted that whenever jack talks to a ghost there s a mirror present showing that he may as well be talking to himself but what of the other characters wendy never sees anything until the film s climax until she is given a tour of the hotel s many ghostly inhabitants but she is well aware that something is wrong while danny connects with the place almost immediately his psychic powers are not in question how else would hallorann know to come to the hotel but does he ever see any of the ghosts that his parents witness it s easy to claim that jack merely loses it being trapped in a hotel with his family and wendy later does as well seeing your husband attempt to kill you with an axe will do that but what of danny it appears that his body is taken over by tony but how do we know for sure none of these characters are reliable witnesses hallorann probably would be and he warns of the dangers in but he s killed as soon as he arrives at the overlook a scare kubrick achieves by playing on the assumptions of fans of the novel and that final shot has there ever been a more enigmatic ending in cinema has jack really been there before or was his body merely absorbed into the hotel when talking about the acting in this film any discussion begins and ends with jack nicholson shelley duvall gives one of the most annoying performances in cinematic history probably on purpose to give jack s character more of a reason to snap and danny lloyd is no better but jack is a powerhouse part method part improvisation he s simultaneously terrifying and appealing for better or for worse he s the character with whom we identify with not the annoying kid or nagging wife we all want to have a hotel to ourselves for a season be able to do whatever we want who cares if it s haunted of course the technical aspects are terrific kubrick s long takes strange angles and bizarre imagery all contribute to the horror the use of colour mirrors long hallways and every other motif only heightens this and don t even get me started on that score i don t know if the film would be half as scary without that haunting electronic tune its strangeness perfectly reflects the hotel the mood and the entire film itself i know king doesn t like this film but king s input on cinema is nothing to brag about as great of a novel writer he may be his screenplays are terrible and his attempt at directing is better left unnoticed this is not a very faithful book adaptation but it doesn t need to be and it really shouldn t part of the horror of the film is that the viewer doesn t have the book to fall back on there s no reassuring source material kubrick masterfully alters the narrative to terrify the audience even more if only for that this is one of the most innovative films in any genre and it s got everything else on top of that
unlike another user who said this movie sucked and that olivia hussey was terrible i disagree this movie was amazing olivia hussey is awesome in everything she s in yeah she may be older now because many remember her from romeo and juliet but she s wonderful this story line may be used quite often but it s a unique movie and i ll fight back on anyone who disagrees i enjoyed this movie just as much as i have any other olivia hussey movie olivia s my girl and i love her work i saw this for the first time on saturday and fell in love with it not only because s it s an olivia movie but because of it s unique story line and wonderful direction
this movie changed it all for me i heard of breakdancing and hiphop but had never seen it professionally done hey i was an year old kid from holland when i saw this movie this all changed i got actively involved in the hiphop movement in our city started breakdancing and writing lyrics to this day i still consider this movie to be a personal favorite sure the filming and cinematographic importance might not be that significant but who cares if the wide shot was filmed badly or if you could see a mic hanging above somebody it s what it does to you personally that counts
but watch mary mcdonnell s performance closely her body language her fine body movements her subtle but powerfully effective reactions this is an accomplished artist at the top of her craft and the rest of the cast were pretty damned good too o this is perhaps the rd or th viewing for me and i see more in it each time what is this world coming to anyway r
watch on the rhine started as a broadway play by lillian hellman who wrote the film and saw it open on broadway at a time when the soviet union was still bound to nazi germany by that infamous non aggression pact signed in august of so much for the fact that hellman was merely echoing the communist party line the line didn t change until a couple of months later lillian was actually months ahead of her time with this work the play watch on the rhine ran from april to february for performances and five players came over from broadway to repeat their roles frank wilson as the butler eric roberts as the youngest son lucile watson as the family matriarch and most importantly villain george coulouris and paul lukas lukas pulled an award hat trick in winning an oscar a golden globe and the new york film critics for best actor probably if the tony awards had been in existence then he would have won that as well the oscar is even more remarkable when you consider who he was up against humphrey bogart for casablanca gary cooper in for whom the bell tolls mickey rooney in the human comedy and walter pidgeon for madame curie every one of his competitors was a bigger box office movie name than he was lukas s nomination is usually the kind the academy gives to round out a field jack warner knew that which is why mady christians did not repeat her broadway part and the role of lukas s wife was given to bette davis davis took the part not because this was an especially showy role for her but because she believed in the picture and just wanted to be associated with it it s the same reason she did the man who came to dinner a much lighter play than this one davis is the daughter of a late american supreme court justice who married a german national back in the weimar days after many years of being vagabonds on the continent of europe davis lukas and their three children come to america which has not yet entered the european war they re made welcome by lucile watson who is thrilled naturally at finally meeting her grandchildren the fly in this ointment are some other house guests a friend of davis s from bygone days geraldine fitzgerald and her husband who is also from europe a rumanian diplomat and aristocrat george coulouris coulouris is a wastrel and a spendthrift and he smells an opportunity for double dealing when he suspects lukas s anti fascist background his suspicions are quite correct it s the reason that the family has been the vagabonds they ve become lukas fought in spain on the republican side and was wounded there his health has not been the same since his family loyally supports him in whatever decision he makes those decisions affect all the other members of the cast adding quite a bit more to the broadway play including some lovely fascist creatures was dashiell hammett who was lillian hellman s significant other coulouris playing cards at the german embassy was a hammett creation with such loathsome types as henry daniell kurt katch clyde fillmore erwin kalser and rudolph anders coulouris is truly one of the most despicable characters ever brought to screen as the no account runmanian count he was a metaphor for his own country who embraced the nazis with gusto and then equally repudiated them without losing a step after stalingrad lucile watson was up for best supporting actress in but lost to katina paxinou in for whom the bell tolls dashiell hammett was nominated for best adapted screenplay and the film itself lost for best picture to that other anti fascist classic casablanca though it s an item firmly planted in those specific times watch on the rhine still packs a stern anti fascist message that bears repeating infinitely
i recently watched caprica again and thought i might as well come and write up a review i first saw this right after i saw the series finale of battlestar galactica being a big drooling fan boy of the show left me clinging onto anything i could of the shows universe so i didn t know what to expect but i did come out with a smile though i must admit the story starts off dramatically on planet of caprica and we are introduced with a variety of interesting characters i won t give too much away but there is a dramatic event that dictates the course of the story but i suggest you watch this must say esai morales is one hell of an actor he pulled off a young joseph adama father of the admiral in battlestar galactica i found his acting spot on and i could believe that he is the father of william adama from bsg also eric stoltz fits his role precisely special note it was good to see polly walker outside of rome don t sit down and watch caprica with the expectation of it being like battlestar galactica because the story line is pretty straight forward and anyone can watch it without having to have see bsg this show is a well written drama for those who like there drama with a bit of a sci fi kick
when i heard that adrian pasdar was in drag in this movie my expectations that i would watch the entire movie were low the only reasons i gave it a chance were the magnificent julie walters and the recommendation of a friend what i thought would be a broad mrs doubtfire type of farce turned out to be a gentle and insightful comedy pasdar is entirely credible and empathetic as the ambitious business man who needs to release the female part of his being by cross dressing on occasions he transmits these needs to the audience in a thoroughly believable fashion julie walters is magnificent is as her habit as the landlady who teaches him unconditional love
i studied charlotte bronte s novel in high school and it left me with a stunning impression here was a beautiful novel about a young woman s struggle to find love and acceptance in the dark times of victorian england this young woman was jane eyre a poor and plain character with a strong mind and will of her own her story which bronte told through jane s own eyes was both sad and inspiring as part of our study we watched the adaptation of the story and it blew me away the mini series not only made the effort to stay true to bronte s original text and the essence of the story but the actors who portrayed the characters were just great both zelah clarke jane eyre and timothy dalton jane s lover by the name of rochester captured brilliantly the essence of their characters i cannot imagine anyone else in their roles the other performances of rochester in other versions such as the version lack the passion energy and tenderness needed to portray rochester accurately i say that timothy dalton comes out on top because he possesses all these characteristics in his portrayal of rochester zelah clarke not only looks like jane eyre but she captures jane s quiet but firm and passionate nature brilliantly she holds in her emotions like the jane of the book at the appropriate moments in the story but allows her fire to come out in jane s passionate scenes the chemistry that clarke and dalton portray in their scenes together is also credible and true to jane and rochester s devoted relationship as well the supporting actors also fit their roles perfectly and the sets fit the gothic nature of the story i strongly recommend this version of the classic bronte tale if you have not read the book before then you can watch this production as a faithful introduction to this beautiful story
this is a brilliant and well made contribution by a group of fans and considering it s made in a back bedroom on a painted green screen it s story lines are complex and twisting and it s characters show realistic depth and dimension the cgi created by the crew is breathtaking while it s first season might be a little shaky it s final few are well thought out and well shot some fans might have thought that the star trek franchise had come to an end with the early cancellation of enterprise but these fans don t take no for an answer i recommend this to fans and newcomers alike hidden frontier crew make it so
okay i know this does nt project india in a good light but the overall theme of the movie is not india it s shakti the power of a warlord and the power of a mother the relationship between nandini and her husband and son swallow you up in their warmth then things go terribly wrong the interaction between nandini and her father in law the power of their dysfunctional relationship and the lives changed by it are the strengths of this movie shah rukh khan s performance seems to be a mere cameo compared to the believable desperation of karisma kapoor it is easy to get caught up in the love violence and redemption of lives in this film and find yourself heaving a sigh of relief and sadness at the climax the musical interludes are strengths believable and well done
this is a quirky movie that the brits do so well low budget cameo type roles well executed the story is a little weak a recently widowed judi dench decides to round up the blonde bombshells a all well almost all girl band who performed during the war in london the obligatory son daughter who thinks she s gone potty i did like the way the movie lets young people see that they don t have a monopoly on feelings love and even lust that the old wrinklies can have a good laugh too judi dench was superb as always a pity we didn t get to see more of the other blonde bombeshells the end was a little rushed i thought i kept thinking as i watched that david jason would have made an even better patrick than ian holm although he was quite adequate as the transvestite drummer all in all a cheery movie well worth a night in with the girls
yes the plot is predictable yes there are a few plot holes yes it has a made for tv quality and yes britney spears wrote the book with obvious self promotion but forget all of that this movie is fun fun in an after school special sort of way but fun nevertheless virginia madsen as the mother does a great job so good that i m going to start watching for her movies she reminded me of diane lane for all the good reasons the rest of the cast does a fine job too if i was a casting agent i d be scouting some of these young actors the production values are above usual tv standards and the music was really great better than several big budget movies i ve seen if you re in the mood for german noir this movie isn t for you if you want a safe fun and underrated movie this is a good one it s one you could show to your year old daughter but enjoy it yourself too
i went to see this movie expecting a nice relaxing time in the theater with my younger sister instead i had to really control myself in order to convince her that i was not scared in many ways still a children s story but with a screenplay that has a lot of potential could have been one of the scariest movies if planned for another audience
i ve noticed that a lot of people who post on the kerching board seem to hate this show which i actually find very surprising i think it s one of the best british kids shows there is it s a shame it s ending because it s very funny if a bit cheesy sometimes and has great characters the main character is a little like del boy although quite a lot smarter with his best friends he tried to make a million pounds for his mum by starting an online business and adopting a pseudonym of rudeboy his friends are seymour who likes to cook and danny who is simple minded and the comic relief character throughout the show some characters have left and new ones have come in but it s always been entertaining and improving
perhaps one of the most important and enjoyable greek films i ve seen in the last ten years excellent performances especially yiannis zouganelis is great well written script and effective direction from a very special for the greek very average standards auteur a film obviously influenced by sam peckinpah s straw dogs that could be a masterpiece if it avoided some evident and exaggerative situations and symbolizations in the end nevertheless this is a movie which deserves our attention and belongs to that rare category of greek movies which should be watched outside greece it s a shame that in greece didn t work commercially in addition with other fake and cursory big productions like politiki kouzina
first things first this isn t an action movie although there is a lot of action in it i think you can compare it to american sports movies where a team of very bad players succeed in the unthinkable winning a game or tournament beyond expectation in this case it isn t about football or baseball but taekwondo in the beginning these street thugs seem to be good for nothing but soon we will find out that they don t want to be thugs and actually achieve something in life it is nice to see them struggle and training i was surprised how funny this movie was from start till the end you will laugh your pants off the young korean actors are very convincing go see this wonderful feel good movie
a lovely little b picture with all the usual joe lewis touches people ripping up pillows and auras of lurking fear also alas an ending that comes out of nowhere because apparently the auteur has lost interest in the movie or perhaps because as a b picture it has to fit into a slot
if i sit down i will never stand up again that s what the mother the one of the title says to his son when he tells her to get some rest she s just widowed he means that resting is what a woman of his age and in her situation has to do to rest in peace to neglect herself but she s not in the mood for resting not yet she also has a daughter who reproaches her for each and every disasters in her life suddenly the revelation comes sex and passion in the figure of a muscular carpenter years younger than her daniel craig the brand new james bond when she thought nobody would ever touch her again it is a story that makes you reflect on many things specially on what s a something woman is supposed to do with her life when his husband dies it doesn t look that we ve advanced that such in those aspects i mean nobody s surprised when sean connery has a love affair in a movie with catherine zeta jones but what would you think if it was otherwise an old woman a young guy nah you ain t ready for that are you the movie has intimist tones all along its length except for or sequences in which that tones breaks and out comes some explicit and foul mouthed dialogs those vulgar touches and the way the son and the daughter find out their mother s love affair pretty absurd you ll know what i mean when you watch it are the only discordant elements in the mother my rate
definitely one of the lesser of the astaire rogers musicals it s just very poorly plotted and paced it only runs a few minutes longer than swing time for example but it feels a heck of a lot longer this is partly due to the secondary romance between randolph scott and harriet hilliard scott is rarely ever interesting i like hilliard she s sweet and i love at least one of her songs but where are you get thee behind me satan her other number is a weak leftover from top hat thankfully cut from that masterpiece follow the fleet would actually be a bad film if not for at least three brilliant dance sequences between astaire and rogers the dancing contest vies for the top spot of any of their numbers the dance is just fantastic i m putting all my eggs in one basket presents the two rehearsing a dance that they don t quite have perfected yet its imperfections make it all the more perfect and let s face the music and dance is easily one of irving berlin s best songs so the film is well worth watching for its great moments
this movie is by far the cutest i have seen in a long time wonderful animation and adorable characters even the bad guys were cute made this one a total winner in my book and also in the books of those i saw it with i still want to see it again but haven t had time better than toy story which was good too but not this good
after what was considered to be the official dirty harry trilogy with the enforcer to be the final chapter in the series dirty harry is back older more dirtier and grittier than ever since the original classic dirty harry in the past has killed a psychopath killer vigilante cops and vietnam veteran terrorists but now he s after a new killer a killer who wants payback by gunning down her attackers sudden impact brings a new meaning and more darker tone to dirty harry callahan is on a new murder case that is circling back to a woman played by sondra locke who was brutally raped along with her sister who is left traumitized ten years after she s out for revenge by gunning down her attackers at the same though callahan is on a heat of trouble by his superiors after he provokes a mob boss to a heart attack of which the mob are hunting him as well so in order to let the heat die down within the city harry is on order to take a vacation on a seaside town but at the same time the raped victim is in town as well while hunting her attackers one by one harry is on the investigation and finds the killings very similar as he homes in on the killer s trails sudden impact in my opinion has to be one of my top revenge films as well as being the second best dirty harry movie yet far better than both the enforcer and the dead pool combined sudden impact has what the original dirty harry had a dark tone with entertaining value so do you feel lucky punk
as most off you might off seen star wars return off the jedi you may knows its a good movie but as you might have seen on video they m might have a party at the end and they just probably end the movie with the party with no a spirits or anything but on the original one live tv when they are partying but before i say more when ben obi wan dies in the imperial ship or death star they saw him disappear and yoda dies from either old age or internal illness but because luke killed darth vader real name anakin skywalker when they all are partying at the end when luke or someone stops the spirits off ben and yoda stands starring at him and smiling while another spirit appears is its darth vader but not as a sith as the old usual selve off him and started smiling with ben and yoda i reckon that made the movie ending a little bit interesting but the producers or anyone should off made a spirit off padme and mace windu and other jedis that got killed with younglings under there arms in the back ground
i saw this film on true movies which automatically made me sceptical but actually it was good why not because of the amazing plot twists or breathtaking dialogue of which there is little but because actually despite what people say i thought the film was accurate in it s depiction of teenagers dealing with pregnancy it s not dawson s creek they re not graceful cool witty characters who breeze through sexuality with effortless knowledge they re kids and they act like kids would they re blunt awkward and annoyingly confused about everything yes this could be by accident and they could just be bad actors but i don t think so dermot mulroney gives when not trying to be cool a very believable performance and i loved him for it patricia arquette is whiny and annoying but she was pregnant and a teenagers the combination of the two isn t exactly lavender on your pillow the plot was very predictable and but so what i believed them his stress and inability to cope her brave yet slightly misguided attempts to bring them closer together i think the characters acted by anyone else would indeed have been annoying and unbelievable but they weren t it reflects the surreality of the situation they re in that he s sitting in class and she walks on campus with the baby i felt angry at her for that i felt angry at him for being such a child and for blaming her i felt it all in the end i loved it and would recommend it watch out for the scene where dermot mulroney runs from the disastrous counselling session career performance
inspirational tales about triumph of the human spirit are usually big turn offs for me the most surprising thing about men of honor is how much i enjoyed it in spite of myself the movie is as predictable and cliched as it gets but it works much credit goes to the exhilarating performances by both leads it s a perfect role for cuba gooding jr who s wonderfully restrained here we have come to expect a lot from de niro and he doesn t disappoint he creates a darkly funny portrait director george tillman jr set out to make an old style flick and comes up with a winner
i saw this movie years ago on late night television back then it went by the title of stairway to heaven even as a young boy i remember being deeply moved by the story and astounded by the visual effects of the court trial those who have seen it know what i m talking about such imagination a perfect blend of romance drama humour and fantasy this movie is right up there with the greatest classics ever made citizen kane casablanca gone with the wind this movie is rated extremely high by imdb voters and rightly so over voters rated it out of over rated it or higher out of i was surprised it was not listed in the top films until i realized so few have seen rated this movie compared to those on the list what a pity i hope this movie gets released on dvd for region north america so that i can purchase it and others discover this hidden treasure
kudos to fawcett to taking on roles that at the time were considered controversial to my recollection rape was still a taboo subject in the s and women s rights and emotions were rarely so deeply examined during that time fawcett is simply a woman who is followed then stalked by actor james russo he is adequate as the obsessed psychopath but at times a bit transparent diana scarwid has a bit role as does alfre woodard as the house mate woodard worries about the legal consequences when fawcett the rape victim takes revenge on the culprit the scene where she throws a frying pan of hot oil at russo is classic and as the rapist he deserves it she then keeps him in bondage and the consequences must be faced a very real story reflecting the emotions and rage of rape victims who have been violated physically and mentally highly recommended
a fascinating look at the relationship of a single father in and a single mother in tied together by a time traveling teenager reminded me of somewhere in time richard matheson s bid time return as rendered by christopher reeves and jane seymour
being someone who lists night of the living dead at number three in her top five favorite movies of all time and at the same time loving this student film parody i feel i must defend this movie against the previously posted scathing reviews this short but sweet opus has always been a crowd pleaser at horror and science fiction movie marathons where those who attend have a love of the genre yet know not to take zombie movies too seriously this film is a tribute to the original not an insult it is intended to be funny and many others who i have heard chant for and applaud it agree with me that it succeeds especially for those of us who have seen notld times watch for the director cameo as news reporter jeff drexel and also if you have the opportunity catch his alien parody loaf
there are some comments about this film that say that it is a bad and silly one and such an excellent actor as pierre fresnay should not have accepted to act in it i think just the opposite that even when the film is strange and has some weaknesses the performance of pierre fresnay is so formidable that it converts the film in something excellent his performance is probably the best in history the film itself has a very polemic scene about the consecration of wine in the cabaret for somebody who does not believe that a priest even a defrocked one can convert it in christ s blood the scene is perhaps bizarre but for somebody who has been raised in a catholic framework it is very emotive even if quite unpleasant the scene of the death of the younger priest is tremendously shocking but it is very well acted pierre fresnay turns the crazy act of murder in something understandable within the temporal madness of his character the tortured defrocked morand who in this terrible way comes back to his duty
clara bow s beauty and wonderful appeal are the chief reason to watch this film hula is not quite up to par with clara s best films but it is still enjoyable she dances she rides her horse and pursues the man that she loves this film is just over an hour in length and was directed by future oscar winner victor fleming gone with the wind the film moves quickly and clara bow has lots of screen time if you like clara i would reccomend hula
i think this show is definitely the greatest show jessica alba does such a great job in it michael weatherly also does an awesome job as well as the rest of the cast the show is very intriguing and they have wonderful storylines and their stunts are amazing it s like watching a hour movie it s definitely worth watching
wracked with guilt after a lot of things felt apart on that ledge an ace mountain rescue climber gabriel walker stallone comes back for his girlfriend jessie janine turner while over the cloudy skies where the weather looks a bit threatening a spectacularly precarious mid air hijacking goes wrong and million taken from a treasury department plane get lost in the middle of nowhere followed by a crash landing stranded off the snowy peaks and needing mountain guides to win back the stolen cash the high trained hikers make an emergency call asking the help of a rescue unit unfortunately gab and hall michael rooker have to team up to arrive at the scene of the crash unaware that the distress call was a fake and a bunch of merciless terrorists led by a psychotic john lithgow are waiting for them only to find out a way off the stormy mountain with the dumped cases of money with breathtaking shots vertiginous scenery dizzying heights perilous climbs freezing temperatures cliffhanger is definitely stallone s best action adventure movie
anyone who lived through the ages of revenge of the nerds and girlpower will appreciate this film it is one of those films that delivers everything you want in a spring break movie plus it makes fun of the college film genre it s funny it s got a cast to die for amy pohler rachel dratch sophie monk parker posey jane lynch amber tamblyn missi pyle and its guaranteed to make you laugh out loud writer actor rachel dratch is a comic genius and sophie monk is such a great villain wilson phillips omg i m just repeating myself now it will live on with girls who like miranda july but feel like eating ice cream and pretending they re dumb
this is an excellent film with an extraordinary cast and acting i was very disappointed with the academy awards when this didn t get the oscar for best film and for best actress woopi goldberg it certainly deserved it in any case take a look at it i am sure you will enjoy it very much
as is well known among long haired youngsters who are incredibly interested in this herr graf s silent rants during summertime aristocrats like to travel to exclusive and distinguished places in order to avoid the heat as well hordes of coarse people taking their ease such bizarre travels around the world also happen in three ages a charming and elegant piece of silent work directed by old hands namely herr buster keaton and herr eddie cline obviously this german count liked most the first segment focused on the stone age due to the affinity that this aristocrat feels about that ancient time preferring that to the second segment which takes place during the glory of rome it should have included the cause of the fall of the roman empire that is to say barbarians or the same thing germans of course the third segment takes place during modern times but this teutonic aristocrat thinks that even years ago should qualify as modern the leitmotiv that moves herr keaton and his companions to travel and endure the strange and hilarious happenings during three different ages is the search for love a very complicated subject to understand for aristocrats who prefer the search for money and self interest every time that three ages is shown in the schloss theatre it is always a pleasure to watch a funny witty silent film even for a serious german count an oeuvre full of gags and gadgets puns pratfalls and acrobatics visual and astounding technical tricks an absolute silent delicatessen that is perfect to allow one to endure the various and coarse summertime severities and now if you ll allow me i must temporarily take my leave because this german count must flirt with an old teutonic heiress who doesn t look her age herr graf ferdinand von galitzien http ferdinandvongalitzien blogspot com
i knew about but had never seen grey gardens before i saw the broadway musical of the same name friends cautioned me that if i had not seen the movie the musical would not make sense it did but it also prompted me to rent the movie at first i thought it was a train wreck full of strange shrieking characters and it was exceedingly hard to watch but being able to stop it digest it and go back to it made me realize why grey gardens is considered to be a memorable documentary both big edie and little edie are unforgettable and their utter lack of self consciousness is worth witnessing both of them remain beautiful despite their encroaching age they have a relationship that will chill any woman and undoubtedly some men and make you re examine your own dealings with your mother in an era when reality television and cinema is commonplace it s fascinating to see the mayleses work from three decades ago and realize what an impact the film must have had i echo what other posters have said how were they allowed to slip into such squalor by their family but beyond that how could two people living in the s be able to escape reality in such a complete fashion or were they simply considered too crazy to be helped i would highly recommend watching this with the commentary track which gave me additional insight into the film
after too many years of waiting anne rivers siddons noted book the house next door has finally been filmed the result veers a bit from the novel which especially in the first story of the trilogy is understandable if unsatisfying as it s a tv film the whole of which is absorbing and actually very good just not as great as the book one of stephen king s favorites and one of mine as well with more running time and fewer constraints as a theatrical release all the richness inherent in the original three part story of the ominous ultramodern house could have been explored and nurtured especially the climactic revelation near the very end still the whole cast does well in this thoughtful tale of mindless malevolence there are a few unnecessary cheap shocks but the growing atmosphere of dread is well developed actually one of the most disturbing scenes involves an abstract painting of the house by its next door amateur artist neighbor who is trying to visualize its corruption on canvas be sure to read the great novel
from the first scene i was really excited i can tell this is going to be awesome i thought the acting was so good i felt as though i was eaves dropping on these peoples lives the music too was exquisitely unsettling the plot started with a sudden event and then drifted forward one could sense toward some irrevocable fate the build was slow but i personally love that kind of thing as long as the quiet tension stays on track and doesn t get derailed before it s ready to pay off so everything s going fine and then the fireworks begin and before you know it the credits are rolling what was all i and my movie night companion could say if you understand the director s intentions the blunt ending does make sense for those of you who have seen the movie already check out the very fascinating and hilarious interview with larry fessenden at filmcritic com but i can t help saying it was not pulled off quite right this probably could have been resolved with as little as ten more minutes of material before the climax in any case it s too bad those ten minutes could have made all the difference in the world but for those of you who don t write or make films you should know that crafting a story arc with the proper timing is a huge pain in the butt and i am certainly not making this critique from any kind of pedestal wendigo feels to me like a masterpiece that was given up on before it was finished but hay i d take a blunted masterpiece any day over an over produced piece of dog poo over compensated with too many digital effects like most horror movies these days one other comment some of the monster scenes left me confused as to whether i should be scared or laughing i don t know how to explain it but there was a distinctively monty python feel about this monster in his more blatent monster forms although this may sound like a terrible criticism for a horror movie i don t know it still worked for me in some crooked way i will never look at deer antlers in the same way again
in conception a splendid film investigating the tensions that occur in family life in the idyllic setting of galiano island off the coast of british columbia the lotus eaters is marred by the fact that it has been packaged as a made for tv movie diminishing itself throughout by the addition of chirpy music over potentially powerful scenes as if to get ready for the interruption of commercials a pity really
warning minor spoilers i ran into this one partway through and watched from there not knowing what it was or what the plot was it certainly held my attention i didn t know until the ending that it was based on a true story the guy she used to do the dirty deed came out looking like a seriously nice guy who just got his head twisted around by a devious girl i have to question how true to life that portrayal is anyone who would murder a husband and wife as they slept just can t be entirely nice still i did have some sympathy for him as he had been set up and taken advantage of that much was made clear my main complaint is with the ending here comes the biggest spoiler skip this paragraph if you don t want to learn it a few minutes before it ended there seemed no way for the truth to be discovered the way it got discovered was in a sting operation but my question is how did the police get convinced to go along with it the movie didn t show us that and it seemed a bit too convenient absent the explanation of how they were persuaded to do it i think the way they handled that was done for dramatic purposes as the omission of the explanation lent an aura of suspense to the crucial scene which otherwise wouldn t have been there we would already have known what the scene was about and what was going on with brad in it otherwise this is a pretty good film i give it it made me think now i m interested to find out the facts of the real case one more thing the movie was done in some of the reviews here seem to be treating it as a more recent movie p s meadow sisto is lovely i hadn t seen her before she can act a little too always a plus in her line of work lol
this early anime movie was a rather good film that i caught once on the science fiction channel when anime was actually popular here in america and not the ratings disaster that adult swim claims it is on the cartoon network i quite frankly think it has less to do with it being less popular and more with the fact people would rather now buy dvds are watch the episodes uncut on the internet this film though probably did not have all that many cuts and the voice work was okay for a dubbed movie though i would rather watch the original japanese version americans tend to use some rather annoying voices for children in anything dubbed this film features a young boy who boards a train called the galaxy express in the hopes that he can make it to a planet that has the technology to turn him into a robot he wishes to become a robot to avenge his mother who was brutally murdered at the hands of a robot who hunts humans for fun during the course of his adventures he becomes friends with the various workers aboard the train as well as a woman that resembles his deceased mother a beautiful woman named matel who as with most woman in anime movies has a secret that could either be really good for our young hero or really bad he goes from planet to planet too as the train makes various stops and he runs into a space pirate named captain harlock who apparently starred in his own animated cartoon series so basically the galaxy express takes place in that universe all in all a very good ride with a rather strange and unexpected ending there would be a sequel to this one but it was not quite as good as this one however the ending was a bit more final than it was here
i wasn t a fan of seeing this movie at all but when my gf called me and said she had a free advanced screening pass i tagged along only for the sake of seeing eva longoria and laughing at jason biggs antics overall it was actually better then i expected but not by much this was like a hybrid of how to lose a guy in days and just like heaven a typical romantic comedy with its moments i guess the movie was quite short though around min but it was enough to tell the whole story build some character development and have a decent happy ending the whole idea of a ghost haunting its former husband was a interesting plot to follow eva did a good job of keeping up the sarcasm and paul rudd and the rest of the supporting cast especially jason biggs kept the laughs coming at a smooth pace overall i liked the movie only because it had a good amount of laughs to keep me going otherwise i would have given this movie a lower rating hey its a chick flick and i m reviewing this movie from a guy s persepctive alright it would be more of a fair fight if females reviewied this movie and gave there thoughts about it

i was surprised at just how much i enjoyed this most thoughtfully delivered drama which owing to its rather unimpressive rating i nearly missed as i rarely give the time of day to any movie rated below having said that i m so glad i gave stone angel the viewing it so very much deserved and so should you if you are one of the increasingly rare sensitive soulful and thoughtful sorts of person left on this earth in living form i must say that in many ways though not all viz its themes execution style production etc stone angel very much reminded me of the much praised the notebook i am so surprised that other commentators didn t pick up on the many similarities which repeatedly struck me throughout this movie so i can only assume that those who ve written comments have yet to see the notebook they may not share any alzheimer s theme yet i can confidently say that if you very much enjoyed the notebook you will certainly find much to engage your time most fruitfully with the stone angel but even if you ve not seen the notebook nor read the book on which this move is based which incidentally i haven t either you should definitely find much to hold your attention firmly as long as your favourite genres don t include fast paced action thrillers this is a movie for thinkers and those who like to reminisce about time s passing how life changes as the years pass and what might have happened in one s life as one gazes back through the years this bizarrely underrated yet great movie really deserves a rating of approximately i can only blame its current lowish rating of on the of idiots who gave it after all it has attracted less than votes at the time of my writing this comment nonetheless if those who gave it the lowest ranking possible were really expecting car chases and explosions why didn t they look for even a few seconds at the movie s premise and promotional lines oh dear whatever the world is coming to don t miss this most underrated gem of a movie but only if you have a brain i e your top ten doesn t include transformers fight club nor the terminator
in the beginning of this film one of the commentators says that he was told that he has two strikes against him he is black and male but in addition to that he has a third strike he s gay you re going to have to be stronger than you ever imagined he is told paris is burning is a documentary about gay black and hispanic men who are tranvestites or transsexuals the miracle of paris is burning is that director jennie livingston takes a subject that could have very easily become a freak show and allows the people in it their humanity we learn their views of homosexuality men women their hopes their disappointments their dreams some of these dreams are so unattainable it s tragic many of the people are seriously in denial this is not a film for everyone there are shots in this movie of nude transsexuals if you have a problem with homosexuality then this movie isn t for you but if you do see this movie you ll realise paris is burning isn t really about men wearing women s clothes it s about a group of people who are routinely marginalised and put down by society at large and what they do to get a sense of community in their lives i ve watched this movie four times since it was released in because it says so many things it s a commentary about materialism in our culture about gender roles about rich and poor people about the media and what it celebrates about fame and adulation paris is burning is one of the most humane and one of the saddest movies i ve ever seen
this movie was my first touch with mr sica so i really didn t know what to expect but what i saw just broke all my expectations in a good way the storyline is not complex and shows us a life of found boy orphan and particularly his connection into the community of poor people who together built themselves a hood of simple metal plate houses this little city in another city lives own life and things are going fine but one day there is a water resource found and a rich nobles man is getting interested in the buying the place but as the title of the movie hints there is a miracle taking place our character gets a wonder dove from his dead mother what is he going to do to protect his friends and all built city as well it was just a masterpiece of natural comedy there is shown the behavior of poor people and how money and property can talk and play with people also many funny moments and scenes are included at the beginning with the spot where sun is shining and many more so according to the fact that i m not a comedy lover you should see this movie because i liked it much i
an absurdly hilarious and strikingly human tale of the jealousies and infidelities surrounding a beetle marriage russian animation pioneer wladyslaw starewicz s mest kinematograficheskogo operatora the cameraman s revenge or the revenge of a kinematograph cameraman is a delight of early animation brimming with highly effective stop motion puppetry and no shortage of imagination mr and mrs beetle have a completely uneventful marriage and both yearn for more excitement in their lives mr beetle s desires can only be satisfied by the beautiful exotic dancer at the gay dragonfly night club whom he visits whenever he takes a business trip to the city she is the only one who understands him a fellow admirer of this dancer an aggressive grasshopper is jealous that mr beetle has stolen his lady and as fate would have it he is also a movie cameraman the devious grasshopper follows mr beetle and his acquaintance to a hotel room where he films their exploits through the keyhole meanwhile mrs beetle has likewise acquired a friend to add excitement to her life he is an artist and he brings her a painting for a present before they both settle down on the couch for some intimacy at that moment however mr beetle returns home and witnesses the entire spectacle as mr beetle bashes through the front door the artist friend clambers up the chimney but he doesn t escape without mr beetle first venting his anger and frustration upon him there is a certain irony in the statement that follows mr beetle is generous he forgives his wife and takes her to a movie he is generous enough to forgive her and yet he had been equally unfaithful just minutes earlier at this point in time however we still haven t forgotten the jealous movie cameraman who had been plotting his revenge and it is no surprise when he turns out to be the projectionist for the film mr and mrs beetle are attending suddenly intercut into the film they are enjoying is the footage of mr beetle s disloyalty and the angry wife hits him across the head with an umbrella before the frightened and angry husband dives through the theatre screen in search of the grasshopper in the final scene both mr and mrs beetle now somewhat more appreciative of each other are serving time in prison for the fire that broke out when mr beetle sought his final revenge we do indeed hope that the home life of the beetles will be less exciting in the future this film may appear to be a mere story of the comings and goings of a miniscule insect species but starewicz is communicating so much more than that this isn t a story about beetles it is a story about us and it s startlingly accurate isn t it
dressed to kill is brian depalma s best film an absolute thrill ride of suspense humor and style that remains unrivaled today depalma has a bum rap in hollywood as most people claim that he rips off alfred hitchcock he does not hitchcock could only dream of what depalma shows in his thrillers sadly the original uncut version of dressed to kill is no longer available on video the current copy released by goodtimes is the jack valenti approved r rated cut but some copies of depalma s original cut still exist it is the one distributed by warner home video in both a green cardboard box with angie dickinson on the cover or in a black clamshell case with the theatrical poster on silver lining these are the ones to get if you can find a copy i have the green one and it is among my treasured possessions anyway back to the story dickinson plays kate miller a sexually frustrated wife who is being treated by dr robert elliott michael caine for her obsessive fantasies while on a trip to the museum a real tour de force for depalma in terms of camera work and suspense miller is picked up by a stranger you can pretty much guess what happens to her since the ads and box art give away the story but there are a few complications a hooker nancy allen is the sole witness to the murder kate miller s son peter keith gordon is a teenage genius determined to solve the crime and dr elliott s answering machine has a certain message on it about a missing razor i m not spoiling the film at all for you since what i have described above takes place within the opening half hour and depalma s biggest surprises are reserved for the last hour this film is explicit however enough for valenti head of the mpaa to demand cuts in the film what surprises me is what cuts he wanted several cuts in the opening shower scene and one or two slashing scenes and some of nancy allen s dialogue valenti wanted cock changed to bulge this is a film that is very violent and bloody yet the objections are to sexual content i d love to hear valenti s explaination at how seeing two women in a tender love scene in lost and delirious is somehow more damaging to a young mind than arnold schwarzenegger blowing away people with a chain gun it just isn t fair what makes dressed to kill so good is that not only are the technical credits first rate but the performances are very good as well michael caine who was in a lot of crap in this time period gives one of his best performances as the doctor angie dickinson is better than usual possibly because she actually has a strong role here nancy allen adds this to her range of performances that has her pegged as one of the most underrated and overlooked actresses in the world keith gordon is wonderful as the genius and i loved all those inventions of his depalma is one of our best directors who has never received the recognition he deserved the recent joke of the afi best thrillers list showed that very few people actually know what a thriller is if they were to actually open their eyes for once they would see that depalma has staked his career in thrillers and is actually the best craftsman this is even better than psycho it s a shame that very few actually know that out of stars
the narrative affirms the classic image of good versus evil in the form of a struggle of brother against brother the main character lin macadam played by james stewart represents justice and righteousness his brother who operates under the persona of dutch henry brown played by stephen mcnally stands for the classic stage coach robbing western outlaw chased by his brother for having killed their father the world the story takes place is the classic dystopian west where the only way to prevent its inhabitants from killing each other is to take away their sidearms as soon as they enter town and the man responsible for keeping this law and order is the classic western lawman wyat earp present as well are such flat characters typical of the western such as the murderous indian warrior the besieged cavalryman and the bonnet clad damsel in distress another important archetype in this film that which gives the film it s name is a custom made winchester rifle the weapon can be viewed as an allegory for the rewards given to those who do things honorably once it is stolen from its rightful owner it brings tragedy to everyone that comes in contact with it in this sense it resembles other such icons like the holy grail in raiders of the lost ark and the blood stained letter in saving private ryan this gives the film an element of surrealism which is usually absent from westerns a genre not known for esoteric themes and symbols being essentially a revenge film it shares this element with many other examples of the genre such as jack arnold s no name on the bullet and clint eastwood s unforgiven there is also a tacit theme of rape in winchester waco johnny dean one of the film s villains played very effectively by dan duryea abducts a woman after killing her husband the volatile cowboy toys with the tenderfoot husband and dispatches him like a caricature of a cat toying with an insect before biting its head off waco johnny dean eventually gets what is coming to him after coming in contact with the ominous winchester rifle the main story of winchester is reminiscent of the mythological tale of jason and his quest for the golden fleece as told in apollonius argonautica both stories deal with the acquisition of a sacred object that possesses some sort of intangible quality like jason stewart s character hops from one adventure to the next in search of a one of a kind prize another theme in winchester that is similar to a mythic tale is the struggle between brothers several stories of antiquity deal with this issue such as the hebrew bible s tale of cain and abel and the vulgate tale of romulus and remus as for the theme of abduction and rape present in anthony mann s film it is present in many mythological works such as the rape of europa as told by ovid in his metamorphoses winchester is a fine example of the western genre and acts as the objective correlative for many classic american western and ancient mythological themes
years ago i did follow a soap on tv so i was curious about this movie and i was so rewarded for finding it it s a marvelous spoof of soaps with jealousies the usual actors insecurities and all sorts of lovely excesses but more than anything an amazing cast and an incredible script how did someone get all those top notch actors to play in such a silly sort of movie and how did this little movie get writers to write the perfect lines i never hear anyone talk about this movie or even admit hearing of it but it s marvelous and i highly recommend seeing it sometimes i ll throw it on while doing housecleaning and end up sitting on the couch watching laughing and thoroughly enjoying the whole wonderful thing many congrats to all who made it
fairly funny jim carrey vehicle that has him as a news reporter who temporarily gets the power of god and wrecks havoc carrey is back in familiar ground here and looks to be having a good time and jennifer aniston as his put upon girlfriend is also charming and affecting the story is predictible to the extreme but the cast including morgan freeman as god is great and makes the film worth catching grade b

my wife did not realize what a gem this movie was when she picked it up it is a story that shows real world success through hard work and determination that is so refreshing in a world of violent movies not that i dis like them but you have to love a movie that succeeds without it
nice movie with a great soundtrack which spans through the rock landscape of the s and s radiofreccia describes a generation it describes life in a small village near correggio hometown of ligabue the singer who wrote the book that inspired the movie it describes life of young people and their problems relating to the world it reminds of trainspotting with a bit of italian touch
of all arnold s mid s movies who would have thought that most relevant today would be the running man a chilling and surprisingly realistic tale of reality tv gone mad it may have been far fetched back then but not so now not when you think about it currently reality tv shows are either scraping the bottom of the barrel or desperate to raise the bar if the next one isn t more controversial as the last it s a dud how long will it be before we really do see shows like the running man how long before we have court appointed theatrical attorneys or the entertainment division of the justice department there is so much satire and intelligence in this movie that may have been missed back in that is desperate to be seen again considering the current state of tv shows the biggest message of all is you are being lied to it s no secret that the government and the media work in cahoots and the masses believe what the media tells them to believe it s a very scary state of affairs and unless more accurate representations of the truth emerge we may easily accept a brutal show like the running man in the near future it s no secret that reality tv is not very realistic it s edited and reshaped before being aired and it s only what the networks want you to see usually it s far from the real truth although rather different than stephen king s book the ending is completely changed the script does conform to the typical arnie formula yes he does have numerous and very corny one liners and he does say i ll be back which he never really said that often anyway when you think about it in the most ironic situation yet but he s still a zillion times better in the role then christopher reeve or dolph lundgren would have been these two were considered before arnie believe it or not the director is none other than dave starsky himself paul michael glaser it may not be artistic but it is still strong enough to generate excitement and his use of neon and flourescent colors gives each individual set a pretty cool look andrew davis not a director i particularly like was attached before glaser though no matter who directs the film is still marred by a very heavy s feel first of all harold faltermeyer s score remember him is incredibly dated and robs the action scenes of any timeless integrity and the fashion sense of the movie is far too excessive to be convincingly set in the future apart from the dated feel the only other thing that bugs me is the poorly staged shoot out that passes as the climax this new dvd is a zillion times better than the original release gone is the horrid letterbox picture in its place is a brand new hi definition anamorphic transfer the colors sparkle and literally pop from the screen the new dolby ex and dts es soundtrack are also amazing there constant use of the surround channels to great effect and the bass is strong and powerful definitely one of the best re masters i ve seen so far two intriguing documentaries a trailer and a meet the stalkers gimmick are included in this disc set that comes in a rather neat slip case
if there is a movie to be called perfect then this is it so bad it wasn t intended to be that way but superb anyway go find it somewhere whatever you do do not miss it
g mez pereira is the responsible for some of the most despicable comedies of latest spanish cinema just take a look at his curriculum vitae so i didn t expect that much of cosas que hacen in fact i don t know why in the world did i decide to watch it anyway i just did and what a surprise it looks that g mez pereira has finally matured and now he s capable of making a good movie he s last work deals with the midlife crisis the disappointing and the seeking for a second chance after you ve ruined it all the last half hour of the movie the more dramatic is the best part and it just makes worth watching the film also we have eduard fernandez playing the main role and i keep on thinking he s the best actor of his generation by far my rate
i do try not to take imdb ratings to heart but i was flabbergasted when i saw the rating to one of my childhood favourites it doesn t wow me as much at but as a family film this is a sweet and well meaning movie kids will definitely love it and won t mind the flaws and the adults can guess the actor behind each character and admire the subliminal messaging of the film none of the film was preachy in any way in fact it has a great message that added to its sweetness i will admit though that the story is on the thin side and some scenes like screweyes s death which still freaks me out may be a tad on the scary side but the animation is well above average with nice colours and good character animation the music by james horner is very beautiful and the song featured is memorable catchy and amusing i really liked the characters louie is probably the most in depth of them all but the dinosaurs were at least engaging martin short s clown was both hilarious and emphatic the part when he tells screweyes i quit had me in stitches my favourite is screweyes though an effective villain who is crafty and i suppose intelligent if anything though i wish the film kept in the part when he explains how he lost his eye and why he is scared of crows because that way he could ve been more developed in terms of depth the script while not oscar worthy has its funny and heart warming parts and should keep kids and adults entertained the voice acting for me was what made the movie john goodman martin short rhea perlman felicity kendall and yeardley smith all gave solid performances but special mention has to go to kenneth mars for he was absolutely superb as screweyes and almost unrecognisable all in all this is a good movie i don t get the rating honestly i don t sure this film isn t perfect and it is not as good as a dinosaur movie such as land before time but it is good fun bethany cox
i really think i should make my case and have every horror and or cult movie buff go and see this movie i did it is excellent very atmospheric and unsettling and scary incridible how they could make such a gem of a film with the very low read no budget they had synopsis taken from website one morning an old man wanders out into the woods in search of his runaway cat he finds instead a child without parents and a murder with no corpse on this website imdb there is no trailer but i will leave a link here to the site of the movie itself where there is a trailer which is quite unsettling so please go and check it out www softfordigging com
olivier kosentsev richardson coranado zefferelli and almerayeda have all directed hamlet but branagh s the only one who got it right this is the only film of hamlet that contains the full four hours of william shakespeare s masterpiece and gives a unique feel to the whole story not many directors could pull this off without boring their audience but branagh s skillful use of bravora film style and stunt casting allows people to see the importance of the scenes that are usually cut out examples of this include gerarde depardue as ranyaldo whos entire purpose in the film was to simply say yes my lord as polonius asks him to spy on leartes this also included billy crystal as the grave digger robin williams as osric jack lemmon as marcellous and charlton heston as the actor branagh s performance of the act scene soliloquy which again is usually cut out is nothing short of c cinematic marvel as the camera slowly pulls back as the intensity grows it is a scene that literally made me want to jump out of my chair and start applauding branagh is the only film maker that understood the importance of every scene in this film and knew how to convey that importance to the general audience this is a must see for everyone who enjoy s good story telling brilliant acting and incredible direction all of these part of william shakespeares greatest triumph
i grew up in royersford pa the town where jerry s market was i remember my whole family going out to watch the filming i remember a guy showing the blob to me and my brothers in a bucket i also would like to share that my mother was in the movie her hair style was the same as aneta corsaut s and she was ill one evening and they saw my mom and asked her to sit in the car with steve mcqueen for some shots from behind they payed her and gave her a story to tell until she passed away this past august my mom was not a teenager and she was a few months from giving birth to my little sister
i m going to review the films as a whole because i feel that is how it should be considered and watched when i talk about the film i am talking about parts together when watched one after the other as they should be thank you jon anderson steven soderbergh benicio del toro this film is a refreshing bold gritty and true film and it hearkens a new style of film making no faux drama no swelling sound track not faux documentary style just clean shots and an attempt to stick to the facts i have been reading jon anderson s che guevara a revolutionary life and recently finished fidel s auto biography and this had helped my ability to soak this film in properly but i have to say that it is jon anderson s exhaustive penultimate and wonderful biography that has given this film the proper historical back bone anderson was consultant on this film or these films what makes this film a true thing is that it is clean no swelling music or slow motion photography to heighten drama and even more importantly no fake documentary shaky camera just square shots and straight forward shooting style the type of camera used makes you feel right there in the jungle benicio del toro should be given full honors for this i never doubted him as che throughout the film not once he did a wonderful job and i will respect him for ever for this some people complain that the film only deals with slices of his life and not the whole but i think this is one of the true beautiful aspects of this film it doesn t try to be everything it doesn t try to tell the story a person s life is too multifaceted to try and tell in or hours this is one of the subtle beauties of this film it resists that temptation and stays focused on the intent of letting us get a feel for che his developing militaristic mind and the forces around him it focuses on slices of time the battle to over throw batista che s u n speech and the gorilla preparations in bolivia motorcycle diaries already told his young man side and i applaud s soderbergh for focusing on other aspects instead i keep referring to jon anderson s book and the film stays true the only weak link for me are the casting not the performance of matt damon in a film so loaded with true to life performances an american matt damon playing a bolivian is a clunky stretch he does well but after so much care in the casting this was an over site small and completely forgiven the reality that the rest of the casting gives you and most notably benicio del toro s amazing job put s this film at the top of my list the fact that this film went almost straight to video say s something about how the cold war ethics that would never allow the revolutionized cuba to become what it might have are still at work keeping it s story quiet if not out of clandestine muffling then out of the effects of properly done propaganda that has prejudiced this topic this is a must see film and jon anderson s che guevara a revolutionary life is a must read if you want to start to get a grasp of the early effects on the global mind set regarding the expansion of international political financial chess moves of the s s s that placed unfair pressure on our south american neighbors and the effects it fostered
if you have any kind of heart and compassion for people this is a tough movie to watch at least in the second half of it it s in that segment where we see nice little kid get beaten up and then a retarded mentally challenged man go off the deep end after he witnesses this brutal act against the child it s not pleasant material however it s a good movie and the acting is good too the story will sit with you awhile dominick is the mentally disabled guy and is played by tom hulce i think this might be hulce s best role ever he s looked after by a med student eugene played by ray liotta who became a star the following year with kevin costner s field of dreams dominick is a goodhearted garbage man who reads hulk comic books and loves wrestling he s the type of slow guy that you can t help but love and root for to live a happy life when he freaks out it s for several good reasons and well see the film for the whole story it s worth your time but be prepared to go on real emotional roller coaster and possibly be very upset at some things you see
let me start by saying i have never reviewed a movie on imdb before however i am in the video biz myself and coming from that perceptive i can say without a shadow of a doubt that this film is what a short should be it has a very good story and another thing i love an even better twist ending opening was very well done i loved video chosen for it and how it was edited i am not a fan of b w but the way this film uses the effect it works and with any film that is all that matters the flow of the film works perfectly and editing was very well done from a technical side of things which is side i normally work on everything is also very well done there is no major tech stuff to point out only minor one i have is that the end credits are a little bouncy this is probably due to a rendering issue let me also say that i would have prefer to seen more of the love scene but i am guy so you can chalk that up to a guy factor so overall i rate it a it is worth the watch if you fan of indies and or short films ps sorry for bad grammar or spelling
again it seems totally illogical to me at least that arthur merits a mere out of possible steve gordon s one shot masterpiece herein is the totally unlikely if not quite impossible melding of wildly disparate elements that he managed to make alcoholism laugh friendly rather than tearjerking tragic is in itself wonderful that he gave dudley moore his finest role and every other cinematic element herein its optimal impact including the score seems to me patent and egregious i challenge anyone to sit through this film and not laugh out loud but apparently nearly a third of its audience has so managed well i for one found and find gordon s effort both laughable and lovable and the iikes of geraldine fitzgerald s great aunt and stephen elliott s murderous would be father in law absolute gems of background characters even the black chauffeur managed to escape patronization and the late sniffish sir john gielgud was right about accepting his fee but wrong about undertaking his role arthur makes no effort to underztand much less rationalize the scourge of alcoholism hey ifit ain t booze it s other drugs of choice including meth and addictions are merely symptoms not targets it simply observes in its own quizzical manner
without mental anachronism this film which i would like to find in dvd offer an extraordinary diving in the vital and mental context of thought of the people before the disenchantment of the world that there is thirty years a director and a scenario writer could test one such empathy and such a romantic truth to do it of them masterpiece leaves me astounding it would be necessary to be able to see and re examine it film for better seizing than the temporal and cultural distance us to make lose of capacity to be included understood analyze and finally to accept of such or such example of primitive thought because this thought maintaining almost impossible to feel in the secularized world however contain certain keys of our behavior that only them future generations will be able to analyze with sufficient relevance if somebody knows where i then to get a numerical copy or vhs to me or dvd thank you in advance
and it s not because since her days on clarissa explains it all that i ve had a bit of a crush on melissa joan hart who at the time this show was popular was already well into her s but was still able to get teenage roles sabrina the teenage witch was hart s next big leap after her clarissa days based on the comic strip sabrina spellman is you guessed it a teenage witch who attempts to balance her witchcraft antics with the demands of everyday teenage life she is aided in her endeavors by her two aunts and a wise cracking black cat as she goes from high school to college and finally to her career in journalism as usual hart is the show s heart soul sabrina the teenage witch is quite moving and very funny and it s a shame that it took me so long to realize how great it was i only wish there were some newer episodes that we could all enjoy
back in my high school days in salina kansas they filmed something called the brave young men of weinberg locally and the film crews were rather prominent for weeks eventually we learned that the film was up the academy and was a bit ummm lower brow than we had been led to believe i had to see it since i was there and the local audiences seemed less than pleased at the showing i was and thought it was a rather artless attempt at a post animal house type of comedy right down to the fart jokes watched it many times since and my opinion has mellowed a bit it s dumb but at times it catches a bit of the mad magazine humor at least as well as most mad tv ron liebman might hate it but he is nearly perfect and unforgettable for me my favorite moment would have been a brief scene on santa fe avenue where i had parked my car while i was buying some guitar strings too bad my pinto s brief appearance usually seems to get cut for tv haven t seen the new dvd but if my old pinto is visible they ve got a sale
the first of two jim thompson adaptations released in the other being the more well known grifters after dark has all of thompson s hallmarks dangerous women the confidence game and characters that are either not as dim as others suspect them of being or not as harmless jason patric is superb as a former boxer disqualified from the sport for life due to an incident in the ring director james foley uses raging bull esquire sequences to flesh out the back story and the too little seen rachel ward also delivers a great performance but bruce dern is the film s secret weapon his sweet talking grifter uncle bud subtly commands each of his scenes there s almost no comic relief in this film so watch it prepared to be sucked into the void
anyone who doesn t laugh all through this movie has been embalmed i have watched it at least twenty times and i still get tears in my eyes at many of the scenes sally field is absolutely perfect as celest talbert a fading soap star whose supporting cast is trying to get her replaced in hopes that their own star will rise fields at still has that wonderful and beautiful pixie quality and a perfect figure that belies her having had three children i m biased i m in love with her the cast of soapdish is filled with stars who perform their roles to perfection kevin kline is flawless as are robert downey jr an ing nue elizabeth shue whoopi goldberg teri hatcher in one of her early roles carrie fisher as the oversexed casting director who auditions an actor for a small part as a waiter without his shirt on kathy najimy is wonderful as the hapless costume designer and best of all cathy moriarty as nurse nan who leads the plot to get fields character removed from the show is hilarious this movie should have won oscars for best comedy best leading lady in a comedy best leading man in a comedy and myriad other bests including writing directing and supporting actors and actresses get the dvd so you can watch it over and over for the next twenty five years you will still be laughing at it when the disc wears out
this is one of those movies that make better trailers than full length feature films the concept was really cool and different the humor was unique i just felt there were missed opportunities to put the punch into this movie so many lines and gags were left hanging too long with no definite ending and really didn t leave me laughing wilson wilson farris thurman were great wanda sykes was under used in this film and needed more exposure and more opportunities to spin her character into more screen time out of for me more of a dvd rental also i was looking for some sort of a feel good music video during the end credits something that has become sort of a trade mark to these romantic comedy films a la something about mary meet the parents but again i was left feeling a little cheated by fact that this could have been a much better film with a little more music and punchier punch lines it felt like it was rushed into theaters
this film is quite simply brilliant the cinematography is good the acting superb and the story absolutely breathtaking this is the story of donald woods a white south african who thought himself a liberal until he found out the reality of apartheid kevin kline is completely convincing so much so that when donald woods himself appeared on tv some years later i recognised him from kline s portrayal denzel washington also turns in a masterful performance as ever i urge you to watch this it is long but it is worth your patience because it tells such an incredible story remember folks this really happened
very good drama about a young girl who attempts to unravel a series of horrible crimes she enlists the aid of a police cadet and they begin running down a series of clues which lead to a traveling carny worker with a long police record an ending which is guaranteed to keep you on the edge of your seat
george lopez never caught my interest in his stand up comedy and he still doesn t but this show is a work of art it s not ever show where the jokes keep you laughing every time you remember it and jokes that re memorable at that this show just has an upbeat look to it and the characters range from an old short drunk to an dyslexic teenager i don t know who writes this show but that person does a great job if they had just continued the show i m sure that it would get a positive response from the critics of this great country if you are looking for a good traditional comedy then george lopez is the show for you the one bad thing is the title george lopez really imagine the fresh prince of bel air being will smith c mon man but otherwise this show is genius
at your video store you might find this gem the human condition in modern times la no exaggerated drama just a collapsing of events that might happen to any group of individuals over time helps you understand the joys and desperation of urban life the direction and cutting are top class cinematography and music very much follows the mood and situation and the cast excellent casting and excellent acting no one out of place or out of character and it s not really as much a downer as you would expect i gave it of if you havent seen it do
death lends a hand is one of the pivotal early episodes of columbo that helped define the show for the next thirty years it marks the first of robert culp s four appearances three as a murderer playing much the same role in each show in this case culp plays brimmer the head of a large private detective company who is asked to investigate whether the wife of a wealthy newspaper magnate mr kennicut is having an affair although she is brimmer decides not to tell kennicut in the hope that he can blackmail his wife in return for snippets of information about her husband s business associates she reacts badly to this suggestion an argument ensues which rapidly turns violent as brimmer whacks her across the face because he is wearing a large ring the blow knocks her to the ground and kills her there are some really priceless moments in this episode one of my favourite scenes is where columbo pretends to be into palm reading although this is in fact a ruse to discover the shape and size of brimmer s ring without admitting that he knows the killer wore a ring columbo being columbo he only reveals what he really knows when the time is exactly right to turn the screws a little so initially he goofily plays the part of a rather simple minded man who gets excited by the lifeline going over the mound of the moon or some equally ridiculous palm reading mumbo jumbo another great scene is when brimmer tries to offer columbo a job for his firm effectively bribing him to stop poking his nose around again columbo doesn t reveal that he knows what s going on he pretends to be honoured and excited by this job offer and there s another where columbo says to kennicut in front of brimmer that he wishes the murderer could hear their conversation he wants to hint to brimmer that he is onto him without directly accusing him so he rather cruelly but understandable in the circumstances decides to play mindgames on brimmer in order to spook him into panicking and doing something stupid which of course he does all the while the grieving kennicut is unaware of the subtext of this conversation it s only near the end that columbo explains all to kennicut not shown on screen i won t reveal how columbo finally nails the killer bang to rights but let s just say there s a potato involved a really really good episode possibly the very best of the first series if you liked this then you ll like double exposure too also featuring robert culp
this is a totally delightful and unexpected film you start by following a young person who hopes to get into the qualifying football game between bahrain and iran if iran win they will get into the world cup in germany the problem is the young person is a girl and girls or women for that matter are not allowed into football matches to sit with men what follows is a wonderful comedy played with consummate skill by a small ensemble cast the film explores the absurdity of restrictions on the freedom of women and for that matter the young soldiers who have to corral them there are some excellent set pieces not least when one of the girls must go to the toilet and of course the stadium has no toilets for women the camera work is of the simplest and in some ways this story could have been told as a stage play yet it is the small scale that gives the film its bite great cinema no probably not great entertainment for sure
this amazing oscar winner in total and john ford s first academy award winner is simply spellbinding with a pounding score by max steiner called an art film because ford had very little money to make this great story about guilt and retribution and greed and stupidity but what makes this movie such a classic is the direction and astounding photography and use of fog and lighting that was so different from the usual american film and more in the tradition of german expressionism and the oscar winning performance by victor mclaglen as the drunken gypo is simply unbelievable basically the movie takes place in ireland and gypo turns in a friend in the rebel movement to the english to collect pounds to give to his girlfriend but having all that money he starts blowing it on an all night drunk and giving it away while the leaders of the movement are trying to track down the informer the whole movie is one night in a dark and foggy ireland and a cast of characters that are memorable but all along the whole world of gypo is closing in on him both psychologically if i had to pick maybe three directors to have all their movies on a deserted island forever and nobody elses john ford would certainly be one of them what a truly remarkable movie
good funny straightforward story excellent nicole kidman i almost always like the movies she s in this was a good vehicle for someone adept at comedy and drama since there are elements of both a romantic comedy wrapped around two crime stories great closing lines chaplin very good here was also good in another good but unpopular romantic comedy truth about cats dogs maybe they re too implausible ebert didn t even post a review for this the great screwball comedies obviously were totally implausible bringing up baby etc if you ve seen one implausible comedy you ve seen them all or maybe people are ready to move on from the s weird birthday girl is a movie i ve enjoyed several times nicole kidman may be the killer app for home video
with twelve monkeys you need to pay attention but if you do that you probably find a lot to appreciate i know i did the story is interesting and deals with time traveling a virus killed a lot of people back in and a guy named cole bruce willis is send back to and to find a cure for the virus in he is arrested and put in a mental hospital there he meets jeffrey goines brad pitt who probably has something to do with the virus he also meets psychiatrist dr kathryn railly madeleine stowe who doesn t believe him in when cole disappears from the mental hospital while he is chained and locked in a room and re appears in kathryn starts believing cole s stories the movie constantly plays with time cole makes a phone call and leaves a message in it is picked up in the future and they send someone for cole that someone appears only seconds after the phone call things like this happen throughout the movie and therefore you must keep attention you could ask some questions but since you can t have an answer yourself it is better to agree with the movie twelve monkeys works as sci fi with some great images and a dark atmosphere and it works as a thriller you are never certain of what will happen next and that helps the movie may be it has some flaws in the story but since it is about a fictional thing like time traveling you should accept what the movie tells us and just try to enjoy that was the easy part for me
ladislas starewicz s curiosity with insects and cinema melds into a short film about a love triangle between mr beetle an artistic grasshopper and mrs beetle the rather simple story of an adulterous beetle couple that both seek stimulation outside their marriage is similar to a biograph or vitagraph short of the time starewicz s twist on the story is to use embalmed beetles with wires straightening the legs in frame by frame animation the story builds as mr beetle is unknowingly caught on camera with a dragonfly from the local nightclub by a jealous grasshopper when mr beetle comes home to find his wife in the arms of her artistic friend he chases her around angrily but eventually forgives her and takes her out to see a movie however mrs beetle soon learns of her husband s infidelities as the movie they watch is the jealous grasshopper s footage of mr beetle and the dragonfly together mrs beetle thrashes mr beetle with her umbrella mr beetle jumps through the screen and they both end up in jail after the projector they wreck catches on fire the insects are placed in humanized settings such as a house or a nightclub and are given human characteristics of jealousy anger lust and revenge the insect characters carry briefcases drive motorcars and even wear shoes yet they also twitch their antennae and open and close their mandibles as real insects would the novelty of the story doesn t wear itself out even after multiple viewings but as fluid as the movements are the film moves slowly action happens with intricate detail but rapidity and a quicker pace of filming is lost in the process despite its pace the film is an excellent example of starewicz s early puppetry and is highly recommended
bellocchio refers to this as a mainly political movie a description of the revolutionary movement in italy but that seems more metaphor than reality well almost everything in the movie seems like metaphor the revolutionaries of whom we see and about whom we learn very little might as well be mafiosi out with the old and in with the new andrea s papa a psychoanalyst seems to stand for the usual traditional bourgeois values morally upright unperturbed clean and tidy thoroughly ritualized giullia the girlfriend of a revolutionary seems to represent what can happen to someone who needs very badly a cause to support but is unable to muster up the kind of devotion such a commitment demands i m guessing here andrea the adolescent boy seems to be the only guy in the movie who is not in some unquiet way upatz he s respectful of his father but disobedient too he loves giullia or so we assume although he s not really old enough to have learned how to manage his reflexes optimally but he leaves her in order to show up at school and complete his final exams his course between these contradictory lifestyles could be described as media he s the man in between who knows the meaning of gradualism who can keep his cool while those about him are screaming most of this is summed up during the oral part of his finals when he is asked to translate and comment on an excerpt from antigone which contrasts the traditional authority of the gods with the notion of secularity and free will that brings us by no particular course that i m aware of to marushka detmars she brings to mind a new yorker cartoon of a few years ago two hippos are neck deep in the river staring at a gazelle drinking from the bank and one hippo says to the other i hate her she s a good actress let me get that out of the way but so is everyone else in the film she carries with her in her speech and manner the rich glitter of outright lunacy and it all comes from the actress too not from directorial aid detmars isn t nuts the way catherine deneuve was nuts in repulsion the walls don t turn to rubber and grow hands instead we see her animated sometimes too animated and she gives us shocking jolts when her mood abruptly changes and becomes threatening the way a looming thunderstorm is threatening a critic described her as sultry but that s probably not the word he was searching for she s compellingly beautiful with her fluffy brown hair her wide white ready grin her impulsive giggles and her eyes are like the eyes in the paintings on the walls of ancient egyptian tombs the sexy parts are pretty erotic not so much because one of them is explicit but because we ve gotten to know the characters involved it s more interesting to spy on the honeymoon couple next door than go to a skin flick actually there isn t that much sex there is only one scene of simulated intercourse but the director lets it play out in what seems to be real time at least real time for an eighteen year old boy the young man who plays andrea is fine too which is a necessary thing because the film depends almost entirely on him and giullia they have to carry it and they do if it were not for their performances i m not sure this would be as interesting or as admirable flick as it is it could easily have been turned into a rather slow boring romance worth it
has there ever been a movie more charming than this one of the reasons everything works so well is that the group of actors really seem to interact and have an effect on each other s lives the center of it is the romance of james stewart and margaret sullavan who work together and can t get along face to face but who completely connect with each other anonymously as pen pals but there are also supporting characters and unlike a lot of romantic comedies including you ve got mail the recent update of shop they re not just whipped up to support the two leads and their needs everyone gets to be an intricate part of ernst lubitsch s rich tapestry of charm one of the most heartwarming scenes in movie history takes place when the near tragic frank morgan casually and humbly searches for someone to have christmas dinner with a must see out of
i generally love these mystery police charlie chan type of movies and this is no exception however something seems bad with this movie a late attempt to switch from cerebral moto movies centered around the plot contrivances to a salad bar spoilt by comedy relief that is as relieving as sore feet a typecast buffoon appears from nowhere impersonating a clumsy englishman who plays the detective and even other characters seem entangled into providing comedy relief the plot may seem odd or a bare excuse to us today but back then the possibility of epochal archaeological discoveries was not only real but a commonplace occurrence
gi samurai sees sonny chiba and some other guys get transported back to civil war stricken feudal japan for no particular reason and much carnage ensues it s a rather over the top essay of sword vs machine gun that ultimately yields some interesting results the plot essentially runs along the rails that you might expect from the title initial fish out the water antics what is this flying metal box etc etc aren t we better off here discussions and ultimately a huge battle the latter is proof that the film doesn t take itself seriously at all the carnage taking up most of the second half as samurai army battles chiba s platoon a face off one would fully expect from the title but it still manages to overwhelm with its inventiveness and extravagance it s certainly one of the most unique battle sequences of its time and doesn t drag despite its extended length chiba gives a gruff performance as iba initially a good leader but someone who finally finds himself questioning his own morals as the situation slowly has an effect on him this is certainly one of his better vehicles from his terrific cv by the final act the two worlds have had such an effect on each other you have to wonder if it was a bit of nihilism on the part of the writers as they seem to be asking weren t we better off back then but this is maybe reading a bit much into was can generally be described as a hugely entertaining two hours of almost non stop action
homeward bound the incredible journey is one of those wonderful old movies about house pets deserves a place among the great movies of its genre and even the cinema world in general together with other animal movies like old yeller napoleon fluke and air bud this means it is more than just a movie about pets can this possibly be just a remake it is too good to be a remake i know this one by heart since my early teen years when i was it s a family movie to treasure it s emotional thrilling adventurous exciting entertaining humorous charming sweet nostalgic beautiful heartwarming and sometimes dramatic it s one of those movies to put a smile on the faces of those who appreciate this kind of films this movie does not lack qualities it has a well thought story enjoyable characters excellent and relaxing instrumental soundtrack dazzling sceneries landscapes of the magnificent sierra mountains in oregon speaking of the vistas it s not all mountains forests trees rivers waterfalls sunsets in conclusion all of pure nature s wonders truly a full panorama the main human characters are nice well developed and well portrayed by respective actors robert hays is awesome as the kind hearted dad bob seaver kim greist is good as laura burnford veronica lauren is equally good as hope kevin chevalia is conventional as the youngest and cute brother jamie his appearance actually reminds me very much of kevin corcoran in old yeller benj thall is great as peter burnford when it comes to our quadruped pals shadow is my favorite shadow is the loyal wise mature beautiful caring and loving old golden retriever brilliantly voiced by don ameche chance the american bulldog is the opposite of shadow he is carefree silly impatient anxious clumsy hilarious and loves to play voiced by the talented michael j fox chance just can t stand still sassy is the epitome of cats s image elegant independent very confident and self proud with a typical cat attitude but with a certain feline charm sassy is a seal point himalayan cat one of the most beautiful cat breeds sassy is voiced by sally field who also does a good job our four legged friends are themselves great actors by nature ben as shadow rattler as chance and tiki as sassy it s an underrated movie but a classic by its own right its sequel is clearly inferior this should definitely be on top
i would have to say that this is the first quality romantic comedy i have ever seen it had depth and although you knew from the beginning who was going to end up together there was still longing and anticipation the thought that maybe they won t get together it is an indie film after all this movie was well written directed and acted the dancing on the side of the road scene was magnificent
i had lost faith in sooraj r barjatya after the movie main prem ki deewani hoon then a year back now i saw promos for vivah which looked good but i didn t want to waste my hard earned money watching it in cinema when the film first came out on dvd i rented it and watched and i loved the movie and took back my words for sooraj i just finished watching it yesterday again and this time i thought i have to review this movie sooraj r barjatyagot it right this time okay i was not a huge fan of hum app ke hai kaun but i have always loved manie pyar kiya after manie pyar kiya to me i think vivah is barjatyas best work i hardly ever cry in a movie but this movie made me feel like crying if you have ever been in love before then there will be many moments that will touch you in this movie the movie is just too sweet and will have you falling in love with it my view a much underrated movie the story of this movie you might call desi and very old times but to me it seemed modern because the two couples which are getting an arrange marriage are aware it s an old tradition it s done in present times lots of people don t believe in this arrange marriage but i do the journey between the engagement and wedding which will always be special and this movie shows it clearly when prem meets poonam for the first time they show it how it is and that s reality and my parents where saying that s how they got married and it showed it in a way which is so real yes people the way prem and poonam meet in this movie is how most marriages happen it was a very sweet you feel nervous yet excited the song do ajnabe shows that very well getting back to the story yes it s a journey which you soon get glued to between prem and poonam shahid kapoor and amrita rao and there families a twist occurs in this movie which is really good the last mins you all will be reaching for the tissue box what makes this film so amazing is the chemistry between prem and poonam how they fall for each other is too sweet simple boy and simple girl when they first meet during and after the song do anjane ajnabe it s very sweet to watch she hardly says anything and prem does all the talking being honest with her about his past and the girl he liked and him smoking then it leads on to them all having a family trip and then that s when they really do fall for each other it makes you just want to watch the couple and watch all the sweet moments they have another factor is that poonam chichi is really mean to her and you feel sorry for poonam because she has been treated bad and makes you want to see her happy and when she finally finds happiness you too start feeling happy with her the movie basically makes you fall in love with poonam more then just prem when she finds happiness through prem you want her to stay happy and also hope nothing goes wrong because the character is shown as a sweet simple girl which brings me to performances and amrita roa as poonam is amazing in the movie her best work till date you will fall in love with this innocent character and root her on to find happiness shahid kapoor as prem is amazing too he is poonam support in the film he is her happiness the movie together they share an amazing chemistry and i have never seen a cuter couple since srk and kajol if ishq vishk didn t touch you to telling you how cute they are together this surely will mujhe haq hai the song and before that is amazing chemistry they show scenes which touched me was when prem takes poonam to his room and shows her that s where they will be staying and he opens her up and they have a moment between them which is too sweet again if you have ever been in love with someone that much these scenes you can defiantly connect to the film is just the sweetest thing you will see ever the direction is spot on to me a good movie is basically something that can pull me in and stop me believe for this hours what is being seen here is fake and there is a camera filing them to me this film pulled me in and for those three hours i felt really connected to the movie the songs you will only truly like when you have seen the movie as they are songs placed in the situation after i saw the movie i been playing the songs non stop the music is amazing the story is simply amazing too what more can i ask for what i can finally say it rarely do we get a movie that makes us feel good this movie after you have seen it will make you feel really good and make you want to be a better person its basically the sweetest journey ever its basically showing you they journey between engagement and marriage and many people say it s the bestest part of your life well this movie actually shows you way do people actually say that why do people actually say that the journey is just that amazing watch this movie and you will find out why the journey is amazing
for such films like anchors aweigh few have been bestowed with as many academy award accolades in a warm up for happy hour either was a beleaguered year for good film or they were still suffering advance shock by billy wilder s the lost weekend that they wrote anything starting with a on the ballot for best picture to please the still musical picture faithful public since gene kelly was nominated for this performance instead of his role in singin in the rain then there had to be something wrong with the behind the scenes rigging systems at mgm of course the studio is on its best behaviour during this much lauded tour of the great studios and of hollywood itself handy for those stuck on the other side of the world yet a sailor suit musical with the brilliant talents of gene and frank sinatra is certainly an enjoyable farce despite the need for more people to yawn at the previews for the musical so today s audiences wouldn t be slapped with an unnecessary runtime there have been many longer pieces before and since but in this case all of the charming kathryn grayson s scenes could have been eliminated until the viewing of kiss me kate it may have been necessary non opera enthusiasts to watch any of her films with remote control in hand if there was a need to practice picking up women for s on the town then perhaps the shore leave lucky sailors did not have to promise an audition with jose iturbi and strike up the piano for a whole hearted susie rendition few are lucky to get a screen test at the golden studios of mgm then few are even luckier to be attended to there are no regrets to be had about the successful screen tests of susan abbot or kathryn grayson but it makes the continual non opera enthusiast hope for the eventual pink slip to be handed out to both but for all the star talents are good shape and an above average score thrown in with a slight but fun great navy story intertwined with young ambitious navy boys good for late bursts of wartime morale makes anchors at least doesn t question picking the wrong mgm film the direction holds up as the cast carries the story in lovely colour cinematography whenever anyone bursts into music or song the film makes for a joyous occasion the natural highlight of the film is gene kelly s cartoon adventures in a fantasyland climaxing in a brilliant dance with jerry the mouse this is a well deserved masterpiece number of kelly s career and it s nice to know he thought of it before fred astaire started taking to dancing on walls and ceilings it s not exactly sitting down to a triple flavour rainbow sprinkled chocolate wafer cream and cherry and banana split sundae but it is a square solid lump of sugar that somehow eventually melts in your mouth and despite the guilt is still a pleasant feeling rating
now i ve always been a fan of full moon s puppet work but i have to say that robot jox is one of there better projects yes you heard me the story works wonderful the atmosphere really works and the actors do a first rate job gary graham who really makes his mark on tv in shows like alien nation the series and star trek enterprise shows that he can be an action star who kicks ass and takes name the stop motion effects could have been a tiny bit better the color was wrong they look plastic to me instead of the metal they were suppose to be but that is a minor complaint compared to the whole that is the robot jox if you like gary graham or other full moon movies then you will like this movie stars out of
quite a heartwarming little film and not just for the kids john thaw is brilliant as always without any hint of inspector morse about him the boy playing william did a good job as well though i didn t find him convincing in every scene i loved the whole feel of the small village and the slower pace of life in those times i also felt the scenes in london where historically accurate as far as i could tell it strongly reminded me of a scandinavian film i saw a couple of years ago called mother of mine that film featured a boy being evacuated from finland to sweden during ww ii the wife of the family taking him in asked for a girl because as it turns out she lost her daughter getting a boy instead she completely ignores him the fact that the boy speaks finnish complicates matters even further i highly recommend that film to anyone who enjoyed goodnight mr tom it has the same feel to it
its a shame she didn t get screen credit she by far did the best job in the film has the girl on the cross best part of the movie she had much more impact than avril or just about anyone else in the film she almost made s m look like fun she really was believable has the s m model that gets scared of her situation although they seem to really have messed up that sort of dreamy feeling of looking for the bad guy those sets were very well built but they just sort of skimmed the surface of what was shot this is one film were both cuts should be made available it seems they left out a lot of what was shot and almost all of the really dark stuff that would have made the film much more demented its kind of like they stopped short of the mark they were going for during filming what was shot would not have gotten a r rating probably a nc or x but that is what it would have needed to make the film they way it should have been
life begins is a wonderful pre code film starring some of the best of the era it is set in the maternity ward of a hospital particularly in the room for the women expected to have trouble in it is an older woman a tough unwed mother glenda farrell a frail young woman an italian woman and the main character loretta young who is spending years in prison for murder her husband eric linden is at the hospital at every second aching to know that everything will be okay aline macmahone plays the nurse who is great at her job this film is highly interesting and entertaining it isn t terribly shocking in any way but it is interesting to see such a neglected subject on the silver screen the acting is brilliant all around loretta young is gorgeous here in her prime eric linden comes out of nowhere and is sincere as can be his innocence is reminiscent of michael j fox glenda farrell is great as always a staple of pre codes and for good reason

i bellied up to the bar expecting this to be a hot beer on a sweltering texas day but was pleasantly surprised after suffering through saturday night foolishness i had no desire to see a re make in some south texas barnyard and i didn t john revolta was good as the jealous redneck scott glenn was well cast as a thuggie ex con and debra winger was as always a delight love that woman plus the soundtrack was dynamite and this comes from a guy that can t stand the sound of country music a fun film all the way
this movie reminded me that some old black white movies are definitely worth the look initially i had some reservations however from the beginning of the movie until the end i was captivated i was very impressed with the mixture of drama suspense comedy arthur askey tommy gander is hilarious and had me in stitches the whole time definitely add this movie to your movie night for some light relief from the sometimes depressing and too powerful or overly funny movies of today
this movie is the best film ever i can t remember the last time a movie has drawn tears out of me with a tear in my eye i admire this movie it has all the elements that a good movie must have excellent dialogues music acting story plot a story of friendship courage kindliness and loyalty between a street performing who famous to the king of masks and a little girl that sold as a boy in serf bazaar little girl liked to be his granddaughter and king of masks liked a grandson they were not conventional in real every scene they were together was priceless the camera work is flawless and grips you the acting is inspired xu zhu was excellent as the king of masks renying zhou doggie looks pretty and played her character very well zhigang zhao as liang sao lang was great he played his helpful and kindhearted character extremely well if you have t this movie try it once do watch it
for a low budget project the film was a success the story is interesting and the actors were convincing eva longoria who now stars on the tv show dragnet is sexier than ever the locations were ideal for the ganster plot and the director shows his talent by taking on many roles for his project of course this low budget film could use better editing transitions and more special effects for the gun scenes but the music keeps this script moving although this film has it s share of problems such as continuity i must say that i would rent the director s next movie if your a film student you could learn a few things from the director s commentary
i just viewed the film two days ago and i was filled with anticipation being that paris is my second favorite city in europe and i spent a very romantic months there in the s i was somewhat disappointed that most of this group of vignettes while original and artistically done did not capture the light and beauty of the city very well nor enough of the romance we saw none of the tree lined boulevards there was too much darkness not only literally but figuratively some of the plots manipulated the viewer it seemed and let him her down flat the marais sequence the coiffure salesman sequence to give two examples the uplifting good ones the mime sequence the cemetery the montmartre though it left too much to the viewer to comprehend the cowboy vignette and the sacre coeur seemed few and far between and i would have liked to have seen such a wonderful actor as orlando bloom be in something that would have showcased his originality more
so fox pulled the plug midway through a drama mystery how lame is that do they expect us to invest our time in their new shows when there is a realistic risk of never finding out what happens why weren t the remaining already filmed episodes aired in the us they were broadcast elsewhere hey fox are you listening this was a great show but you left us hanging if you re going to introduce new drama mysteries at least air a conclusion before abruptly ending mid theme every time something like this happens and it seems to happen a lot with you i e fox there are more of those who will wait and see before investing their time this means you will see an artificially low interest share and are more likely to end the series see it is a vicious cycle don t let us down again
alan curtis has a loud violent sounding argument with his wife slams out of his apartment has a night of drinking with a mysterious lady with a large hat in a bar run by andrew tombes in a nice villainous part for a change and returns to find his wife dead and the police led by thomas gomez waiting for him his attempts to prove his alibi that he was with that mysterious lady fall because everyone that he can think of tombes elisha cook claims there was never any such person he ends up with no alibi although his secretary who secretly loves him ellen raines believes him convicted after a trial he is awaiting his death sentence raines starts going out after the truth discovering that gomez has some doubts of his own she also finds an ally in a friend of curtis franchot tone who was apparently out of town the night of the crime will she clear curtis in time the phantom lady is based on a novel by william irish the great noir writer cornell woolrich as movie fans know from other works by woolrich leopard man the night has a thousand eyes rear window no man of her own one cannot assume what is true on the surface anywhere the missing wife of a salesman may not actually be upstate sending him messages that she arrived if he still has her jewelry the mentalist may really be able to predict tragedy or was he plotting the murder of his old partner now an oil millionaire did a leopard kill the young women or is the wealthy recluse in town actually hiding some guilty knowledge is the young woman claiming to be the wife of a brother killed in a train wreck actually an impostor here it is raines and gomez with an assist by tone trying to prove curtis did see a woman nobody will admit seeing and if he did see her why is nobody else able to recall seeing her the problem with the story really is curtis s personality he gives in too easily when found guilty of the crime he did not commit in reality anyone who is innocent would be screaming it to the moment they are executed however in defense of curtis s collapse it also happens to other people in various films gary cooper in mr deeds goes to town gets so disgusted about the framing he gets as delusional and mad by douglas dumbrille and his minions that he does not defend himself at first until the people who would depend on his help cry out their fears in the courtroom and reawaken his sense of responsibility but curtis just seems to give up in normal circumstances raines gomez and everyone else would not care if curtis didn t but the film survives this weakness the slow unraveling of lies by witnesses bribed by the real killer allows two set pieces for raines with tombes on a deserted elevated platform and elisha cook at a jazz session gomez turns out to be more perceptive than the villain expects in double checking his alibi again and the villain manages to keep slightly ahead of raines and gomez until the concluding minutes of the film if it is not as great a film as double indemnity or the postman always rings twice or the maltese falcon it holds up pretty well until the moment curtis and raines are reunited at the end
i enjoyed this movie and i had very low expectation due to all the negative reviews i read before going i went because i was curious as to what all this fuss was about because some of the postings were so angry with this movie and with the koreans oh and it s from korea which has put out some of my favorite movies i liked host but not my absolute favorite some of my favorite sci fi fantasy movies so you can have a sense of my taste mirrormask stardust serenity gattaca willow matrix resident evil series lotr stargate dark city it wasn t confusing like everyone said and the monsters looked good and the battles great there are some holes in the story but didn t really matter i sort of tune out stuff like that and stopped asking why long time ago when i see summer blockbusters the korean legend was interesting the reincarnation stuff was different and i thought the main characters suspiciously dressed like korean actors in other shows ethan s behr hair looked so asian yes it could be better and i hope in the future that korea with its unusual quirky sense of life intense emotions and unexpected humor can bring some diversity to the blockbuster genre maybe a combination of host and dragon wars in the future

got to be one of the best political satires i have seen to date with an excellent performance for cusak tomei and all the supporting actors excellent plot very well placed and a very good unexpected twist at the end the action scenes were well filmed choreographed very funny all in all i give this film a big thumbs up it s extremely critical of us military intervention in the middle east and as such it may receive bad reviews from people who don t share the same political view or those who are simply too politically ignorant to appreciate the dark and drk humour indeed at places the comedy was so close to the truth that it was borderline between funny and tragic
financially strapped paramount pulled out all the stops for this stage adaptation entry big budget large cast extravagant production and mitch leisen tagged as the director what happened two things busby berkeley didn t work for the out of focus rock and a murder mystery script that didn t deserve to be in the same trash can as the worst charlie chan first draft down the street i have to believe that the cutting was out of leisen s hands since the great duke ellington s number is savagely chopped but that doesn t mean that it ain t worth a look the sweet marihuana number featuring topless chorus girls is a mind blower considering the looming production code and it also has the ravishing toby wing whose unfortunately fed horrible lines and playing the prototype dumb blonde as a chorion hot for an otherwise preoccupied jack oakie carl brisson s acting is bland as melba toast but he s a competent singer maclaglen reaches for new plateaus as a stereotypical dumb detective and try to spot lucy in the chorus this rates a as a curiosity feb re think i recently gave the film another look and now feel i was wrong to berate the lack of busby berkeley production numbers i can understand leisen s argument for more realistic production numbers within the context of the plot i still have enormous issues with the editing however paramount the raciest major studio in town faced huge issues with the production code at the worst possible time in it s history financially speaking and pulled out all the stops on this one also check out s search for beauty a must see for pre code buffs
apart from the usual stereotypes of the thirties eugene pallette as the gruff police detective jack la rue as the swarthy italian and of course james lee as the chinese cook this film is the great mystery of a murder in a locked room for an early s film this step by step peeling of the veneer of the mystery is similar to the columbo series except in this film you don t have the advantage of knowing who the killer was in advance
well for starters this actually was the most elegant clausen film to this date the man s always got a sense for characters with a slice of humor to them but i think that he in this movie adds a dimension unparrallel to anything he s made earlier his work has in very black n white words been accepted by the broad but not that critical audience and we ve always appreciated his sense of humor and his ability to mix it with human problems and a distinct way of letting the audience know what he needs to say in villa paranoia however for the first time he surprises with an unseen wisdom and a respect for the minorities not only the ethnic but also the normal people you tend to forget set in jutland in the country it deals with the everlasting issue of lack of love but in a close and at times brutal way that keeps you looking and keeps you focused and on top of that he himself manages to play a b d a true b d who wants the right thing but has no clue how to get there and people therefore suffer bitterly i d have to say it s one of the best movies i ve seen this year and i m greatly anticipating his next
i ll come clean the only reason i even found out about this dvd was because dominic monaghan is a favorite actor of mine when i heard the title of the film i thought it was going to be different perhaps in not such a good way but i was wrong after reading what few reviews were out there about this short i was actually excited about seeing it i sent off for my copy as soon as able and received it a few weeks later needless to say i was not disappointed the film follows jack a insomniac who is often plagued by conditions which causes him to doubt what is reality and what is all in his head i won t give away what happens but i will tell you that the film can sometimes be frightening in it s realism the directing is fantastic focusing on what is essential to the story without allowing it to lose any entertainment or thought provoking moments all in all i give this great film out of for going far beyond what i thought any short could achieve
i would highly recommend this movie and i certainly shall be personally recommending it to my friends and family here and abroad it was with excited anticipation that i have just pre ordered it online i enjoyed it so much it is not out until february march but it will be well worth the wait but first go and see it in the cinema if you can there is nothing quite like the cinema experience of a cinema made movie insist that your local cinema puts it on i went to see seachd the inaccessible pinacle tonight down here in london and was really impressed it is a marvel a truly beautiful film set in the scottish highlands you will laugh you will cry you will be moved in may different ways you will be intrigued and as the story within the stories is revealed you will be amazed at that revelation this movie is in scottish gaelic with english subtitles but do not let that detract you if you are not a speaker of the gaelic i am just starting and my son does not nor did many people there tonight and it did not spoil it for us by any manner of means superlatives do not suffice the photography is superb there is no cgi here and the movie is all the better for that here you have true photography the script is so skilfully and subtly written the many layered plot weaves the magic art of the ancient storytellers the music is at times rousing at times haunting but always adding to the atmospheric ambiance and the acting it is to behold and the actors they the true weavers of this delightful yet profound film particularly the two main actors padruig the young and padruig the elder a true bard if ever there was who both carried a very heavy load and the direction well watch out richard and the producer responsible for raising funding hiring key personnel and arranging for distributors a task well done i hope that you will make sure that distribution goes out to our communities abroad and the gaelic community uill without you it could not have happened we were told that this movie was made on a low budget but you would not know it and i think it might well be because for what they might have lacked in money they more than made up for with the richness of the heart and the warmth and co operation of the local scottish gaelic community a heartfelt thanks to all concerned in the making and the sponsoring of seachd m ran taing many thanks from the gaels to the world from the world to the gaels
the story and music george gershwin are wonderful as are levant guetary foch and of course kelly one thing s missing and that thing is a good leading lady i m sorry leslie caron bothers me anyway despite her the plot moves along nicely with the famous and deservedly so ballet oh the colours the dazzling reds blues greens and yellows musn t forget the beiges as well i just adore the contrast between the beaux arts ball completely black and white costumes and the ever so brilliant ballet so i suppose what i m trying to say is this please by all means see it and enjoy it because though it isn t the best it is marvelous but be sure not to forget that other gene kelly musical with the year old girl that was catapulted to stardom just afterward

this is surprisingly above average slasher that s enjoyable and well made with some decent gore all the characters are decent and the story is quite fun plus molly ringwald played the annoying bitch extremely well i bought this at a pawn shop for a and it was surprisingly worth it and the special effects were pretty damn good for the budget plus i loved the mask the killer wore as it was actually somewhat creepy the finale was really cool as i loved how they defeated the killer and the ending while predictable was very amusing as well plus all the characters except for ringwald were surprisingly pretty likable it s decently made and written and i thought it was quite creative and original at times as well plus some of the death scenes were very impressive this killer didn t mess around and i loved it and slasher fans like myself should really enjoy this film plus the opening was really wicked too with them filming the movie this is a surprisingly above average slasher that s enjoyable and well made with some decent gore and i say it s well worth the watch the direction is good kimble rendall does a good job here with solid camera work using a creepy setting good angles and keeping the film at a fast moving pace the acting is solid molly ringwald plays the bitch extremely well and i had troubles feeling sorry for her after all she was supposed to be the heroine she turned out better towards the end but not by much i m surprised she decided to do this film nonetheless she did an excellent job frank roberts is fantastic as the killer he is menacing creepy and had one hell of a mask and this guy didn t mess around he was fantastic kylie minogue plays a bitch very well in her small role jessica napier is cute and does fine as the other heroine rest of the cast are fine overall well worth the watch out of
dark angel is a futuristic sci fi series set in post apocalyptic seattle centering on max jessica alba a genetically enhanced young woman on the run from her creators the dark angel universe is absorbing not as much as say buffy but absorbing nonetheless with an interesting and believable set of characters certainly it is not for everyone but those who give it time will find themselves watching one of the most enjoyable series out there dark angel is criminally overlooked and under rated and was unfortunatly canceled after only series which was a great shame as this had the potential to become a great series although its episodes are only shy of long running bbc sci fi comedy red dwarf as it is dark angel remains unfinished so seek it out and if you want more lobby fox to make another series
amazing grace has a languid feel to it as it tells a contemporary story of various lives in an apartment building the language spoken is hebrew but the drama could take place in any modern city it observes family values romantic relationships and age group characteristics with equal aplomb it does not judge the characters only present them in a straight forward manner as they strive to work out their individual problems in this modern world the quality of acting is very good and the observations made on the characters are astute and sharp i appreciate this flowing film very much
having read the reviews for this film i understandably started watching it with a great deal of doubt in my mind that it would actually be any good however this is one of the best films i have seen in a long time the majority of reviews that i had read said that the complicated plot made it too hard to follow and whilst some parts do leave you confused the ending ties up so many loose ends that you feel like kicking yourself because you ve missed so much it s not like lock stock or snatch in the sense that it isn t that funny in fact it s pretty dark and it is a lot more intelligent in the way that you see parts of scenes from different viewpoints and in one of the best scenes of the film jason statham spends five minutes in a lift having an argument with himself the way in which it is similar to the two films i just mentioned is that it is full of memorable characters specifically statham who gives a fantastic performance as the lead and ray liotta who spends most of the film in speedos but gives a great performance none the less if you ve got time and have time afterwards to think about the film and even watch it again you really start to see all the symbolism and hints that are laid out through the film i think it s fantastic and that guy ritchie is a director on top of his game
ralph and mumford misfits in their own land get duped into being unwitting pawns of synanomess botch twice upon a time is the story of them the characters they meet and their struggle to set things right with a surprisingly impressive soundtrack and wonderful voice acting by some of the best in the business this offbeat movie hits the mark the animation process while similar to that of the cut out south park style is much smoother and far more three dimensional if i didn t know that the animation was this style i would swear that is was traditional pen and ink if you can watch this film in dolby surround or thx please do you won t really miss anything if you don t but if you do you will get much more out of the experience
picking up right after the moscow showdown of supremacy this is bourne s greatest adventure and his final climax throughout the tight min runtime the movie takes bourne from russia to madrid paris marocco and ultimately new york damon is every inch of the hard trained killer robert ludlum imagined he is the most deadly spy in the movies right now and it s the underpinned emotions to his character that makes him so believable and it s exactly the fine way damon manages to combine these two polar opposites of himself that s so breathtaking in this third bourne is on a mission to save his soul and while watching it ultimatum delivers such an high octane performance that you ll find yourself sweating and gasping over its truly powerful branch of ideas and pull offs just look out for two great car chases and a fight scene as realistic as bond vs shaw back in director greengrass has surpassed himself with this compelling thriller and this is probably as exciting as cinema thrillers get a true pay off to bourne fans and a new breed of spy thriller standard
this is an excellent film for female body builder female action fans i think that sue price did a great job in this film series nemesis and proved to be a great fighter she has a very striking appearance and a will of iron to resist the powerful nebula nemesis though not a film of great value and sue price s acting skills not the best to have met in my life the movie itself was something awesome a priceless gem for fans of female body builder action well some parts of nemesis have been copied by other famous sci fi films such as terminator or predator but that s not the point the point is that a puyn casted in that film a very talented body builder who put all of her energy and body talent to show us the best she can do i really enjoyed that film and watched with the same enthusiasm nemesis a rather boring sequel and nemesis a much more interesting sequel than what a pity it hasn t shown yet on dvd
most s and s kong kong martial arts films barely function as movies usually there are a few well planned fight sequences but the plot is scraped pretty thin to fill in the gaps between those nodes like porno films really but this one does several things well most overtly there is the direction and choreography which confines each combatant to a style it s really based on chinese circus acrobatics and comedic theater but the effect works second there is the language of the camera which uses some impressive techniques even by today s measure changing projection speeds from real time time to slow motion and from unfiltered to filtered views to depict story direction toward the past or toward the future least overt but most powerful and unexpected is the construction the winner of this contest is determined by who unfolds the story the master the writer sets up a game where the lead character doesn t know who he s seeking which is the same situation we viewers find ourselves in one by one he figures out who is who at the same rate we find out who is who it all follows a tragedy noir arc the ending tends toward irony a la the sting much more clever stuff than what we usually get out of this genre the five venoms idea is the template for tarantino s deadly viper assassins from the kill bill volumes
yet again early morning television proves an invaluable resource for films that i otherwise would never have been able to track down at four o clock in the morning i stumbled out of bed to begin recording the informer my fourth film from prolific american director john ford and an excellent one at that set during the irish civil war in the screenplay was adapted by dudley nichols from the novel of the same name by liam o flaherty though he was born in the united states and is most renowned for his americana pictures both of ford s parents were irish which explains the director s decision to direct the film victor mclaglen plays gypo nolan a brutish but well meaning ruffian who informs on an old friend frankie mcphillip wallace ford in order to claim the reward for his girlfriend katie margot grahame when frankie is killed during his attempted arrest the irish republican army of which both frankie and gypo were members begins to investigate the traitor behind the incident every clue bringing them closer and closer to the real culprit meanwhile gypo is plagued with guilt for his friend s untimely death and descends into a bout of heavy drinking that rivals don birnam in the lost weekend in its excessiveness as gypo drowns his sorrows in copious volumes of alcohol trapped in a vicious little circle of depression his extravagant spending captures the attention of the investigating ira members for the one time in his life gypo finds himself surrounded by admirers including an amusing j m kerrigan who enthusiastically clap him on the back and christen him king gypo for his physical might however it s obvious that these people feel no affection for the man and are simple showing him attention to exploit him for money the additional brought by frankie s death could never buy gypo an assembly of friends indeed in a bitter twist of irony the money was only made possible by the betrayal and loss of one of his only good companions a relatively simple fellow gypo could not possibly have fully considered the consequences of his actions and is eventually offered forgiveness on account of his not knowing what he was doing but his foolishness must not go unpunished criticism is occasionally levelled at ford s film for its allegedly propagandistic support of a terrorist organisation though this stance obviously depends on one s personal views i certainly don t know enough irish history to pass judgement there s no doubt that the film portrays the irish republican army as selfless dedicated and impartial a proud piece of irish patriotism if i ever saw it however the main theme of the story is that of betrayal driven by intense poverty one ordinary man betrays the confidence of his good friend and comes to deeply regret his actions the tormented gypo is played mainly for pity and victor mclaglen gives a powerful performance that betrays a lifetime of unsatisfying existence culminating in one terrible decision that condemns him to an uneasy death the informer was john ford s first major oscar success winning a total of four awards from six nominations including best actor for mclaglen who snatched the statue from the three way favourites of mutiny on the bounty best director and best screenplay for dudley nichols who declined the award due to union disagreements
you sit there for a half an hour and watch a story believing it all then watch another half an hour of the same story utterly unraveling and then put back together again brilliant one of the most exciting feature films at the san francisco international film festival is a documentary i don t know if other than andrew jarecki s capturing the friedmans there has ever been anything like anna broinowski s forbidden lie it features exposes defends reveals and questions everything about norma khouri author of honor lost the acclaimed and lambasted bestseller about honor killings in jordan what is quite incredible and what makes the film so exceptional is that this exposure of khouri is made with khouri s full participation for the initial portion of the film khouri presents her story about the supposed honor killing of a friend of hers in amman the story of the book she sounds completely believable convincing then her story is taken apart exposed by eminently believable and convincing people such as women s rights activists in jordan investigative reporters there and in australia where khouri lived for a while khouri comes back and denies the accusations taking a successful lie detector test in the process there comes another segment of devastating exposures not to be specified here because that would lessen the shock value and then khouri comes back and faces the accusations not all but the essential ones in the matter of the book and the houdini act continues with round after round in this heavy weight seesaw prize fight surprise after surprise and there is no happy ending in the sense of resolution brilliant

paul reiser did a spectacular job in writing this movie peter falk gives the performance of his life it is worthy of an academy award this was one of the most poignant and funny movies of the year reiser s wit is fantastic and he is as good as it gets and as he was in his long running tv sitcom mad about you peter falk did a masterful job as his dad and peter who is now years young made us laugh and cry at the same time the supporting cast was equal to the task especially the gorgeous gorgeous elizabeth perkins it is a must see movie for we bet that everyone across all ages and religions will love this movie and somehow relate to it in one way or another we have mothers and fathers and siblings like these in the movie we have all had the good and bad times together and wish things were the same but different
the quintessential georgian film of georgi danelia ne goryuy aka don t grieve is loosely based on the novel by french writer claude tillier mon oncle benjamin the novel takes place in the country side of the th century france the great french revolution is still ahead but some of its stormy signs are present in society benjamin the local doctor is a soul of a local society the educated friendly democratic person who often treats the poor for free it makes him very popular with the locals but most certainly does not help with his bank account he is in love with a beautiful manette who is also crazy about him but is being watched closely by her father who called his daughter his small capital and is determined to protect her virginity until the moment the marriage contract has been signed i never read the book and from description it sounds like a charming very french novel but i am fascinated with the results of moving the characters and some plot elements from th century france to the beginning of th century georgia grusiya i would think that it was danelia who came up with all the colorful memorable characters that feel so much at home in his native georgia grusiya the land of long and wonderful traditions including art of making and drinking wine rare music talent that all georgians seem to possess very unique humor and high code of honor when we watched the film last night together with my husband he said what a great example of an art film and i so agree with him don t grieve is a perfect art movie visually beautiful deep but funny at times sad and philosophical but never in a preachy arrogant way but optimistic celebrating life with all its beauty and sadness full of interest loving irony and understanding for its slightly eccentric but very human characters what is the most important the film is warm and gentle it does not look down at its viewers as some of the art pictures do you don t have to be a movie buff to love it to live with it to smile and sigh at it to follow the good hearted young doctor benjamin first role in a danelia film of famous singer and actor wachtang kikabidze with whom danelia would go on to make two more films including one of my all time favorites mimino on his journey through the roads and mountains of georgia or to be a guest on one of a kind party where the friends gather to celebrate life of the old doctor levan who wanted to be a guest on his own wake to hear what his friends have to say about him when he dies while he is still alive and who gets to choose which color he prefers for his coffin when i watched the film i thought that it is a sort of movie that federico fellini might have liked i was not surprised at all to find the article about danelia where he names fellini his number one director i also found out that according danelia the famous soviet directors leonid gaiday the creator of many beloved comedies and sergei paraszhanov the visionary whom i don t have to introduce loved another danelia s film fairy tale about american boy huck finn sovsem propashchiy felt and spoke negatively about don t grieve while fellini praised it highly i dare go a little further and just guess that perhaps maestro fellini kept in mind some images and the very aura and atmosphere of don t grieve when he was making amrarcord in just a thought because there is something essential that connects both films both artists came back to their roots to the places that they love deeply to the people they remembered loved and wanted to honor both films have a lot of smiles through the tears both are art movies that would get directly to the hearts of the viewers both are masterworks i think i am going to add georgi danelia to the list of my favorite directors he has made some of the brilliant pictures in my most favorite genre of dramedy even tragicomedies that are funny and bitter sweet poignant and subtle earthy and uplifting gentle and shining when i looked up the list of the movies he has written directed i was amazed at the fact that he has not made a single bad film since he started back in with the award winning story of a young boy seryozha many of danelia s films are among my favorites as i am sure they are among his legions of fans the man behind seryozha sovsem propashchiy which is an adaptation of mark twain the adventures of huckleberry finn ya shagayu po moskve aka walking the streets of moscow ne goryuy aka don t grieve afonya mimino osenniy marafon aka autumn marathon or sad comedy which is a very fitting title for this movie as well as for the whole genre that danelia practically invented and the cult favorite for over years kin dza dza is brilliant and deserves our true love and genuine gratitude for the unforgettable moments of cinematic happiness
the movie was excellent save for some of the scenes with esposito i enjoyed how it brought together every detective on the series and wrapped up some plotlines that were never resolved during the series thanks to nbc it was great to see pembleton and bayliss together at their most human and most basic persons braugher and secor did a great job but as usual will get overlooked it hurt to see that this was the end of homicide memories tapes and reruns on courttv just aren t the same as watching it come on every friday but the movie did its job and did it very well presenting a great depiction of life after al retired and the family relationship that existed between the unit i enjoyed this a lot
i had never seen a silent movie until july i had never seen a movie with mary pickford in it i ve seen thousands of movies very few are hypnotic to me i found last of the mohicans and unforgettable ray liotta to be hypnotic so consider the source as you read this i started watching tess of the storm country on tcm just to see who this mary pickford was who has been credited by many for launching hollywood i had no idea what i was in for two hours later i snapped out of it and realized i d watched one of the most beautiful women i had ever seen playing a role perfectly suited to her imagine a movie fan in having never seen anyone that gorgeous and that expressive before you would have to see her again and again the setting was perfect for a girl that expressive she was a poor squatter couldn t speak the king s english but you had to admire her what a movie time to start my mary pickford movie collection
i just got puzzled why damn fox canceled the season although season was not as good as season which is excellent indeed i like it so much that i even thinking about buying dvd on amazon failed i am a chinese student and it s inconvenient for me to get a international credit card and i just hope fox can bring back da someday somehow
i realize that alot of people hate this movie but i must admit that it is one of my favorites i happen to like it better then its predeccesor and happy to like it better than alot of movies first off i think that people never give the story any credit much like back to the future time travel is hard to write and in this movie they included time travel and a spiritual journey i also feel that keanu and alex were on there best performances in this movie they looked cooler acted cooler and said cooler things the set design of this movie is awsome as well the sets are quite detailed and massive at times and it can be hard to believe that these sets were made for a movie about two teenage buds who can hardly spell but isnt that the genius of the whole franchise making these two idiots bigger than life characters that are responsible for the entire utopian future of earth the costume design was awsome as well bill and ted actually look cool in bogus journey where as in excellent adventure they look rather like well as they would put it fags even the music in this movie is awsome the score especially there so much i could say about this film cause i love it but this is one of those movies i grew up watching and everytime i did i liked it more so i can understand why people hate or just think its bogus compared to excellent adventure which i also love by the way get down with your bad self
as an adult i really did enjoy this one i watched it with my granddaughters and the year old was fascinated and the month old giggled at the mice the music is fun and the animation is wonderful this sequel does what return to neverland didn t accomplish a good follow up to the cinderella story but what becomes of drusilla another sequel i hope so
what an amazing film with very little dialogue the whole story is told with glances and body language very involving almost voyeuristic my only gripe is that it has not been released on video in australia and is therefore only available on tv what a waste
comparable to fight club the matrix a i sixth sense among others this film approaches the psyche in a way never done before the first minutes builds a interesting love story between diaz cruise cruz the rest of the movie is well confusing you ll pick more every time you watch it i ve gone to the movies to see it times now
not only do the storylines in the sopranos engage audiences from all over but i think for me at least what brings the viewers back is the acting not even you gary can dispute that claim james gandolfini who plays the lead man tony soprano has become in this viewer s opinion one of the hollywood elites as far as acting in a television series goes i wouldn t go ahead and compare him with robert deniro or al pacino or at least not just yet he however does do a hell of a job playing the part of tony soprano in the years since gandolfini has risen so much so as an actor mainly thanks to his role in the sopranos that today he is considered to be among the best in the business and it s not just him the sopranos fields a great supporting cast including that of lorraine bracco edie falco michael imperioli dominic chianese and the late nancy marchand who played tony s dreadful mother at this point in the show s existence it s being considered a cult classic and rightfully so the first two seasons were extraordinary violent and quite gruesome in a pretty frequent manner but without a doubt extraordinarily done the third season was great but didn t quite live up to the hype of seasons and season which wrapped up right before new years was the weakest season yet or at least in my opinion it was despite a dry spell i still found it season of the sopranos to be more entertaining than most of its competition and that s saying a lot because lately i ve been noticing a trend in good new television shows examples of this six feet under the shield curb your enthusiasm and oz which is not technically a new show but ended with an unforgettable final season this year to get back to my point though to consider a show better than all the competition during a particularly bad year no less is quite an accomplishment on the part of the writers the sopranos ranks above and beyond all other television shows in its era and its writers deserve a lot of credit to close i d like to say the sopranos is the real deal folks for the average mature viewer and above who enjoys drama and doesn t mind a mixing of a little violence and profanity you might want to check out the sopranos if you get the chance trust me in that it will be well worth the time
i saw this film with a special screening of the work of owen alik shahadah it is so interesting where did this guy come from now he is probably the key independent african filmmaker in the world and i am not talking about black filmmakers i am talking about filmmakers who are rooted in culture the idea if anything testifies to the diversity and range of african themes with his film years later it is a african issue but the idea doesn t fit that mold showing the artistic diversity the film is an all african cast but the topic is a human topic which most of us could relate to i just love the mild comedy in it and the kora of tunde jegede is just amazing it is really a art house gem
this movie was a classic i would have to say that this movie caught the best of a working man who learns from his mistakes if we could all get along and learn the way everyone in this movie did it had an important part of showing how family is an important part of life and how pride can cause you to lose something important in life if we can not find a big throat and swallow are pride
i am quite the mitchell leisen fan so it was a great anticipation that i rented this movie but the print i got was extremely bad so worn down from use and scorched seemingly beyond repair the movie was so dark so dark that in certain scenes that are cinematographed in the dark you can t see a single thing that said i believe i share the same opinion as the first review of this movie it starts out unusually and does not tote the lines and rhythms of your typical hollywood s movie heck not even your typical hollywod movie of any era it seems the director has been influenced by the europeans because there is a certain caustic realism to the proceedings from the opening shot which is so crafted in camera movement and placement as maggie carole lombard and skid fred macmurray meet you half expect them to start singing make believe from show boat it starts with a few laughs and poor anthony in a one scene role where he speaks not a word of english gets slapped around by freddie skids is a bum who doesn t care that he s a bum that s why he signs up in the army where he can hide from the world he s just been released though and in a set of screenplay shenanigans she misses her boat for new york this is when the movie kicks into high gear and we begin to get those french movie of the sixties vibes to the whole proceedings the scenes are so well acted by lombard and cecil cunningham the movie gains a pulse macmurray is good too as he and lombard fall for each other as she nurtures his talent for the trumpet then the temptress arrives in the form of dorothy lamour enough with plot the movie has fantastic montage sequences that dazzled me they are very good and lombard scores a home run in this movie but in the second half a bit more is called of freddie and he fails to deliver the goods with a heavily melodramatic ending and an actor you don t believe the movie falls short but since it is not your typical movie in structure set design and direction it is worth a look for what is what it was one of the hits of the season i don t know its exact rank though
it s one of the best movies i ve seen in the last years i ve seen the premier in tel aviv israel in the summer of exactly when the last war has began this problem in communication between the people that causes wars is interesting me for a long time and it doesn t matter who boys and girls straight and gays jews and arabs i ve seen the bubble already times and it still surprising and exciting me each character reminds me of one of the many people i know and the difference between them like between tel aviv and jerusalem the last time i saw it was with my friend who is a christian arab and it was on the independence day of israel the most symbolic i could how ironic and he cried in the end if he s been touched and wasn t embarrassed everyone would be touched by the bubble
i saw this at a screening last night too i was totally blown away at how much better this movie was than what i expected not many movies can combine dark comedy and current event drama and not have it fall apart in the conclusion i won t bother rehashing the plot too much because i think the less you know about this movie going into it makes it that much better but i will say that adam sandler s performance was really refreshing and real he was funny and much funnier than most of his most recent comedies don cheadle was believable as always this movie isn t funny like borat or billy madison but it has a good pace about it i d say of the audience laughed for most of the film midway through the movie slows down to address the drama end of things and does a really nice job of tying it all together i also thought it was really cool how instead of playing up the whole black friend white friend thing they chose to just ignore it and focus on the relationships themselves
one of the best comedy series to ever come out of britain mark gatiss reece shearsmith and steve pemberton are terrific actors and performers who seem at home with drama as they are with comedy ably supported by their writing partner jeremy dyson they have peopled the series with the most memorable characters of recent years little britain pales into insignificance as a poor imitation of their ideas consistently original and groundbreaking i am sure that as many people hate these series as love them but i am equally as sure that no one could have no opinion on log i have yet to see the feature length movie but i have heard good things and bad things so i will reserve judgement the original radio series from which log came was as innovative as the tv series became i don t know whether the tv series made it to the us but i would be fascinated to see how american audiences found the weird englishness of the humour
h g wells story the shape of things to come was made into a movie in very well made science fiction tale about a war that lasts for decades great cast includes raymond massey arsenic and old lace sir cedric hardwick ghost of frankenstein ralph richardson time bandits and margaretta scott early glimpses of helicopters holograms a rocket ship and futuristic cities this film was ahead of its time directed by william cameron menzies invaders from mars its very enjoyable much like the earlier movie metropolis but avoid the so called sequel the shape of things to come that was made in this movie has nothing to do with the original h g wells like jules verne had a vision for the future with his stories a classic science fiction movie out of
for starters i have always been a fan of the batman cartoons because the theme is so universal that everyone alive has an alter ego this is true in the mystery of batwoman while the overall story is good i m disappointed that they haven t really done much for the franchise with this throughout the movie you are trying to find out who the identity of batwoman is unfortunately you can find out by easily looking at the cast of credits posted on this website so if you haven t seen it already don t go there i was sort of disappointed that they didn t make the movie longer minutes is way too short for any movie the secret identity of batwoman also comes far too early in the movie sort of midway and becomes anti climatic afterward because you know the good guys will always win and that the new character known as batwoman will disappear after the movie is over i m also not too sure about the new animation style used in this movie i love the sleek new characters but there should be some more detail where detail is called for some parts of the animation look so awkward and rigid that it grabs your attention right away diverting your attention away from the storyline i also didn t really like the bright atmosphere used in most of the scenes it sort of loses its dark and gothic feel which is batman similarly we should ve gotten to know more about batwoman s personality so that we can build the same deep compassionate feeling that we do with bruce wayne also i think the fight with bane should have been done better in typical children s fashion the bad guy meets his demise too easily either by tripping falling getting electricuted or doing something dumb that works against them come to think of it there wasn t even one drop of blood spilled in this movie either bottom line its a good entertaining flick and i recommend anyone who s a batman fan to watch it it has good storyline universal appeal and even great acting to top it off i just wish that they could have delivered more permanent change to the story by making batwoman stay to make things more interesting not just introduce her and then kick her off once she s done i d also like to see someone else figure out the mystery for a change finally to have some other than batman solve the mystery and fill him in later with the details i hope there are more animated movies to come and look forward to the time when we will actually be able to see the breakup between bruce wayne and barbra gordan he s been stringing her along forever and doesn t even like her and i can t believe that she was dumb enough to fall in love with someone years older i also want to see the time when tim drake leaves because he is getting sick of the old man in short i want to see all of the things that led the characters to where they will be in batman beyond otherwise the same repeated formula will just end it faster than if they just decided to move on with the story
this is a very dark and intriguing horror type thriller based on the idea of religious murders the storyline centres on a deranged man who lives in texas us who suddenly goes on a killing spree with his two young sons after being instructed by god to redeem the world of bad people bill paxton who directs this movie plays the deranged father who is known as the hand of god killer while matthew mcconaughey plays his finest performances to date as the oldest son fenton meiks the film revolves around fenton who decides he can no longer hold the burden of his murderous childhood alone and uses flashbacks to hauntingly tell the story to fbi agent wesley doyle played by powers boothe i cannot think of many movies that literally keep the viewer chained to their seat from start to finish and this is definitely one of them even if you want to stop watching you wont be able to because of the sheer power of this movie the directors have filmed this movie very well and they help to set the plot through the good scenery the acting in this movie is great but if there is any drawback it is that some parts are very powerful and may disturb some people whilst the concept of this film is very dark the young children help to portray the idea through brilliant acting this really is a spine tingly movie and it is guaranteed to have you at the edge of your seat throughout i would highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys horror disturbing and powerful movies or anyone who just wants to see something different
i loved this movie from the opening sequence right through to the end i found the director actor s style of directly addressing me the audience very engaging what i found most exciting and refreshing about this movie was its ignoring and thus challenging of gender and class stereotypes the idiosyncrasies of the characters are portrayed as strengths and the absence of judgment and the characters acceptance of themselves and each other enabled me to embrace them and allow myself to be drawn into their world without preaching and with intelligence and gentle and loving humor this movie has the power to open us to new possibilities and offers hope for a world in which people see and accept each other as unique and precious individuals i look forward to more offerings from this creative and talented director
this murder mystery with musical numbers is long on atmosphere and character but rather short on suspense and plausibility based on a stage play by broadway showman earl carroll and others it combines a whodunit plot with a backstage ambiance a homicide investigation takes place on opening night at the theatre where a musical revue is being staged the cast is impressive and varied tough goofy victor mclaglen as the police officer who leads the investigation and never fails to leer idiotically at whatever showgirl happens to be in sight jack oakie the prewar jack lemmon or was jack lemmon the postwar jack oakie as the harassed director who must coordinate the staged performance as well as the chaos behind the scenes the ever homely jessie ralph as a wardrobe mistress with deep dark secrets dorothy stickney who has a stunning close up monologue near the end as the tremulous maid madly in love with the male lead carl brisson the danish star as that very male lead warbling the classic cocktails for two not once but twice kitty carlisle operatically delivering where do they come from and where do they go and other johnston coslow songs the glorious gertrude michael who parted from us too soon as a mean spirited showgirl whose love for brisson is spurned the usually ridiculous toby wing who here at least is the center of a laugh getting running joke when the plot complications get out of hand there is always an interesting performer or fun and tuneful musical number to distract the viewer the film s most celebrated sequence is the marahuana number led by michaels but aside from its controversial history it s really one of the lesser musical offerings all of the songs here are staged as if they could actually have fit into a standard proscenium theatre space as opposed to the cinematic fantasy setup of the busby berkeley style
yes its an art to successfully make a slow paced thriller the story unfolds in nice volumes while you don t even notice it happening fine performance by robin williams the sexuality angles in the film can seem unnecessary and can probably affect how much you enjoy the film however the core plot is very engaging the movie doesn t rush onto you and still grips you enough to keep you wondering the direction is good use of lights to achieve desired affects of suspense and unexpectedness is good very nice time watch if you are looking to lay back and hear a thrilling short story
long before tim lahaye and jerry b jenkins would shake the world of the christian subculture and make millions in the process with the left behind books mark iv pictures the christian film distribution company of the billy graham evangelistic association gave us this masterwork what i love most about this genre is its incredible attention to detail sitting in a living room instead of taking us to the dramatic scenes of this post rapture tribulation we sit in the living room hearing about it on the news because the filmmakers can t afford to show it the film s premise is grounded in pre millenial pre tribulation eschatalogy believing that christ comes once for the secret taking of the true church and then comes again at the end of the seven years of hell on earth what used to terrify me in junior high now makes me laugh the intriguing adventures of patty and her journey throughout the tribulation and two of the film s three sequels tells her remarkable story of unbelief and ultimately damnation i hate to admit it but i still thoroughly enjoy watching this it even has the same exact score of monty python and the holy grail i think i m the only person in history to make that observation
i loved this movie for two reasons jeff combs is absolutely wonderful in it plays the role of the modern wizard to the hilt and is absolutely adorable the movie helped to inspire a role playing game i thoroughly enjoy mage the awakening i ve shown it at various larp after parties and it s always a big hit d d love and jeff squeeing aside it s not exactly a masterpiece but it s well done and thoroughly enjoyable the plot is fast moving and engaging in its simplicity the special effects are pretty good for such a low budget and the script while nothing stellar was not too badly done and cheesy in all the right places a good way to spend an evening
of those comments here before mine i mostly agree with edyarb s the story and the script apparently had potential to be funny but though managing at some points in other places it failed you could see them wanting to make a joke but no one in the audience laughed also agree with edyarb s view on the end credits leave it normal or make it cool but not what they ve done now ok that gives a more negative feeling than what i actually had watching the movie i enjoyed it it was pleasant entertainment for a night and definitely didn t feel like a waste of money to get the ticket the best jokes are the ones that go a little bit outside of the expected and are fairly mature like luke wilson s character matt asking the super chick p nis or bed when she told him she d get him a new one after a wild night in bed ending up breaking the bed and leaving matt sore i cannot however agree with bgs who says that the film could earn an r rating there was absolutely nothing in the film to justify that some sexual acts yes but nothing explicit only humorous and no nudity whatsoever maybe he was at a prescreening that showed more i d like to compare this to two recent films i went to see with no expectations whatsoever superman returns and click i didn t really expect anything from either one i was a big fan of the original superman films and the trailer for click only showed it as a potentially chauvinistic which i wouldn t oppose film superman surprised me with actually having me feel good goosebumps about seeing his first heroic deed like seeing a long lost friend and feeling happy about it but for the rest of the story i d rather watch my super ex girlfriend at least it offers some surprises click again was a total surprise much better and deeper than the trailer and about five minutes away from being a really excellent movie the jokes also work much better than in ex girlfriend both the naughty ones and the more advanced ones anyway the only reason i compared these three films is that they are the three last ones i ve seen within a very short period and also because i went to all of these with basically no expectations at all i d rank them click girlfriend superman
i am glad being able to say almost only positive things about the movie with karas and the tasuiev sisters renaissance and firstly that it looks as it ought to look a boys adventure renaissance is the tale of a cop s investigation in search of a missing young scientist ilona tasuiev the geneticist and researcher for the avalon company the tale of karas ilona and bislane is though much less known than sin city the better movie and the one more appreciated by the connoisseurs to the french comics aficionados it will be even more meaningful i have enriched my french comics collection last week though i m not so up to date the atmosphere the music the characters their lines the plot are all nice and endearing a parisian top cop karas is displayed to find a young woman who was a rising star of medical genetic research ilona tasuiev a mildly hot blonde whose rebel sister bislane was erotically preferable i guess for me an oldie aficionado of comics and tv series renaissance a marvelously beautiful cartoon was like a replay of a wild wild west episode here a mythological past replaced with an equally mythological future more jaded and blas but in a sense as thrilling renaissance is not suspenseful nor does it look especially well paced but it s seducing and hypnotic moreover it achieves sketching albeit briefly a world a true world and we will think about the avalon nakata jonas mueller the tasuiev sisters and goran farfella and karas telling of his distant childhood in kasbah i liked renaissance s feel of a certain gentleness and affability and adventurousness and also the professional assured look among these new cartoons this one and linklater s dick adaptation the only and first dick adaptation ever stood out for me as works of beauty and genuine excitement i thought the futuristic devices were appropriate and when not conventional vividly eerie like the invisibility costumes as advisable the characters have exotic names like bislane and farfella mostly gathered from the arts and entertainment s world goran and ilona and naghib none seems to have noticed that renaissance s poster features a rourke look alike that guy is marv which doesn t make it a sin city rip off but not a paragon of originality either and in fact there s more resemblance to the miller tale namely the bleak futuristic look of a decayed society the brio of the hero in fact a cross of willis character and rourke s persona in the previous movie on the other hand this cartoon breathes a more public air a brim of straight adventurousness and in a word it s like sin city for kids well naughtier kids i mean cause there s a bit of nudity on display to what i have said one might retort that the traits mentioned are characteristic even as clich s and common places of the futuristic more adult comics look true enough and it was oldie miller to have brought that things on screen and renaissance bears some resemblances here and there now it s also fair that every ring ought to have its eragorn so to each sin city its renaissance i admit being quite partial to these bleak futuristic tales a rather undemanding specialty
man on fire tells a story of an ex special forces guy with a drinking problem who accepts a job as a personal bodyguard of a little girl in mexico during the wave of kidnappings for ransom at first he s not to friendly but then they befriend with each other he decides to stop drinking etc etc then one day she gets kidnapped and killed and he won t stop at anything to get the revenge that s basically the story of man on fire but expect some big twists at least a few times including the ending which is beautiful and will probably make you cry that s also because of the great music harry gregson williams with lisa gerrard gladiator composed but the strongest part of the movie wait the thing is everything here is perfect first acting denzel washington is at his best mickey rourke and christopher walken good as always great radtha mitchell and amazing young dakota fanning and that s not the end of the list then come the cinematography which is dazzling and along with superb editing should have won an oscar for sure the story is not just a revenge movie the story is intelligent the story makes you think and is pure beautiful really this is one of those movies you need to see in your lifetime at least once
having heard quite positive reviews and having seen the trailer i had to see this movie with william h macy luis guzman michael jeter and sam rockwell present it had to be good and it delivered overall the movie is not crack you up funny but there is one scene that really stands out and is in a my eyes a classic spoiler at the end where they break through the wall to get to the safe and we see rockwell and washington stare at jeter is just fantastic this is just as good as the scene in the big lebowski where the dude is using a chair to barricade his door but forgets the door turns outward end spoiler just go see this movie you won t be disappointed

i actually didn t start watching the show until it came on fx i was bored and had nothing to watch and saw that the show s reruns were premiering so i decided to watch it i was so upset that i had not watched the show when it first aired on t v i loved the show so much finally a show for everyone to enjoy i remember full house and family matters and step by step and they were okay shows but just not funny enough they would make dumb jokes and laugh over things that were just plain stupid but not that s show that s show was hilarious smart and so real i think it was the best show ever made and i m very sorry that it ended although i love this show i do think it should have ended on the seventh season when eric and kelso leave the last season was just not right eric was the main character and the show should have ended when his character leaves i still love this show and i hope tv starts making more shows like this one
shore leave is mostly an average star trek adventure nothing wrong with the episode though i simply think that this is not the best representation of what the show had to offer to fans it is lightweight entertaining nothing more however i m glad to see that a tv show of this type had enough good sense to take a break from serious intergalactic conflicts in this episode kirk decides to grant his crew some time off and a landing party is beamed down to a planet that looks like the perfect place for a vacation as usual the planet is not as peaceful as it appears to be there are some action and tense moments but most of the story is played for laughs good but unexceptional
an excellent family movie gives a lot to think on there s absolutely nothing wrong in this film everything is just perfect the script is great it s so real such things could happen in everyone s life and don t forget about acting it s just awesome just look at frankie and you ll know what i thought about this picture is a real can t miss
red rock west nicolas cage gets embroiled in a deadly crime without at first knowing it and the dominos lead to increasing peril adventure and misadventure in the wild forlorn american west of the s red rock west is often brutal and sometimes hilarious and cage pulls off the mixture with his usual sardonic wit and wary ease is the plot over the top yes is dennis hopper perfect as a crazed almost likable killer yes does cage stand a chance well you have to watch and see it never lets up and it took me by surprise the first time i saw it on second viewing yesterday i was surprised at how well it held up how well constructed it was and how macabre and funny it was at the same time director ron dahl who also helped write is known more for his tv work but with rounders and this film he shows a deft hand with sensational plots it s saved by its humor by the way and by the caricatures the bar is sleazy the cops questionable and don t miss a really inspired cameo by dwight yoakam as a truck driver
what can i say ms erika eleniak is my favorite blonde girl ever and like a italian american fan number one of female beauty i can t forget this movie you know i really don t remember a lot about the plot or the situations or the other actors i only can remember about drop dead gorgeous erika and that in this film she looks better than ever i really don t care if it was a bad movie or a good movie i only care the nice moments i had been a teenager in brooklyn just contemplating erika s beauty well just to conclude if you are an erika eleniak s beauty fan like me definitely this film is for you
the spoiler warning is for those people who want to see for themselves what animals and landscapes pass before their eyes although i don t mention it in great detail earth is an approx minute cinema version based on planet earth which i watched all on bbc tv the tv version was narrated by david attenborough a captivating commentator who i had wished had also done it for earth but it is patrick stewart star trek s captain picard there are regularly shots of the earth from space so that s may be appropriate in any case he has a nice enough and calm voice for it there are chapters in which we follow animal life on earth from north pole to antarctica animal families polar bear elephant and whale appear in more than one of these parts each chapter starts with an indication how far from north pole or equator it is we see something of each kind of animal but only mammals and birds and some fish and some beautiful shots of vegetation mountains waterfalls deserts and jungle a near perfect presentation of the variety of life and landscapes and climates on earth you get the impression that our planet is only inhabited by animals people or villages or cities aren t in the film so it s a typical nature documentary but breathtakingly shot and accompanied by delightful music when the film opened i already knew it would end far too soon for me it is a family film so no brutal killings of any animals when one is caught by his hunter the shot ends and in other cases where we see the prey being caught it s shot in slow motion which makes it less violent and watchable for young children age limit in the netherlands no blood is shed some scenes newly born animals are really cute and will be adored by kids it looks like an ordinary nature film but when you know how many shooting days it took and how much money it has cost it becomes an even more astonishing piece of beauty it had it s dutch premiere yesterday a month before the actual release in a cinema of seats of which were taken true beauty is rarely interesting for cinema goers it seems as i knew the tv series i was of course very curious if my favourite scenes would make it into this movie some didn t but the most impressive shots big waterfalls did luckily it was the first time i ever cried in a nature film
though not a horror film in the traditional sense this creepy little film delivers the goods it seems a vampire is loose in a small german town draining its victims of their blood police inspector karl brettschneider melvyn douglas in one of his early roles is skeptical believing a crazed killer not a vampire is running amok the only one who believes him is ruth bertin faye wray the inspector s girlfriend and lab assistant to dr otto von niemann lionel atwill who though apparently an eminent scientist goes along with the vampire theory the townspeople suspect the weirdo herman gleib played with his usual frenzy by dwight frye who seems to be having a lot of fun with his role the film contains quite a bit of humor which helps relieve some of the intensity involved with all the murders being committed one funny part has gussie schnappmann maude eburne ruth bertin s aunt thinking weird herman has turned not into a bat but into a dog maude eburne and dwight frye make a good comedy team this budget movie brings in elements from the cabinet of dr caligari with dr niemann using the power of suggestion to make a somnambulist carry out his orders from frankenstein by using the human blood to help create life in the laboratory and dracula since the murders are believed by everyone except the inspector and his girl to be the work of a bloodsucker thses elements are mixed well by director frank r strayer with a little comedy thrown in for good measure the concoction works the restored version i viewed used tinting to increase the spooky atmosphere so try to see the this version if possible
this was what black society was like before the crack epidemics gangsta rap and aids that beset the ghettos in the eighties decent hardworking families that struggled to get by and all the traumas and tribulations they faced black america was a different group of people in the seventies still full of hope and flying high on the civil rights movements of the sixties times were hard but still worth fighting for keepin your head above water making a wave when you can this show showed how black society struggled to work together as people and families before they started to prey on each other and everyone else in order to survive the horrors of the ghettos it is heart breaking to see what the black ghettos were like then and what they have become now

vaguely reminiscent of great s westerns like the treasure of the sierra madre red rock west is a story about conscience greed and betrayal michael nicolas cage is a down and out but honest young man from texas who goes west in search of work and money he finds both but not in the way he had expected the film s screenplay contains plenty of surprises and plot twists excellent cinematography adroit film editing and moody western music add tension and suspense the expansiveness of the big sky country provides a wonderful setting and the acting ranges from good to excellent with great performances from dennis hopper and j t walsh dwight yoakam s specially recorded country western song provides the film with a strong finale correctly labeled as neo noir red rock west strikes me as being something else as well the plot is full of amazing coincidences and improbable timing so much so that others may regard the screenplay as flawed ordinarily i would agree in this case however when combined with the moody atmosphere and the fact that the small town of red rock seems almost empty of normal daily life the coincidences and unlikely timing suggest a story that beyond noirish is surreal it s almost as if fate deliberately intervenes with improbable events so as to force michael to come to grips with himself from this point of view the coincidences are not script flaws at all they are necessary plot points in a nightmarish story of a young man who must confront his own demons disguised as other characters all we need here is rod serling in a postscript explaining in his always clearly enunciated voice that a young man searching for himself stops in a small almost deserted town a thousand miles from nowhere it s his final layover in a journey to the twilight zone
i admit i had no idea what to expect before viewing this highly stylized piece it could have been the cure for a zombie virus or the common cold for all i knew it began with great visuals little snippets to grab your attention and cause your imagination to run wild as it continued i learned quickly through voice overs what was taking place a nice little neo noir story that i felt was not a waist of a few minutes of my time the little clues given to the audience through visuals at the beginning give them a sense of accomplishment as they piece together the plot along with a nice twist at the end its a cool package overall the score though not bad gave the film almost a music video feel it just felt a little dated not adding anything to further the storyline some of the performances felt overly dramatic but fit perfectly with the feel of the overall piece i walk away from this very satisfied i was given a lot of information in a short period of time but through great editing and voice over work it didn t feel rushed or pushed great job
to me the final scene in which harris responds to the press corp is worthy of viewing this intelligent and timeless slice of politics especially the campaign phase if only the real life pols would respond in the intelligent articulate manner as did mr harris then the arrogant self serving members of the press would perhaps think twice before surfacing irrelevant confrontational garbage that has absolutely nothing to do with a candidates abilities to effectively handle the challenges of the office for which he she is pursuing
this is by far the funniest short made by the two comic geniuses from the time they walk in to the time hardy just falls off the roof this keeps me laughing hysterically i highly suggest that every fan of laurel and hardy should see this short i also recommend all of the ghost series if you are looking for laughs see this movie and you will be happy
last november i had a chance to see this film at the reno film festival i have to say that it was a lot of fun a few tech errors aside it was a great experience i loved the writing and acting especially from the guy that played the lead role there is a lot of heart in this movie a lot of wit to i got a chance to speak with a few of the filmmakers after it was done and they seemed real nice all in all the whole movie was just a positive experience and one i d definitely recommend the story was entertaining and cool as a woman i ve been through a lot of the same problems as the lead guy and i could really understand his problems because of it the movie does a great job of giving us people we can sympathize with the friends in the movie are really well written to they are realistic i know people like these i only wish imy friends and i could sound as cool as these people when we talk the whole movie is just real cool i wish there were more films out there like it jayden
first off i d like to make a correction on another review of this film which said that the last musical to win the best picture academy award was gigi in that is misinformation as west side story won in my fair lady won in and sound of music won the year after that that said this film is absolutely fantastic the story from the novel has been somewhat altered but that s more because of the limitations that they had on a stage that they just didn t change back for a filmed version however i don t mind in fact i rather think the whole production flows better than the novel does i like nancy bringing oliver to the bridge with her and being killed there instead of later in the apartment the subtle things in this film are the ones that make me laugh i love the moment mr bumble and mrs bumble start coming out at the beginning from the governors office the underscore for that moment is brilliant my three favorite actors for this film were jack wild who plays the best dodger in any film version of the story ron moody a playful and humorous fagin this character is worked out much better than he is in the book and shani wallis who is the strongest most distressed version of nancy the only reason i m giving this film a instead of a is because of the two big production numbers which are concider yourself and who will buy i always hate when the choreography in musicals in meant to look like people doing everyday chores and jobs it looks awful and cheesy especially when they re dancing at the london meat co they should ve just done regular choreography for these scenes however this film is a rare treasure that will stay with us hopefully forever
while originally reluctant to jump on the bandwagon of watching lost i accidentally caught one episode at the beginning of season the one with the polar bear and it has had my undivided attention ever since the show that is not the polar bear so bear heh with me while i throw out as much rambling semi coherent praise as i can muster lost takes a simple idea of a passenger flight full of people crashing onto a desert island and gradually adds extraordinary depth to its premise by exploring each character deeply and unflinchingly what drives them who are they where did they come from it soon becomes clear that the island upon which they are stranded acts as a common denominator for many things in their lives whether they re running away from something sawyer and kate among others or getting in touch with spirituality locke claire but lost also zooms in on the island itself and the mysterious horrors that it houses and they all seem to be strangely connected while television actors are not exactly known for their subtlety or dazzling acting abilities most of the cast of lost are in truth spectacular actors for their respective parts projecting heart and humour in their performances there s also a multitude of eyecandy but not generally of the plastic hollywood kind as most tv shows the characters all feel very real and they are extremely compelling to watch their interactions rarely fall prey to predictable sappiness petty arguments or cheesy melodrama although they are annoyingly secretive these people are first and foremost trying to survive and whatever relationship appears is treated secondary to action the realism of these characters facilitate an already well sculptured plot about this plot imagine a tree as the template plot then the branches as subplots in this case one branch for every character well lost adds twigs to each branch and then tiny twigs to those twigs as other story lines if you re a brother sister to one of the main characters in the flashbacks you will get your own storyline if you re a dog you will have your own storyline unless the writers manage to weave them all together into some glorious culmination in the end they are setting themselves up i am more than a little worried there will be some disappointing cop out to this show as i m sure most people are but assuming the writers do pull this off lost is possibly the best show ever to hit television
i heard about this movie when watching vh s most metal moments on the segment gene simmons who played a cameo and several other interviewees discussed how utterly awful this movie is unlike most people i m often more curious about checking out movies that have reputations for being ridiculously bad than say a masterpiece of cinema the advantage of having that sort of attitude is half the time i find out that the movies are nowhere near as bad as people said and i end up enjoying them a lot more than i initially expected that was my experience with trick or treat now it s hard to make a movie about a teenage boy who receives messages from a dead heavy metal star by playing one of his vintage records backwards without people scoffing at the premise sure it s certainly a strange premise but one that s never been done before give the filmmakers points for originality for pete s sake if you re looking to buy the dvd having no prior knowledge of the movie don t be fooled into thinking ozzy osbourne and gene simmons are the stars however though simmons has a thankless role ozzy does have a funny cameo as a reverend that s right a reverend who speaks out against heavy metal for one thing it s funny seeing ozzy with short hair and for another thing you can t help but laugh at the irony sure it s a cheap shot but an effective one the acting is pretty good i found the performances convincing the teen characters are horribly clich d so expect the usual array of jocks and nerds and like in every one of these movies the pretty girl is a decent person who has sympathy for the alienated main character yet continues to go out with her jock boyfriend why s she going out with such a complete jerk in the first place because the plot needs an obstacle no other reason but i can t deny that one of my guilty pleasures is watching the evil jocks in these movies go down since i was an outcast in high school the movie kept my interest for the most part but the third act is way too conventional and caused me to roll my eyes as there would be one predictable situation after another but altogether the film is not at all bad and definitely worth viewing on a rainy day out of
i ve never been huge on imax films they re cool but once you get over that initial rush of whoa it feels like flying the movies themselves are usually pretty corny and ordinary the exceptions have been the powerful everest the exhilarating wild california and now the bbc s the human body a super sized look at the insides of our bodies our bodies are machines of a complexity that is simply inconceivable this minute film could be hours long and still wouldn t get to all of the systems working in tandem just as i type this review and listen to my radio and most of us take it all for granted here you can see the inside of a pumping heart looks like an alien spaceship the inside of your lungs the tiny hairs in your eardrum that process sound the development of a baby inside a mother s womb and surprisingly a few of the um less attractive functions that i thought it would shy away from pimples the churning of acids in the stomach this film also has a rather funky style to it which sets it apart from other imax documentaries for instance we ve all seen sperm finding its way to the egg but have you ever seen it set to the tune of marvin gaye s let s get it on it s creative moments like that that make the human body not just a health lesson but fun as well
i saw this movie as a child and it broke my heart no other story had such a unfinished ending i grew up on many great anime movies and this was one of my favourites because it was so unusual a story about unfairness and cruelty and loneliness and life and choices that can t be undone and the need for others chirin is made alone when the wolf kills his mother but the wolf is alone too when chirin follows him into the mountain the wolf doesn t kill the lamb even though each night he says maybe i ll eat you tomorrow the tape of it i have is broken and degraded from age and use i will repair it and watch the movie again someday and cry just as hard as i did as a child stories like this with this depth and feeling and this intricacy of meaning are very rare it is a sad story but i ve never encountered any catharsis more beautifully made i am glad i have seen this movie and i m glad i saw it as a child
